However, biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning could differ between ecosystem types and evaluating these associations could help assess ecosystem recovery in restoration sites. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of species richness and plant functional traits on ecological processes related to nutrient cycling, productivity and regeneration in subtropical forest ecosystems. The study was performed in three sites (each site containing a reference forest and a forest undergoing restoration) located in the south of Brazil. We collected data on understory abundance, aboveground biomass, litter stock, decomposition, soil feeding activity, litter and soil quality and evaluated the association with tree species richness and plant traits (both community-weighted mean trait values-CWM, and functional diversity measures). Variables related to plant functional traits, especially CWM measures, were associated with most of the ecological processes analyzed. Leaf traits showed the strongest effect on the processes, especially for aboveground biomass, litter stock and understory abundance. Most relationships did not differ between reference and restoration sites. Our results support the mass-ratio theory, suggesting that dominant species traits are the ones that strongly affect ecosystem functioning, and suggest a secondary role of species number on the ecological processes analyzed. Our study provides evidence for the usefulness of functional traits to assess changes in ecological processes in forest ecosystems, with similar patterns in reference forests and forests undergoing restoration.","[Rosenfield, Milena Fermina; Muller, Sandra Cristina] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Ecol Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Rosenfield, MF (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Ecol Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",milenarosenfield@gmail.com,"Müller, Sandra/G-3739-2012; Rosenfield, Milena Fermina/D-3110-2019","Müller, Sandra/0000-0002-6316-2897; Rosenfield, Milena Fermina/0000-0002-1799-2822",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [309874/2015-7]; CAPES for the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES for the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank Ana Flavia Boeni, Debora Fonseca, Jessica Schuler and Rene Porciuncula for help in collecting the data and to Suzi Camey for statistical help.

We tested the biomass ratio hypothesis, which postulates that ecosystem properties should depend on species traits and on species contribution to the total biomass of the community, in a successional sere following vineyard abandonment in the Mediterranean region of France. Ecosystem-specific net primary productivity, litter decomposition rate, and total soil carbon and nitrogen varied significantly with field age, and correlated with community-aggregated (i.e., weighed according to the relative abundance of species) functional leaf traits. The three easily measurable traits tested, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and nitrogen concentration, provide a simple means to scale up from organ to ecosystem functioning in complex plant communities. We propose that they be called functional markers, and be used to assess the impacts of community changes on ecosystem properties induced, in particular, by global change drivers.","Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, Dept Sci Protect Plantes & Ecol, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Garnier, E (autor correspondente), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",garnier@cefe.cnrs-mop.fr,"Garnier, Eric/CAH-9875-2022; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",,,,NA,54,1412,1508,52,752,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2004,85,9,,,,NA,2630,2637,,10.1890/03-0799,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0799,NA,,8,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,860YE,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000224379600028,View Full Record in Web of Science,Berga,sim,,sim,sim,não,grassland,temperate,na,2,,"SLA,LDMC,LNC",na,negativa,positive,na,negativa,,,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of traits that mediate the response of plant species to the environment is well established, but the identification of effect traits and the linkage between the two sets is less developed. This was attempted for a study of eight contrasting land uses in a marginal agricultural landscape where data on vegetation, management controls of the disturbance regime, and soil characteristics, including nitrogen release, were measured simultaneously with measures of ecosystem function such as litter decomposition rates and primary productivity on 30 sites. Trait data were assembled from databases, and an iterative multivariate approach using the three table (species, trait, environment) method RLQ was employed to identify a parsimonious set of traits that predict plant species responses to the environment and a parsimonious set of traits that link vegetation to ecosystem function. The lists of response and effect traits were similar, and where differences were observed, traits were usually highly correlated with at least one trait in the other list. This approach identified a small number of traits (canopy height, leaf dry matter content, leaf size, and specific leaf area) that provide a means of linking vegetation responses to environmental change with changes in ecosystem function. Other response traits included vegetative spread strategy, start of flowering, and seed terminal velocity, but within the system studied these traits were all significantly correlated to the traits shared between the response and effect lists.","Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",r.pakeman@macaulay.ac.uk,"Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015","Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133",,,,NA,39,76,76,4,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2011,92,6,,,,NA,1353,1365,,10.1890/10-1728.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1728.1,NA,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,791BD,21797163,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000292633900017,View Full Record in Web of Science,Berga,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,grassland/woodland,temperate,na,,,"Bud height,canopy height,canopy structure,flowering start,flowering end,LDMC,leaf size,leafing period,life span,SLA,pollen vector,seed longevity,SM,terminal velocity,varince in seed dimension,vegetative spread,",na,positiva com eixo1,negativa com eixo1,na,na,,,na,ns,na,negativa com eixo1 (*canopy height(,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,ns,,,,,,,,,sim OK,,,,,,,,,,,"este trabalho usou a analise RLQ, uma ordenação com base nas spp, atributos e ambiente.

Scaling traits to community scales for predicting ecosystem functions (i.e., GPP) remain challenging, while it is promising and well appreciated with the rapid development of trait-based ecology. In this study, we aim to integrate multiple plant traits with the recently developed trait-based productivity (TBP) theory, verify it via Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM) and complementary independent effect analysis. We further distinguish the relative importance of different traits in explaining the variation in GPP. We apply the TBP theory based on plant community traits to a multi-trait dataset containing more than 13,000 measurements of approximately 2,500 species in Chinese forest and grassland systems. Remarkably, our SEM accurately predicts variation in annual and monthly GPP across China (R-2 values of 0.87 and 0.73, respectively). Plant community traits play a key role. This study shows that integrating multiple plant functional traits into the TBP theory strengthens the quantification of ecosystem primary productivity variability and further advances understanding of the trait-productivity relationship. Our findings facilitate integration of the growing plant trait data into future ecological models. Integration of plant functional traits into trait-based productivity theory helps quantify primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng; Xu, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng; Xu, Li] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kailiang] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ USA; [Yu, Kailiang] Princeton Univ, High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ USA; [Xu, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Earth Crit Zone & Flux Res Stn Xingan Mt, Daxinganling 165200, Peoples R China; [Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven Plant Inst, Leuven, Belgium","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; KU Leuven; Northeast Forestry University - China; Princeton University; Princeton University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; KU Leuven","He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953","National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFF080210102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42141004, 31988102]; CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research [YSBR-037]; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China [2019FY101300]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China,"We thank all the members who have participated in field investigation over the eight years to assist us in collecting the data.

Yet, it remains unclear how and which plant traits regulate the assembly process and thus affect ecosystem structure and function under climate changes. Here, we selected six steppe sites with snow fences along a precipitation gradient in inner Mongolia. We measured traits including plant height and leaf carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. We incorporated intraspecific trait variation to quantify the strength of external filters (assembly processes outside the community at a larger spatial scale), the strength of internal filters (assembly processes within the local community), and functional redundancy (the number of species having a similar function to an ecosystem). We applied these assembly rules to explain the changes in biodiversity and productivity in response to changing precipitation. We found that increased rainfall reduced plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) concentrations, but did not affect plant height. High snowfall increased phosphorous concentration, but did not affect other traits. Latent variable models identified climate (rainfall) and soil nutrient conditions (soil total N and P content) were more important than external filtering processes in predicting species richness. However, external filtering processes were the most important predictor of productivity. More specifically, we found with the increase in steppe productivity, the strength of the external filtering on leaf N increased and on plant height decreased, leading to leaf N converging into a small range but broadening the range of plant height. The internal filters had no significant effects on species richness or productivity. Additionally, we found that low precipitation reduced functional redundancy. We emphasize that intraspecific trait-variation drives plant productivity and richness responses to precipitation changes by regulating community assemblage. Our finding also underlines the importance to separate the contributions of different functional traits in regulating the responses of ecosystem structure and function to climate changes.","[Deng, Meifeng; Liu, Weixing; Li, Ping; Jia, Zhou; Yang, Sen; Guo, Lulu; Wang, Zhenhua; Liu, Lingli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Deng, Meifeng; Liu, Weixing; Li, Ping; Jia, Zhou; Yang, Sen; Guo, Lulu; Wang, Zhenhua; Liu, Lingli] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Li, Shaopeng] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; East China Normal University","Liu, LL (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Liu, LL (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",lingli.liu@ibcas.ac.cn,"Liu, Lingli/A-7771-2008; Li, Shao-peng/C-3983-2016","Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151; Li, Shao-peng/0000-0002-1730-3433","Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research [2019YFA0607302, 2017YFC0503900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31700420, 31670478, 31988102]",Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was financially supported by the Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research (2019YFA0607302, 2017YFC0503900), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700420, 31670478, 31988102).",NA,47,4,5,11,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,NA,,,e03707,10.1002/ecs2.3707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3707,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UG7VB,NA,gold,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000689453800035,View Full Record in Web of Science,Berga,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,grassland,temperada,na,,,"plant height, LNC,LPC,LCC",na,na,na,na,positiva,,,na,na,ns,negativa,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,,,,,,,,,sim OK,,,,,,,,,,,"este trabalho usou análise de caminhos para avaliar drivers da produtividade.

Vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes, such as aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), are increasingly being modeled as a function of the quantitative traits of species, which are used as proxies for photosynthetic rates and nutrient and water-use efficiency. These approaches rely on an assumption that a certain trait value consistently confers a specific function or response under given environmental conditions. Here, we provide a critical test of this idea and evaluate whether the functional traits that drive the well-known relationship between precipitation and ANPP differ between systems with distinct biogeographic histories and species assemblages. Specifically, we compared grasslands spanning a broad precipitation gradient (similar to 200-1,000 mm/y) in North America and South Africa that differ in the relative representation and abundance of grass phylogenetic lineages. We found no significant difference between the regions in the positive relationship between annual precipitation and ANPP, yet the trait values underlying this relationship differed dramatically. Our results challenge the trait-based approach to predicting ecosystem function by demonstrating that different combinations of functional traits can act to maximize ANPP in a given environmental setting. Further, we show the importance of incorporating biogeographic and phylogenetic history in predicting community and ecosystem properties using traits.","[Forrestel, Elisabeth J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Viticulture & Enol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Forrestel, Elisabeth J.; Donoghue, Michael J.; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Edwards, Erika J.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Jetz, Walter] Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [du Toit, Justin C.

Although both mechanisms have been studied in plant communities and experiments at small spatial extents, it remains unclear whether evidence from small-extent case studies translates into a generalizable macroecological pattern. Here, we evaluate dominance and niche partitioning effects simultaneously in grassland systems world-wide.Location: Two thousand nine hundred and forty-one grassland plots globally.Time period: 2000-2014.Major taxa studied: Vascular plants.Methods: We obtained plot-based data on functional community structure from the global vegetation plot database sPlot , which combines species composition with plant trait data from the TRY  database. We used data on the community-weighted mean (CWM) and FD for 18 ecologically relevant plant traits. As an indicator of primary productivity, we extracted the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS. Using generalized additive models and deviation partitioning, we estimated the contributions of trait CWM and FD to the variation in annual maximum NDVI, while controlling for climatic variables and spatial structure.Results: Grassland communities dominated by relatively tall species with acquisitive traits had higher NDVI values, suggesting the prevalence of dominance effects for BEF relationships. We found no support for niche partitioning for the functional traits analysed, because NDVI remained unaffected by FD. Most of the predictive power of traits was shared by climatic predictors and spatial coordinates. This highlights the importance of community assembly processes for BEF relationships in natural communities.Main conclusions: Our analysis provides empirical evidence that plant functional community structure and global patterns in primary productivity are linked through the resource economics and size traits of the dominant species. This is an important test of the hypotheses underlying BEF relationships at the global scale.","[Engel, Thore] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Engel, Thore] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Comp Sci, Halle An Der Saale, Germany; [Engel, Thore] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany; [Engel, Thore; Bruelheide, Helge; Hoss, Daniela; Sabatini, Francesco M.; Dengler, Juergen; Jandt, Ute; Kattge, Jens; Roemermann, Christine] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Engel, Thore; Hoss, Daniela; Velez-Martin, Eduardo; Pillar, Valerio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Bruelheide, Helge; Sabatini, Francesco M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle An Der Saale, Germany; [Sabatini, Francesco M.] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BiGeA, BIOME Lab, Bologna, Italy; [Sabatini, Francesco M.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Engel, Thore; Altman, Jan; Cerny, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Arfin-Khan, Mohammed A.

However, they have rarely been used in forest-steppe ecotones. These ecosystems are extremely sensitive to disturbances due to their relatively complex ecosystem structures, func-tionings and processes. In this study, we selected seven sites along a transect from closed canopy forests (CF) to forest-steppe ecotones (FSE) and meadow steppes (MS) in northeast China. Six leaf functional traits (i.e. leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents, leaf length and thickness, single leaf area and leaf mass per unit area, LMA) as well as the community composition and aboveground biomass at each site were measured. Both functional trait diversity indices (richness, evenness and divergence) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs) were calculated to quantify community trait distributions. We found that dominant species in the FSE communities showed acquisitive strategies with highest leaf nitrogen (Mean +/- SE: 19.6 +/- 0.5 mg g-1) and single leaf area (19.2 +/- 1.3 cm2), but the lowest LMA (59.6 +/- 1.3 g cm-2) values compared to adjacent CF and MS communities. The ecotone communities also exhibited the largest functional trait richness (TOP), evenness (TED) and divergence (FDis) values (0.46, 0.92 and 0.67, respectively). Overall, niche differentiation emerges as the main mechanism influencing the coexistence of plant species in ecotone ecosystems. In addition, CWMs of leaf traits were the most important predictors for es-timating variations in aboveground productivity across the transect, suggesting a major influence of dominant species. Our findings suggest that vegetation management practices in forest-steppe ecotones should increasingly focus on community functional trait diversity, and support the establishment and regeneration of plant species with rapid resource acquisition strategies.","[He, Peng; Ma, Chengcang] Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin Key Lab Anim & Plant Resistance, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Fontana, Simone] Univ Freiburg, Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Fontana, Simone] Abt Nat & Landschaft, Amt Nat,Jagd Fischerei, CH-9001 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Liu, Heyong; Wang, Ruzhen; Jiang, Yong; Li, Mai -He] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China; [Xu, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Mai -He] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Forest dynam, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Li, Mai -He] Northeast Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China","Tianjin Normal University; University of Freiburg; Hebei University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Northeast Normal University - China","Jiang, Y (autor correspondente), Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China.",liuheyong@hbu.edu.cn; xuli@igsnrr.ac.cn; ruzhenwang@hbu.edu.cn; jiangyong@hbu.edu.cn; maihe.li@wsl.ch,"Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; Fontana, Simone/HII-9457-2022","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Fontana, Simone/0000-0003-1194-1909",National Natural Science Foundation of China;  [32001147],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,"Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32001147) .

However, the succinct accounting of the linkages across the various forest types are lacking across the literature. Therefore, the objective of the study was to synthesize current knowledge about and ecosystem function and services along with their linkages to PFTs in temperate forest ecosystem. A systematic literature review with appropriate keywords and suitable inclusion and exclusion criterion was applied for generating of the information in accordance to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Forty-eight studies (31 on functional traits and 17 on linkages of PFT with various ecosystem services) reveals that aboveground biomass and wood productivity was associated with leaf morphological, chemical and stem traits, however, only a few studies dealt with leaf physiological, stoichiometry, regenerative and root traits. Litter decomposition was mostly associated with leaf chemical and morphological traits followed by leaf physiological and stoichiometry traits; however, evaluations between PFTs and ecosystem services (ESs) were categorically not accounted the association with stem, root and regenerative traits in temperate forests. Leaf morphological, chemical, stoichiometry and stem traits were important predictors of ecosystem process and functioning and facilitate for the measurements of ecosystem services. However, limited and skewed studies suggest more focus researches on physiological, regenerative and root traits in temperate forest for assessing the unexplored services. The state of the science information of temperate forest ecosystem services with traits relationship is useful for forest planning, management and maintaining multi-functionality and services of temperate forest besides identifies future priorities for forest sustainability.","[Rawat, Monika; Pandey, Rajiv] Indian Council Forestry Res Educ ICFRE, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Rajat; Sharma, Jyoti; Chand, Tara] Forest Res Inst, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Saklani, Himani; Bhatt, Indra Dutt] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Almora, Uttarakhand, India",Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Forest Research Institute (FRI); G.B.

In this study, we related the trait composition of plant communities to soil nutrients and disturbance as environmental drivers and to productivity, decomposition and soil carbon as ecosystem properties. We surveyed two sites, one comprising intensively grazed and fertilized grasslands, the other consisting of semi-natural grassland and open heathland. Species abundance and trait values of 149 species were recorded in 69 plots, as well as parameters describing soil resources, land-use disturbances, and ecosystem properties. Our main goal was to test whether the average or the diversity of the trait values of the vegetation had stronger effects on ecosystem properties (mass ratio vs. diversity hypothesis). Structural equation modeling was used to perform a simultaneous analysis of trait responses and effects. Specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents were always negatively correlated with stem dry matter content and canopy height, indicating greater investments in supportive and nutrient-conserving tissue as plants increased in size. In the agricultural site, disturbance was the single most important factor decreasing plant height, while leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents increased with soil resources in heathlands. Productivity was directly or indirectly driven by leaf traits, and investments in structural tissue increased standing biomass and soil carbon. Different environmental drivers in the two sites produced opposing leaf trait effects on litter decomposition. Ecosystem properties were explained by the community mean trait value as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Evidence for effects of functional diversity on productivity and other ecosystem properties was not detected, suggesting that diversity productivity relationships depend on the length of the investigated environmental gradients. We conclude that changes in community composition and dominance hierarchies deserve the most attention when ecosystem properties must he maintained.","[Lienin, Patrick; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Lienin, P (autor correspondente), Univ Connecticut, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",patrick.lienin@uconn.edu,,,"State of Lower-Saxony; Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany [ZN 2026]","State of Lower-Saxony; Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany(Volkswagen)","This study was conducted as part of a collaborative research project with the Hebrew University, Israel, and funded by the State of Lower-Saxony and the Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany (Grant No. ZN 2026).

It assumes that species traits are central to these impacts, and is designed to be applicable in different historical, climatic contexts and local settings. Preliminary results are presented to show its applicability. Methods Eleven sites, representative of various types of land-use changes occurring in marginal agro-ecosystems across Europe and Israel, were selected. Climatic data were obtained at the site level; soil data, disturbance and nutrition indices were described at the plot level within sites. Sixteen traits describing plant stature, leaf characteristics and reproductive phase were recorded on the most abundant species of each treatment. These data were combined with species abundance to calculate trait values weighed by the abundance of species in the communities. The ecosystem properties selected were components of above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition of litter. Key Results The wide variety of land-use systems that characterize marginal landscapes across Europe was reflected by the different disturbance indices, and were also reflected in soil and/or nutrient availability gradients. The trait toolkit allowed us to describe adequately the functional response of vegetation to land-use changes, but we suggest that some traits (vegetative plant height, stem dry matter content) should be omitted in studies involving mainly herbaceous species. Using the example of the relationship between leaf dry matter content and above-ground dead material, we demonstrate how the data collected may be used to analyse direct effects of climate and land use on ecosystem properties vs. indirect effects via changes in plant traits. Conclusions This work shows the applicability of a set of protocols that can be widely applied to assess the impacts of global change drivers on species, communities and ecosystems.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Stn Alpine Joseph Fourier, UMS 2925, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France; INRA, Equipe ORPHEE, UMR 1248, ARCHE, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; Univ Coimbra, Dept Bot, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal; Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Lab Rangeland Ecol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Universidade de Coimbra; Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Stockholm University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; James Hutton Institute; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Tel Aviv University; University of Sherbrooke,"Garnier, E (autor correspondente), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",eric.garnier@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Garnier, Eric/CAH-9875-2022; Freitas, Helena/ABE-6998-2020; Beemster, Gerrit/E-6668-2016; Robson, Thomas Matthew/J-3381-2012; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015; Doležal, Ji?í/H-1583-2014; Castro, Helena/AAO-6270-2021; Freitas, Helena/A-2803-2010; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012; Vile, Denis/A-5637-2008; Sternberg, Marcelo/AFQ-1615-2022; Quetier, Fabien/K-6872-2015","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Beemster, Gerrit/0000-0001-6014-053X; Robson, Thomas Matthew/0000-0002-8631-796X; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133; Castro, Helena/0000-0003-1818-1535; Freitas, Helena/0000-0002-1907-9615; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Vile, Denis/0000-0002-7948-1462; Sternberg, Marcelo/0000-0001-8710-4141; Golodets, Carly/0000-0001-6509-9716; Fortunel, Claire/0000-0002-8367-1605; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051; Rusch, Graciela/0000-0003-3769-8345; Quetier, Fabien/0000-0002-3767-0353",,,,NA,102,412,429,6,286,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

In addition to advancing understanding of the relationship between a climate-driven trait and ecosystem functioning, our findings suggest that leaf size can also be a promising tool in palaeoecology for scaling from fossil leaves to palaeo-primary productivity of woody ecosystems.","[Li, Yaoqi; Shrestha, Nawal; Lyu, Tong; Xu, Xiaoting; Li, Yichao; Zou, Dongting; Su, Xiangyan; Tang, Zhiyao; Wang, Zhiheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Inst Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Yaoqi; Shrestha, Nawal; Lyu, Tong; Maitner, Brian S.; Xu, Xiaoting; Li, Yichao; Zou, Dongting; Su, Xiangyan; Tang, Zhiyao; Wang, Zhiheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shrestha, Nawal] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Feng, Xiao; Enquist, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Inst Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Maitner, Brian S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Xu, Xiaoting] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Bioresource & Ecoenvironm, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Tan, Zheng-Hong] Hainan Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qinghua; Feng, Xiaojuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Peking University; Peking University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University; University of Zurich; Lanzhou University; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Sichuan University; Hainan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; The Santa Fe Institute","Wang, ZH (autor correspondente), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Inst Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Wang, ZH (autor correspondente), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zhiheng.wang@pku.edu.cn,"Tang, Zhiyao/B-8795-2008; Wang, Zhiheng/G-1750-2010; Shrestha, Nawal/ABA-3021-2020; Feng, Xiaojuan/I-6142-2013; Guo, Qinghua/B-7731-2012; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Wang, Zhiheng/0000-0003-0808-7780; Shrestha, Nawal/0000-0002-6866-5100; Feng, Xiaojuan/0000-0002-0443-0628; Guo, Qinghua/0000-0002-1065-0838; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Li, Yaoqi/0000-0001-6540-395X; Maitner, Brian/0000-0002-2118-9880; Xu, Xiaoting/0000-0001-8126-614X; Feng, Xiao/0000-0003-4638-3927","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31911530102, 31988102] Funding Source: Medline; University of Zurich Research Priority Program Funding Source: Medline; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Collaboration Team Funding Source: Medline",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); University of Zurich Research Priority Program; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Collaboration Team,,NA,72,28,31,25,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Support, however, comes mostly from experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales in low-diversity systems. Here, we test whether different species contribute to different ecosystem functions that are important for carbon cycling in a high-diversity human-modified tropical forest landscape in Southern Mexico. We quantified aboveground standing biomass, primary productivity, litter production, and wood decomposition at the landscape level, and evaluated the extent to which tree species contribute to these ecosystem functions. We used simulations to tease apart the effects of species richness, species dominance and species functional traits on ecosystem functions. We found that dominance was more important than species traits in determining a species' contribution to ecosystem functions. As a consequence of the high dominance in human-modified landscapes, the same small subset of species mattered across different functions. In human-modified landscapes in the tropics, biodiversity may play a limited role for ecosystem multifunctionality due to the potentially large effect of species dominance on biogeochemical functions. However, given the spatial and temporal turnover in species dominance, biodiversity may be critically important for the maintenance and resilience of ecosystem functions.","[Lohbeck, Madelon; Bongers, Frans; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Lohbeck, Madelon] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.;Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",madelon.lohbeck@wur.com,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875","SEP-CONACYT [2009-129740]; NSF [DEB 1147429, DEB 0639393]; NSF-LTREB; research program ALW [863.15.017]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Wageningen University and Research; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development) [W85-326]; MABOTRO [SEMARNAT-CONACYT 2002-C01-0597, SEP-CONACYT CB-2005-01-51043, PAPIIT-DGAPA IN213714]; DiverSus project [IAI CRN 2015, SGP-CRA2015]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [283093]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1147429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",SEP-CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-LTREB(National Science Foundation (NSF)); research program ALW; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Wageningen University and Research; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development); MABOTRO; DiverSus project; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"The authors thank Gilberto Jampangape for assistance during fieldwork and the community of Loma Bonita for assistance and hospitality.

While most studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have examined randomized species losses, trait-based filtering associated with species-specific vulnerability to drivers of diversity loss can strongly influence how ecosystem functioning responds to declining biodiversity. Moreover, the responses of ecosystem functioning to diversity loss may be mediated by environmental variability interacting with the suite of traits remaining in depauperate communities. We do not yet understand how communities resulting from realistic diversity losses (filtered by response traits) influence ecosystem functioning (via effect traits of the remaining community), especially under variable environmental conditions. Here, we directly test how realistic and randomized plant diversity losses influence productivity and invasion resistance across multiple years in a California grassland. Compared with communities based on randomized diversity losses, communities resulting from realistic (drought-driven) species losses had higher invasion resistance under climatic conditions that matched the trait-based filtering they experienced. However, productivity declined more with realistic than with randomized species losses across all years, regardless of climatic conditions. Functional response traits aligned with effect traits for productivity but not for invasion resistance. Our findings illustrate that the effects of biodiversity losses depend not only on the identities of lost species but also on how the traits of remaining species interact with varying environmental conditions. Understanding the consequences of biodiversity change requires studies that evaluate trait-mediated effects of species losses and incorporate the increasingly variable climatic conditions that future communities are expected to experience.","[Wolf, Amelia A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Funk, Jennifer L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Selmants, Paul C.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Morozumi, Connor N.] Emory Univ, Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hernandez, Daniel L.] Carleton Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Pasari, Jae R.] Portland State Univ, Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Zavaleta, Erika S.] Univ Calif Santa, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Emory University; Carleton College; Portland State University,"Wolf, AA (autor correspondente), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",amywolf@utexas.edu,"Funk, Jennifer/AAX-9325-2021","Wolf, Amelia/0000-0001-7660-3455; Morozumi, Connor/0000-0003-0235-3857; Selmants, Paul/0000-0001-6211-3957",NSF [DEB0918785],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by the NSF Grant DEB0918785.

Two main hypotheses have emerged that address B-EF relationships: niche complementarity (NC) and the mass-ratio (MR) effect. We tested the relative importance of these hypotheses in a subtropical old-growth forest on the island nation of Taiwan for two EFs: aboveground biomass (ABG) and coarse woody productivity (CWP). Functional dispersion (FDis) of eight plant functional traits was used to evaluate complementarity of resource use. Under the NC hypothesis, EF will be positively correlated with FDis. Under the MR hypothesis, EF will be negatively correlated with FDis and will be significantly influenced by community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values. We used path analysis to assess how these two processes (NC and MR) directly influence EF and may contribute indirectly to EF via their influence on canopy packing (stem density). Our results indicate that decreasing functional diversity and a significant influence of CWM traits were linked to increasing AGB for all eight traits in this forest supporting the MR hypothesis. Interestingly, CWP was primarily influenced by NC and MR indirectly via their influence on canopy packing. Maximum height explained more of the variation in both AGB and CWP than any of the other plant functional traits. Together, our results suggest that multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence EF, and understanding their relative importance will help to elucidate the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem function.","[Chiang, Jyh-Min; Lin, Yiching] Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Spasojevic, Marko J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama; [Sun, I-Fang] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan; [Su, Sheng-Hsin] Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Taipei 10066, Taiwan; [Chen, Zueng-Sang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Chem, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Teh] Natl Chung Hsin Univ, Dept Agron, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Swenson, Nathan G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [McEwan, Ryan W.] Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",Tunghai University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; National Dong Hwa University; National Taiwan University; National Chung Hsing University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Dayton,"Chiang, JM (autor correspondente), Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.",jyhmin@thu.edu.tw,"Chen, Chien-Teh/AAW-6030-2021; Su, Sheng-Hsin/AAC-3596-2021; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020","Chen, Chien-Teh/0000-0001-8721-165X; Su, Sheng-Hsin/0000-0003-1337-3335; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Muller-Landau, Helene C./0000-0002-3526-9021; Chiang, Jyh-Min/0000-0002-6293-1551","National Science Council of Taiwan [102-2313-B-029-003-MY3, 98-2313-B-029-001-MY3]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-1046113]; Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program; Council of Agriculture; National Science Council of Taiwan; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1354741] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program; Council of Agriculture; National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Council of Taiwan (102-2313-B-029-003-MY3, 98-2313-B-029-001-MY3 to J-MC), the US National Science Foundation (DEB-1046113), and the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program (to RWM).

Here, we hypothesized that leaf anatomical traits were closely related to gross primary productivity (GPP) because photosynthesis commonly occurs in the chloroplasts of palisade and spongy tissues in leaf. Eight leaf anatomical traits were measured in 916 plant species inhabiting from tropical to cold-temperate forests in eastern China: adaxial epidermis thickness (AD), abaxial epidermis thickness (AB), leaf thickness (LT), palisade tissue thickness (PT), and spongy tissue thickness (ST), palisade-spongy tissue ratio (PT/ST), palisade tissue-leaf thickness ratio (PT/LT), and spongy tissue-leaf thickness ratio (ST/LT). Leaf anatomical traits showed significant latitudinal patterns at species, plant functional group (PFG), and community levels (p<.05), and they differed between PFG and community. Temperature and precipitation were the main factors influencing AD, AB, PT/ST, and PT/LT, explaining 33-72% of the total variation at large scale. Furthermore, AB, LT, PT/ST, and PT/LT were significantly correlated with the aridity index. Our findings filled the data gap of plant anatomical traits at regional scales, and broadened current knowledge on the adaptation strategies of plant anatomical traits, which also provided new evidence for linkages of plant traits and functioning across natural communities.

Recent investigations suggest that the functional structure of communities, i.e. the composition and diversity of functional traits, is the main driver of ecological processes. However, the predictive power of BEF research is still low, the integration of all components of functional community structure as predictors is still lacking, and the multifunctionality of ecosystems (i.e. rates of multiple processes) must be considered. Here, using a multiple-processes framework from grassland biodiversity experiments, we show that functional identity of species and functional divergence among species, rather than species diversity per se, together promote the level of ecosystem multifunctionality with a predictive power of 80%. Our results suggest that primary productivity and decomposition rates, two key ecosystem processes upon which the global carbon cycle depends, are primarily sustained by specialist species, i.e. those that hold specialized combinations of traits and perform particular functions. Contrary to studies focusing on single ecosystem functions and considering species richness as the sole measure of biodiversity, we found a linear and non-saturating effect of the functional structure of communities on ecosystem multifunctionality. Thus, sustaining multiple ecological processes would require focusing on trait dominance and on the degree of community specialization, even in species-rich assemblages.","[Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Ecol Syst Marins Cotiers, UMR 5119, Montpellier, France; [Villeger, Sebastien] Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, UMR 5174, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Mason, Norman W.

We found that stand structural attributes are dominant predictors for forest biomass and productivity, while diversity is predominant in affecting biomass and productivity stability at all grain sizes (0.04 hm(2)similar to 0.12 hm(2)). Moreover, functional diversity seemed to be more important for biomass, productivity and their stability than taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and richness was more important than the other two diversity components (evenness and divergence). Our results reconcile the recent debate on the relative importance of diversity vs. stand factors on ecosystem properties, and suggest that forest management to adjust stand structure is an effective way to increase forest carbon storage rapidly, but biodiversity conservation may be crucial for ecosystem stability under climate change.","[Guo, Zhiwen; Wang, Xiangping; Fan, Dayong] Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Wang, XP (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangxiangping@bjfu.edu.cn,"Guo, Zhiwen/HHN-8179-2022","fan, dayong/0000-0002-2591-6029","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502104, 2017YFC0503901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870430]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502104, 2017YFC0503901), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870430).",NA,85,5,8,37,91,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Plant functional traits which reflect the physiological and ecological processes of plants in particular ecosystems are crucial for indicating the variations in the ecosystem structure and function. To better understand the adaptation strategies of plants to hydrological changes and provide a scientific basis for the selection of species in the re-vegetation of the newly formed ecosystems, 14 leaf functional traits and leaf economics spectrum (LES) of 19 dominant plants under different hydrological conditions were investigated in the water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The results showed that anti-seasonal flooding has significant effects on the leaf functional traits of plants (P < 0.05). The net photosynthetic rate of annual plants was significantly higher than that of perennial plants (P < 0.05), and there was a significant correlation between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits (P < 0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that soil water content and available phosphorus were the main factors affecting the leaf function of dominant species, indicating that hydrologic factors were still important environmental factors affecting leaf functional traits of dominant species in the WLFZ. And annuals from the WLFZ have characteristics of thick leaves, high photosynthetic rate, short lifespan, and high nutrient concentrations, which make them close to the fast investment-return end of LES. On the contrary, perennials are close to the slow investment-return end of LES. The high productivity investment of annuals is better than the high defense investment of perennials for adapting to the special habitats in the WLFZ. These results indicated that different functional plants in the WLFZ of the TGR under different hydrological regimes can adopt different strategies by weighing the associations and trade-offs between their economic traits.","[Li, Xiaoling; He, Di; Chen, Gong; Yang, Jin; Yang, Zhengjian; Guo, Xiao juan; Wang, Congfeng; Zhu, Shijiang; Huang, Yingping; Chen, Hongfeng] China Three Gorges Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Ctr Ecol Conservat & Manag, Minist Educ, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaoling; He, Di; Chen, Gong] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Biol & Pharmaceut Sci, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guiyun; Zhang, Dingjun] Three Gorges Corp, Rare Plants Res Inst Yangtze River, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Ye, Chen] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Peoples R China","China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS","Yang, ZJ (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Ctr Ecol Conservat & Manag, Minist Educ, Yichang, Peoples R China.;Huang, GY (corresponding author), Three Gorges Corp, Rare Plants Res Inst Yangtze River, Yichang, Peoples R China.",yangzj1984@ctgu.edu.cn; huang_guiyun@ctg.com.cn,"zhu, shijiang/E-1772-2013","Yang, Zhengjian/0009-0002-5905-7864","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779127, 51209122]; National 111 Intellectual Base [D20015]; Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education [KF2018-02]; Open Project fund of Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [E0520204]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019334]; Research Project on Seed Preservation Technology and Facilities of Rare Plants in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area-Investigation and Collection of Flooding-Tolerant Germplasm Resources [SDHZ2021346]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National 111 Intellectual Base; Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education; Open Project fund of Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Project on Seed Preservation Technology and Facilities of Rare Plants in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area-Investigation and Collection of Flooding-Tolerant Germplasm Resources","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51779127 and 51209122), partially funded by National 111 Intellectual Base (D20015), the Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education (No. KF2018-02).

This study aimed to assess the effects of termite mounds on the diversity of plant functional types (PFTs) and herbaceous' net aboveground primary productivity (NAPP) in plant communities (PCs) of the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve. PCs were identified through canonical correspondence analysis performed on 96 phytosociological releves' realized in plots of 900m(2). PFTs' diversity was compared between savannahs and mounds' plots using generalized linear models. In each plot, 7m(2) subplots were harvested and NAPP was determined. Linear mixed models were performed to assess change in herbaceous NAPP regarding species richness, graminoids' richness, specific leaf area and termite mounds. There is no specific plant community related to mounds. However, the occurrence of termite mounds induced an increase of woody and forbs diversity while the diversity of legumes and graminoids decreased. These diversity patterns led to decreasing of PCs' NAPP. This study confirms that termite-induced resource heterogeneity supports niche differentiation theory and increased savannah encroachment by woody species.","[Gbeffe, Alain K.; Houehanou, Thierry D.; Assede, Emeline S.

There are few robust tools available to link these processes, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long-term forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology. However, their relevance to tackle questions about the links between species composition, climate and forest functioning is unclear. In this regard, demonstrating the ability of gap models to predict the growth of forest stands at the annual parameterization scale resolution-representing a sensitive and integrated signal of tree functioning and mortality risk-appears as a fundamental step. In this study, we aimed at assessing the ability of a gap model to accurately predict forest growth in the short term and potential community composition in the long term, across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. To do so, we present the gap model ForCEEPS, calibrated using an original parameterization procedure for the main tree species in France. ForCEEPS was shown to satisfactorily predict forest annual growth (averaged over a few years) at the plot level from mountain to Mediterranean climates, regardless of the species. Such an accuracy was not gained at the cost of losing precision for long-term predictions, as the model showed a strong ability to predict potential community compositions. The mechanistic relevance of ForCEEPS parameterization was explored by showing the congruence between the values of key model parameter and species functional traits. We further showed that accounting for the spatial configuration of crowns within forest stands, the effects of climatic constraints and the variability of shade tolerances in the species community are all crucial to better predict short-term productivity with gap models. Synthesis. The dual ability of predicting short-term functioning and long-term community composition, as well as the balance between generality and realism (i.e. predicting accuracy) of the new generation of gap models may open great perspectives for the exploration of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, species coexistence mechanisms and the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems.

Understanding associations between shrub ecophysiological function, distribution and environment is necessary for predicting consequences of expansion. We evaluated the role of topographic gradients on upland shrub productivity to understand potential constraints on shrub expansion. At a low arctic tundra site near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, we measured sap flow, stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits in green alder, and environmental predictors (water and nutrient availability and seasonal thaw depth) across a toposequence in alder patches. Seasonal thaw reduced stem sap flow whereas topographic position predicted stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits. Upslope shrubs were more water-limited than those downslope. Shrubs in drainage channels had traits associated with greater productivity than those on the tops of slopes. The effect of thaw depth on sap flow has implications for seasonal water-use patterns and warming impacts on tundra ecohydrology. Topographic variation in functional traits corresponds with observed spatial patterns of tundra shrub expansion along floodplains and concave hillslopes rather than in upland areas.

There is extensive experimental evidence for the importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem functioning. However, such experiments typically prevent immigration by continuously removing non-target species, thereby questioning the generality of these findings to real-world ecosystems. This is particularly true in forest ecosystems where understorey herbaceous species are key biodiversity components but are usually weeded in tree diversity experiments. Consequently, little is known about how tree diversity influences the natural dynamics of understorey herbaceous layers. 2. We conducted a 3-year non-weeded tree diversity experiment composed of eight woody species differing widely in plant economic strategies. We examined how the functional diversity and identity of tree species mixtures drive the temporal dynamics of understorey productivity, functional diversity and composition through canopy packing (CP). 3. Tree mixtures with high functional diversity experienced increased CP over time, thereby decreasing understorey productivity and diversity. Furthermore, herbaceous communities were dominated by species with functional traits typical of low-light conditions [lower community-weighted mean (CWM) of maximum plant height, but larger CWM of specific leaf area] in response to increased CP. 4. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of tree functional diversity in shaping the dynamics of biomass, functional diversity and composition of the understorey herbaceous layer during the early successional period. It is expected that the effects of tree functional diversity would also be relevant over time due to the increasing usage of canopy space. This study highlights the significance of natural community processes in determining the effects of tree diversity on the temporal dynamics of previously neglected ecosystem structures and functioning.","[Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] Inst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

However, its relative role compared with stand factors or functional identity is still controversial in natural forests. Here, we examined their relative effects on biomass and productivity during forest restoration. We investigated stand biomass and productivity for 24 plots (600 m(2)) across restoration stages in the subtropical forests of Mt. Shennongjia, Central China. We measured five key functional traits and calculated functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and dispersion) and community-weighted mean of traits. We used general linear models, variation partitioning methods to test the relative importance of stand factors (density, stand age, maximum height, etc.), functional identity, species and functional diversity on biomass and productivity. Our results illustrated that stand biomass and productivity increased significantly as forest restoration, and that community species richness increased, while functional dispersion decreased significantly. Variation partitioning analyses showed that diversity had no significant pure effects on biomass and productivity. However, diversity may affect biomass and productivity through the joint effect with stand factors and functional identity. Overall, we found that stand factors had the strongest effect on biomass and productivity, while functional identity significantly affects productivity but not biomass, suggesting that modulating stand structure and species identity are effective ways to enhance forest carbon storage and sequestrations potential in forest management.","[Miao, Wenhao; Ma, Shupeng; Guo, Zhiwen; Sun, Haozhe; Wang, Xuemei; Lyu, Yueming; Wang, Xiangping] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Wang, XP (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wangxiangping@bjfu.edu.cn,"Sun, Haozhe/GPF-8964-2022; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Wang, Xuemei/GXF-3702-2021","Sun, Haozhe/0000-0002-3625-2870; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870430]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0503901, 2016YFC0502104]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870430) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0503901, 2016YFC0502104).",NA,74,6,6,10,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9920,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

The aim of this study was to analyze the relation between vegetation production and soil C stocks for a set of seven temperate grasslands of various productivity levels. We estimated vegetation production directly through measurements of aboveground biomass (>5 cm), stubble and root biomass, and indirectly via plant community functioning. Soil C stocks were measured for bulk soil (organic C, SOC) and hot-water-extractable C (HWC) of topsoil. Plant community functioning was characterized by community-weighted mean ((CWM)) traits and functional diversity index. Results show a negative relation between biomass production and SOC(stock.)The tradeoff between productivity and SOC(stock)could be linked to plant community functioning and particularly Leaf Dry Matter content (LDMCCWM) which appeared to be the most relevant descriptor of plant community functioning. High SOC(stock)could be associated to low productivity, conservative strategy (high LDMCCWM), low soil labile C content and grassland age. Our results show a strong direct effect of management and grassland age on plant community, which in turn affects plant tissue quality and subsequent organic matter mineralization. Old permanent grasslands appeared less productive but represent an occasion for C storage and thus global change mitigation.","[Kohler, Caroline; Morvan-Bertrand, Annette; Cliquet, Jean-Bernard; Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Inst Biol Fondamentale & Appl IBFA, INRAE,EVA,Fed Normandie Vegetale 4277, F-14000 Caen, France; [Klumpp, Katja] UCA, INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",INRAE; Universite de Caen Normandie; INRAE; VetAgro Sup,"Lemauviel-Lavenant, S (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Inst Biol Fondamentale & Appl IBFA, INRAE,EVA,Fed Normandie Vegetale 4277, F-14000 Caen, France.",caroline@kohler.bio; annette.bertrand@unicaen.fr; jean-bernard.cliquet@unicaen.fr; katja.klumpp@inra.fr; servane.lavenant@unicaen.fr,"Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane/AHE-2202-2021","Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane/0000-0003-0176-6318; Morvan-Bertrand, Annette/0000-0002-7802-6943; Katja, Klumpp/0000-0002-4799-5230",Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie,Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie(Region Normandie),This work was supported by the Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie.,NA,75,4,4,5,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4394,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUL,2020,10,7,,NA,,NA,,,1024,10.3390/agronomy10071023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071023,NA,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,MW7AP,NA,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/4/2023,WOS:000557185000000,View Full Record in Web of Science,Davi,sim,,sim,,não,grassland,temperate,negativa,1;2,SLA;LDMC;LCC;LNC;LC:N,NA,NA,ns,positiva,NA,ns,negativa ,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,negativa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,ns,,,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant communities in natural ecosystems are changing and species are being lost due to anthropogenic impacts including global warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. We removed dominant species, combinations of species and entire functional types from Alaskan tussock tundra, in the presence and absence of fertilization, to examine the effects of non-random species loss on plant interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. After 6 years, growth of remaining species had compensated for biomass loss due to removal in all treatments except the combined removal of moss, Betula nana and Ledum palustre (MBL), which removed the most biomass. Total vascular plant production returned to control levels in all removal treatments, including MBL. Inorganic soil nutrient availability, as indexed by resins, returned to control levels in all unfertilized removal treatments, except MBL. 3. Although biomass compensation occurred, the species that provided most of the compensating biomass in any given treatment were not from the same functional type (growth form) as the removed species. This provides empirical evidence that functional types based on effect traits are not the same as functional types based on response to perturbation. Calculations based on redistributing N from the removed species to the remaining species suggested that dominant species from other functional types contributed most of the compensatory biomass. 4. Fertilization did not increase total plant community biomass, because increases in graminoid and deciduous shrub biomass were offset by decreases in evergreen shrub, moss and lichen biomass. Fertilization greatly increased inorganic soil nutrient availability. 5. In fertilized removal treatments, deciduous shrubs and graminoids grew more than expected based on their performance in the fertilized intact community, while evergreen shrubs, mosses and lichens all grew less than expected. Deciduous shrubs performed better than graminoids when B. nana was present, but not when it had been removed. 6. Synthesis. Terrestrial ecosystem response to warmer temperatures and greater nutrient availability in the Arctic may result in vegetative stable-states dominated by either deciduous shrubs or graminoids. The current relative abundance of these dominant growth forms may serve as a predictor for future vegetation composition.","[Bret-Harte, M. Syndonia; Sloan, Daniel B.; Chapin, F.

How the evolution of such strategies modifies ecosystem functioning and services is still not well understood. In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter, and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman's R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur) and impact the evolutionary resilience (i.e., the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in the face of external disturbances. We show that changes in plant biomass and their effects on evolutionary change can be understood by accounting for the links between nutrient uptake and mineralization, and for indirect effects of nutrient uptake on the amount of detritus in the system.","[Loeuille, Nicolas; Le Mao, Tiphaine; Barot, Sebastien] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS,IRD,INRA,Inst Ecol & Environm Sci,UMR7618, 7 Quai St Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Loeuille, N (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS,IRD,INRA,Inst Ecol & Environm Sci,UMR7618, 7 Quai St Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.",nicolas.loeuille@upmc.fr,"barot, sébastien/A-8447-2012","barot, sébastien/0000-0002-5910-538X",French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA); CNRS; IRD,French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); IRD,The authors are very grateful to Dominique Gravel and Nicolas Gross for their helpful and constructive comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

This needs to be balanced with their potential negative impact on crop yield and quality. Mechanistic models of crop-weed competition are an important tool in striking this balance. A range of common UK annual weeds were screened for the eco-physiological traits required by the models. Using multivariate techniques, a number of functional groups with a similar pattern of productivity and competition were identified, based on trade-offs between traits. A scheme was developed to assign species outside of the data set to one of the groups, based on life cycle, seed mass, maximum height and time of first flowering. As well as having a similar competitive ability, species within a group also appeared to have a similar ecosystem function, in terms of supporting higher trophic groups. Two beneficial groups of species were identified that combined a relatively low competitive ability with a high importance for invertebrates and birds. The identification of functional groups in the UK arable flora is a useful tool for assessing a weed community in the context of reconciling biodiversity provision with crop production.

Many studies have shown that a greater plant diversity can stabilize community productivity against environmental fluctuations. However, most of these studies focused on plant species richness, thus overlooking the potential role of functional traits in stabilizing community productivity against environmental fluctuations. Whether and how functional trait mean and variability influence community stability in response to environmental changes and their relative contributions to community stability are largely unknown. Here, we used a 10-year experiment to investigate the role of species richness, as well as functional mean and intra- and interspecific variability of specific leaf area (SLA) of plants within- and among communities in driving community stability in response to nitrogen (N) addition and warming. We found that both N addition and warming reduced the temporal stability of community productivity by reducing species richness and its contribution to species asynchrony and species stability. In contrast, changes in the mean and variability of SLA in response to N addition and warming mitigated the reduction of community stability. Specifically, N addition reduced variation in SLA both by reducing interspecific differences in SLA within communities and differences in mean values of SLA among communities. Warming increased intraspecific differences in SLA among communities, leading to higher species stability that partly buffered the reduction of community stability. Our study demonstrates the role of trait mean and variability in mitigating the reduction of community stability in response to two pervasive global environmental changes. Gaining a deeper understanding of the processes linking global changes and the stability of our ecosystems requires integrating both trait mean values and trait variability.","[Huang, Mengjiao; Nie, Ming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Sci, Natl Observat & Res Stn Shanghai Yangtze Estuarin, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Mengjiao; Nie, Ming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shurong] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestr, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Fudan University; Fudan University; Peking University; Peking University; Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Hainan University; Utrecht University,"Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestr, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017; Nie, Ming/F-1880-2010; Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012","Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Nie, Ming/0000-0003-0702-8009; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31830009, 31770518]; Hainan University [RZ2000009932]; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31830009 and 31770518 to SZ) and and Hainan University (RZ2000009932 to SZ).

However, it remains unclear how multi-resource enrichment induces the effects of multifaceted biodiversity on grassland productivity under different site resource constraints. We conducted a multiple resource addition (MRA) ex-periment of water and nutrients at three sites located along a resource gradient in northern China. This allowed us to assess the response of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species (species richness and plant density), functional (functional richness and community-weighted mean of traits) and phylogenetic (phylogenetic richness) diversity to increasing number of MRA. We used structural equation model (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect effects of MRA and multifaceted biodiversity on ANPP. The combined addition of the four resources increased ANPP at all three sites. But with increasing number of MRA, biodiversity varied at the three sites. At the high resource constraint site, species richness, plant density and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) increased. At the medium resource con-straint site, plant height and LNC increased, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) decreased. At the low resource constraint site, species, functional and phylogenetic richness decreased, and height increased. The SEM showed that MRA in-creased ANPP directly at all three sites, and indirectly by increasing plant density at the high constraint site and height at the medium constraint site. Independent of MRA, ANPP was affected by height at the high resource constraint site and LNC at the low resource constraint site. Our results illustrate that multi-resource addition positively affects produc-tivity, while affects biodiversity depending on site resource constraint. The study highlights that site resource con-straint conditions need to be taken into consideration to better predict grassland structure and function, particularly under the future multifaceted global change scenarios.","[Guo, Xinxin; Zuo, Xiaoan; Guo, Aixia; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Qiao, Jingjuan; Li, Xiangyun; Chen, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinxin; Qiao, Jingjuan; Li, Xiangyun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Zhao, Xueyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Chen, Min] Key Lab Stress Physiol & Ecol Cold & Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; Natl Res Council IBE NRC, Inst BioEcon, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Wei, Cunzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tian; Ke, Yuguang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Grassland Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Beijing Forestry University","Zuo, XA (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",guoxinxin@lzb.ac.cn; zuoxa@lzb.ac.cn; yueping@lzb.ac.cn; zhaoxy@lzb.ac.cn; lixiangyun19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; weicunzheng@ibcas.ac.cn; yuq@bjfu.edu.cn,"Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011","Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623; Wei, Cunzheng/0000-0001-9309-2722",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071140]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program [2019QZKK0305]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [E229880105]; Light of West China program CAS [E129050301],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Light of West China program CAS,"This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071140) , Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Re-search program (2019QZKK0305) , Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (E229880105) and Light of West China program CAS (E129050301) .",NA,65,0,0,64,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

As the need for biodiversity assessments increases in the face of accelerated global change, novel approaches that are rapid, repeatable and scalable are critical, especially in ecosystems for which information about species identity and the number of species is difficult to acquire. Here, we present 'spectral diversity'-a spectroscopic index of the variability of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants measured in the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions (400-2,400 nm). Using data collected from the Cedar Creek biodiversity experiment (Minnesota, USA), we provide evidence that the dissimilarity of species' leaf spectra increases with functional dissimilarity and evolutionary divergence time. Spectral diversity at the leaf level explains 51% of total variation in productivity-a proportion comparable to taxonomic (47%), functional (51%) or phylogenetic diversity (48%)-and performs similarly when calculated from high-resolution canopy image spectra. Spectral diversity is an emerging dimension of plant biodiversity that integrates trait variation within and across species even in the absence of taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic or abundance information, and has the potential to transform biodiversity assessment because of its scalability to remote sensing.","[Schweiger, Anna K.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Hobbie, Sarah E.; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Madritch, Michael D.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Adv Land Management Informat Technol, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Alberta; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Alberta; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Schweiger, AK; Cavender-Bares, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",aschweig@umn.edu; cavender@umn.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008; Tilman, David/ABD-5309-2021; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Wang, Ran/AGM-2266-2022; Wang, Ran/AEM-8386-2022","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630; Schweiger, Anna Katharina/0000-0002-5567-4200","National Science Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Dimensions of Biodiversity programme [DEB-1342872, DEB-1342778, DEB-1342827, DEB-1342823]; Cedar Creek National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research programme [DEB-1234162]; iCORE/AITF [G224150012, 200700172]; NSERC [RGPIN-2015-05129]; CFI [26793]; China Scholarship Council; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1342778] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Dimensions of Biodiversity programme; Cedar Creek National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research programme; iCORE/AITF; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); CFI(Canada Foundation for Innovation); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We acknowledge B.

In terrestrial systems, aboveground and belowground vegetation quantity and quality are coupled, and both influence belowground microbial processes and nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that ecosystem productivity, and the chemical, structural and phylogenetic-functional composition of plant communities would be detectable with remote sensing and could be used to predict belowground plant and soil processes in two grassland biodiversity experiments: the BioDIV experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota and the Wood River Nature Conservancy experiment in Nebraska. We tested whether aboveground vegetation chemistry and productivity, as detected from airborne sensors, predict soil properties, microbial processes and community composition. Imaging spectroscopy data were used to map aboveground biomass, green vegetation cover, functional traits and phylogenetic-functional community composition of vegetation. We examined the relationships between the image-derived variables and soil carbon and nitrogen concentration, microbial community composition, biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, and soil processes, including net nitrogen mineralization. In the BioDIV experiment-which has low overall diversity and productivity despite high variation in each-belowground processes were driven mainly by variation in the amount of organic matter inputs to soils. As a consequence, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity, and fungal and bacterial composition and diversity were significantly predicted by remotely sensed vegetation cover and biomass. In contrast, at Wood River-where plant diversity and productivity were consistently higher-belowground processes were driven mainly by variation in the quality of aboveground inputs to soils. Consequently, remotely sensed functional, chemical and phylogenetic composition of vegetation predicted belowground extracellular enzyme activity, microbial biomass, and net nitrogen mineralization rates but aboveground biomass (or cover) did not. The contrasting associations between the quantity (productivity) and quality (composition) of aboveground inputs with belowground soil attributes provide a basis for using imaging spectroscopy to understand belowground processes across productivity gradients in grassland systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how above and belowground components interact among different ecosystems remains critical to extending these results broadly.","[Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Schweiger, Anna K.; Helzer, Kimberly; Lapadat, Cathleen; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schweiger, Anna K.] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Schweiger, Anna K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gamon, John A.; Gholizadeh, Hamed] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB AB T6G, Canada; [Gholizadeh, Hamed] Oklahoma State Univ, Ctr Applicat Remote Sensing, Dept Geog, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Madritch, Michael D.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.; Wang, Zhihui] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universite de Montreal; University of Zurich; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Alberta; University of Alberta; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Cavender-Bares, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",cavender@umn.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008; wang, zhihui/HSF-6639-2023; gholizadeh, hamed/HRE-1528-2023; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Gamon, John/A-2641-2014","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723; Schweiger, Anna Katharina/0000-0002-5567-4200; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630; Gholizadeh, Hamed/0000-0002-4770-7893",NSF/NASA [DEB-1342872]; NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND [DBI: 2021898]; Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF [DEB 1831944]; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich,NSF/NASA(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND; Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich,"The project was funded by NSF/NASA DEB-1342872; the NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND, DBI: 2021898; and the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF DEB 1831944.

Studies have shown that productivity would change following fertilization in the grassland. The response of productivity to fertilization mainly depends on the dominant species traits. Trait-based methods provide a useful tool for explaining the variations in grassland productivity following fertilization. However, the relative contribution of plant functional traits to grassland productivity under N and P addition in the Loess Plateau is not clear. We measured aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf N content (LN), leaf P content (LP), leaf N/P ratio (LN/P), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf tissue density (LTD), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and maximum plant height (H-max) to study how these plant functional traits regulate the relative biomass of different species and grassland productivity following fertilization. Our results showed, that under different nutrient addition levels, the linkages between plant functional traits and the relative biomass of different species were different. Community AGB was positively related to community-weighted mean LN (CWM_LN), CWM_LN/P, CWM_SLA, and CWM_H-max, but negatively related to CWM_LTD and CWM_LDMC.

We expected an increase in most EFs in communities with higher values of FD and/or PD via complementarity effects, but also the dominant plant types (using community weighted mean, CWM, independent of FD and PD) via selection effects on several EFs. The results showed strong direct effects of different dimensions of plant functional structure parameters on plant-related EFs, through either CWM or FD, with weak effects of PD. Fertilization had significant effects on one soil microbial activity and indirect effects on the other variables via changes in soil abiotic properties.

The quantity and quality of these inputs is determined by the identity of the plants involved. Yet substantial uncertainty surrounds the complex relationships among plant traits and soil C, precluding efforts to maximize whole-ecosystem C uptake in nature-based climate mitigation scenarios. In this study, we leveraged a biodiversity-ecosystem function experiment with trees (IDENT) to explore the effects of interspecific variation in plant traits on soil C dynamics in the very early stages of stand development (9 years since planting). Mineral soil C stocks to 5 cm depth were quantified in monospecific plots of 19 tree species planted on a former agricultural field, and analyzed in relation to tree growth and functional traits. We found that tree species identity affected soil bulk density and, to a lesser extent, the carbon content of the topsoil, and thereby total C pools. Among species and across plots, mineral soil C stocks were positively correlated with rates of tree growth and were significantly larger beneath broadleaf trees with fast functional traits vs. conifers with more conservative leaf traits, when comparisons were made over equivalent soil depth increments. Thus, plant functional traits mediate interspecific differences in productivity, which in turn influence the magnitude of belowground C stocks. These results highlight important linkages between above- and belowground carbon cycles in the earliest stages of afforestation.","[Waring, Bonnie G.; Smith, Kenneth R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Waring, Bonnie G.; Smith, Kenneth R.] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Belluau, Michael; Khlifa, Rim; Messier, Christian; Paquette, Alain] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Temperate Forest Sci, Ctr Forest Res CEF, Dept Nat Resources, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Munson, Alison] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Waring, Bonnie G.] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Life Sci, London, England",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Natural Resources Canada; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Laval University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London,"Waring, BG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Waring, BG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Waring, BG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Life Sci, London, England.",bonnie.waring@gmail.com,,,,,,NA,55,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

Between-species variation in nutrient resorption is one of the mechanisms explaining the positive relationship between biodiversity and primary productivity. Yet, the role of within-species variations in nutrient resorption in mediating the relationship between biodiversity and productivity remains unclear. 2. We examined how within-species nutrient resorption, and ultimately productivity, respond to changes in species richness by using four traits related to nitrogen and phosphorus use in four dominant species from different plant functional groups in a biodiversity removal experiment in the temperate steppe. 3. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in both green and senesced leaves in all species significantly decreased with increasing plant species richness, suggesting that plants used those limiting nutrients more efficiently with increasing biodiversity. Plants in higher diversity communities resorbed more nutrients during senescence, which may facilitate reproduction and vegetative regrowth in the next year. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of considering within-species variation in nutrient resorption as an important underlying mechanism explaining the positive effects of biodiversity on primary productivity and ecosystem carbon accumulation.","[Lu, Xiao-Tao; Hu, Yan-Yu; Han, Xing-Guo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yan-Yu; Han, Xing-Guo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wolf, Amelia A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Han, Xing-Guo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Lu, XT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",lvxiaotao@iae.ac.cn,"Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016","Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31822006, 31770503]; National Basic Research Program of China [2016YFC0500601, 2015CB150802]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010403, XDA23070103]; CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC006]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2014174]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31822006 and 31770503; National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500601 and 2015CB150802; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB15010403 and XDA23070103; Key Research Program from CAS, Grant/Award Number: QYZDB-SSW-DQC006; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS,Grant/Award Number: 2014174",NA,28,25,28,11,195,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Yet, most of studies of leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl) have typically been limited to few species or sites, and there has been little understanding of its variation among species of contrasting environments, or across forests differing in gross primary productivity (GPP). We measured mass-based foliar Chl concentrations (Chl a, Chl b, and total Chl) for 937 species of nine Chinese forests ranging from tropical to cold-temperate regions. Total Chl varied by over ten-fold from 1.45 to 19.2 mg g(-1) (mean: 5.54 mg g(-1)), and differed among plant functional groups. At the community level, total Chl decreased with increasing latitude. The ratio of Chl a/b decreased from trees to shrubs to herbs, consistent with adaptation to contrasting irradiance, i.e., overstory vs. understory. Total Chl was positively related to leaf N and P concentrations, as would be expected to optimize photosynthesis and carbon fixation. Across forests, GPP was positively correlated with community-averaged Chl (r = 0.57; P < 0.01), a new case of a linkage between leaf traits and ecosystem function at regional to continental scale. Our findings revealed variation in Chl from tropical to cold-temperate forests, and the linkage of leaf Chl with ecosystem function, enhancing our ability to parameterize vegetation models.","[Li, Ying; Wu, Xiuqin; Hou, Jihua] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; Yang, Hao; Xu, Li; Wang, Qiufeng; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; Yang, Hao; Xu, Li; Wang, Qiufeng; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sack, Lawren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Northeast Normal University - China","Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",houjihua@bjfu.edu.cn,"wang, qiufeng/C-1654-2013; Sack, Lawren/A-5492-2008","Sack, Lawren/0000-0002-7009-7202","Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC0504004, 2016YFC0500202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31000263, 611606015, 31290221]; STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFJ-SW-STS-167]; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project [LENOM2016Q0005]",Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project,"This work was supported by the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2017YFC0504004, 2016YFC0500202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31000263, 611606015, 31290221), STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KFJ-SW-STS-167), and the program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project (LENOM2016Q0005).",NA,48,42,51,6,67,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Current theoretical approaches to modeling ecosystem response to environmental change often deal only with single environmental drivers or single species traits, simple ecological interactions, and/or steady states, leading to concern about how accurately these approaches will capture future responses to environmental change in real biological systems. To begin addressing this issue, we generalize a previous trait-based framework to incorporate aspects of frequency dependence, functional complementarity, and the dynamics of systems composed of species that are defined by multiple traits that are tied to multiple environmental drivers. The framework is particularly well suited for analyzing the role of temporal environmental fluctuations in maintaining trait variability and the resultant effects on community response to environmental change. Using this framework, we construct simple models to investigate two ecological problems. First, we show how complementary resource use can significantly enhance the nutrient uptake of plant communities through two different mechanisms related to increased productivity (over-yielding) and larger trait variability. Over-yielding is a hallmark of complementarity and increases the total biomass of the community and, thus, the total rate at which nutrients are consumed. Trait variability also increases due to the lower levels of competition associated with complementarity, thus speeding up the rate at which more efficient species emerge as conditions change. Second, we study systems in which multiple environmental drivers act on species defined by multiple, correlated traits. We show that correlations in these systems can increase trait variability within the community and again lead to faster responses to environmental change. The methodological advances provided here will apply to almost any function that relates species traits and environmental drivers to growth, and should prove useful for studying the effects of climate change on the dynamics of biota.

Diversity effects included both complementarity and selection mechanisms, measured respectively through functional diversity and functional identity measures. ResultsDiversity had a significant effect on both carbon storage and tree productivity, even when controlling for confounding factors of climate and stand structure. A consistent positive effect of functional diversity on carbon storage and tree productivity was observed in all seven forest types studied. This relationship was not linear, and the largest changes in carbon storage and tree productivity were observed at low levels of functional diversity. However, the importance of complementarity effects was not consistent with the productivity of different forest types. Selection effects were particularly important in deciduous and Mediterranean pine forests, but had very little effect on mountain pines. Main conclusionsWe found a generally positive effect of diversity on carbon storage and tree productivity, supported by both complementarity and selection mechanisms. Thus, both functionally diverse forests and functionally important species should be maintained to adequately preserve and promote key ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and tree productivity.","[Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] CIFOR INIA, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena] CSIC, IRNAS, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad de Alcala; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS); Max Planck Society,"Ruiz-Benito, P (autor correspondente), Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Sci Bldg,Campus Univ, Madrid 28871, Spain.",palomaruizbenito@gmail.com,"Gómez-Aparicio, Lorena/K-6905-2014; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012; Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016","Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469","FUNDIV [ENV.2010.2.1.4-1]; FPU fellowship [AP2008-01325]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its programme QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System); French Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe' France;  [INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03];  [SUM2008-00004-C03-01]","FUNDIV; FPU fellowship(Spanish Government); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its programme QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); French Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe' France; ; ","This research was initially supported by INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03 and SUM2008-00004-C03-01 projects, and by FUNDIV (ENV.2010.2.1.4-1) at a later stage.

Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.","[Spasojevic, Marko J.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Spasojevic, Marko J.] Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Bahlai, Christie A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48915 USA; [Bahlai, Christie A.] Michigan State Univ, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, E Lansing, MI 48915 USA; [Bradley, Bethany A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Tuanmu, Mao-Ning] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sistla, Seeta] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Wiederholt, Ruscena] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Michigan State University; Michigan State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; Yale University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Spasojevic, MJ (autor correspondente), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Spasojevic, MJ (autor correspondente), Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mspaso@gmail.com,"Bahlai, Christie/L-5500-2019; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017; Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008; Tuanmu, Mao-Ning/ABI-5979-2020; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020","Bahlai, Christie/0000-0002-8937-8709; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971; Tuanmu, Mao-Ning/0000-0002-8233-2935; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048",,,,NA,90,32,32,5,153,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Long-term productivity stability in plant communities is often associated with greater species, phylogenetic or functional diversity, more complex size and age structures, or higher asynchrony in species fluctuations (compensatory dynamics), all potentially increasing community resistance to perturbations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways is still poorly understood, especially in old-growth species-rich forests. Here we explore how compensatory dynamics and multiple facets of diversity underpin temporal stability of wood biomass production over forty years in a Japanese temperate forest, based on more than 45 500 stem increments from 15 species. Whereas the effect of species richness and phylogenetic diversity was small, the old-growth structural attributes markedly increased community stability via increased asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Greater standing tree volume, stem density and interspecific variation in growth rates enhanced productivity stability both directly and indirectly via increased asynchrony. This corroborates the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Asymmetric competition in old-growth patches, between dominant oaks and sub-canopy shade-tolerant firs and maples, is a major driver of productivity stability over time via compensatory dynamics. Overall productivity remains relatively constant in old-growth patches, as abundant firs and maples in the lower canopy layers compensate for biomass losses in canopy oaks caused by aging, wind and snow disturbances. Younger forest patches, composed of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species, had a lower stability of productivity, with reduced stem basal area and tree density due to higher understory bamboo coverage preventing tree regeneration and growth. We provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the stability of ecosystem functioning in diverse forest ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of preserving and supporting old-growth forests and their structural complexity.","[Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Uemura, Shigeru] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Forest Res Stn, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan; [Takahashi, Koichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Hara, Toshihiko] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Hokkaido University; Shinshu University; Hokkaido University,"Dolezal, J (autor correspondente), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.;Dolezal, J (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",jiriddolezal@gmail.com,"Fibich, Pavel/B-3013-2015; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Altman, Jan/B-4305-2015","Fibich, Pavel/0000-0001-9066-3753; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation [17-19376S, 17-07378S, 20-05840Y]; Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences); Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","The study was funded by the Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University and by Czech Science Foundation (grants 17-19376S, 17-07378S and 20-05840Y), Czech Academy of Sciences (RVO 67985939) and Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship.",NA,65,16,16,20,124,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2020,129,11,,,,NA,1692,1703,,10.1111/oik.07379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.07379,NA,AUG 2020,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OM5SL,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000555270000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,Jean,sim,,sim,sim,não,forest,temperate,positive;ns-for-leaf-traits,1,age;height;relative-growth-rate;SLA;LDMC;LNC;LPC,,NA,positive,positive,NA,positive,,,NA,NA,positive,NA,NA,NA,NA,positive,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,podemos ter mais de uma resposta dependendo da metrica de diversidade funcional analisada

Although the understory accounts for the majority of plant diversity in forests, it remains unclear how understory aboveground biomass production (UABP) is influenced by its species diversity and community-level functional traits. Location Great Xing'an Mountains of ortheastern China. Methods We quantified the effects of species richness, community aggregated traits (community weighted mean trait values, CWM) and functional diversity (functional dispersion, FDis) on UABP using structural equation modeling (SEM), which simultaneously accounted for the effects of overstory tree basal area, stand age, and soil fertility. Results In the full model, species richness had a negative direct, a positive indirect and no total effect on UABP. Furthermore, CWM and FDis, respectively, exhibited positive and no effect on UABP. Among the covariates, soil fertility, stand age, and overstory tree basal area had, respectively, positive, negative, and no effect on UABP. In the model without species richness, all trait variables had similar effects on UABP to those in the full model. In the richness-only model without traits, species richness, soil fertility and stand age had no effect on UABP. Conclusions Our results suggest that the selection effect largely determined understory DPRs due to the stronger effects of CWM on UABP than of FDis. Soil fertility exhibited the strongest influence on understory DPRs due to its parallel influences on traits, diversity, and productivity. The increase in resource availability induced by overstory tree litter-fall likely promoted soil fertility as the main driver of the understory DPRs. Stand age exhibited a negative effect on UABP, which may have contributed to the increases in shrub dominance and decreases in production due to limited resources.","[Liu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo; Chen, Han Y.

Annual precipitation varied by greater than a factor of three over 11 years in central Texas, USA leading to large variation in production. Stability was greatest in communities that were not dominated by few species and in which dominant species rooted shallowly, had dense leaves, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in production. Stability may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits as on species richness alone. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) varies in response to temporal fluctuations in weather. Temporal stability of community ANPP may be increased by increasing plant species richness, but stability often varies at a given richness level implying a dependence on abundances and functional properties of member species. We measured stability in ANPP during 11 years in field plots (Texas, USA) in which we varied the richness and relative abundances of perennial grassland species at planting. We sought to identify species abundance patterns and functional traits linked to the acquisition and processing of essential resources that could be used to improve richness-based predictions of community stability. We postulated that community stability would correlate with abundance-weighted indices of traits that influence plant responses to environmental variation. Annual precipitation varied by a factor of three leading to large inter-annual variation in ANPP. Regression functions with planted and realized richness (species with > 1% of community ANPP during the final four years) explained 32% and 25% of the variance in stability, respectively. Regression models that included richness plus the fraction of community ANPP produced by the two most abundant species in combination with abundance-weighted values of either the fraction of sampled root biomass at 20-45 cm depth, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or response to greater-than-average precipitation of plants grown in monocultures explained 58-69% (planted richness) and 58-64% (realized richness) of the variance in stability. Stability was greatest in communities that were not strongly dominated by only two species and in which plants rooted shallowly, had high values of LDMC, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in ANPP. Our results indicate that the temporal stability of grassland ANPP may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits linked to plant responses to precipitation variability as on species richness alone.","[Polley, H.

The hypothesis that complementarity and selection effects drive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions is well accepted, and an approach to statistically untangle the relative importance of these effects has been widely applied. In contrast, empirical demonstrations of the biological mechanisms that underlie these relationships remain rare. Here, on the basis of a field experiment with young trees, we provide evidence that one form of complementarity in plant communities-complementarity among crowns in canopy space-is a mechanism, related to light interception and use, that links biodiversity with ecosystem productivity. Stem biomass overyielding increased sharply in mixtures with greater crown complementarity. Inherent differences among species in crown architecture led to greater crown complementarity in functionally diverse species mixtures. Intraspecific variation, specifically neighbourhood-driven plasticity in crowns, further modified spatial complementarity and strengthened the positive relationship with overyielding-crown plasticity and inherent interspecific differences contributed near equally in explaining patterns of overyielding.

However, whether tree diversity is able to increase the stability of forest growth to changes in climate is still an open question. We addressed this question using 36,378 permanent forest plots from National Forest Inventories of Spain and Qu,bec (Eastern Canada), covering five of the most important climate types where forests grow on Earth and a large temperature and precipitation gradient. The plots were used to compute forest productivity (aboveground woody biomass increment) and functional diversity (based on the functional traits of species). Divergence from normal levels of precipitation (dryer or wetter than 30-year means) and temperature (warmer or colder) were computed for each plot from monthly temperature and precipitation means. Other expected drivers of forest growth were also included. Our results show a significant impact of climate divergences on forest productivity, but not always in the expected direction. Furthermore, although functional trait diversity had a general positive impact on forest productivity under normal conditions, this effect was not maintained in stands having suffered from temperature divergence (i.e., warmer conditions). Contrary to our expectations, we found that tree diversity did not result in more stable forest's growth conditions during changes in climate. These results could have important implications for the future dynamics and management of mixed forests worldwide under climate change.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, CFR, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Vayreda, Jordi; Coll, Lluis; Retana, Javier] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Vayreda, Jordi; Coll, Lluis; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Coll, Lluis] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn EAGROF, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Coll, Lluis] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Messier, Christian] UQO, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat de Lleida; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); University of Quebec,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, CFR, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,"Coll, Lluís/E-8724-2015; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Vayreda, Jordi/U-8172-2017","Coll, Lluís/0000-0002-8035-5949; Vayreda, Jordi/0000-0002-9538-7361",NEWFORESTS program; project EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [AGL2015-629 70425-R]; NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth,"NEWFORESTS program; project EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth","This research was supported by the NEWFORESTS program, the project EST_RES (AGL2015-629 70425-R) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, and the NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth.

Ecosystem-scale water-use strategy is increasingly recognized as a key factor in regulating drought-related ecosystem responses. However, the link between water-use strategy and ecosystem vulnerability to meteorological droughts is poorly established. Using the global flux observations, historic hydroclimatic data, remote-sensing products, and plant functional-trait archive, we identified potentially vulnerable ecosystems, examining how ecosystem water-use strategy, quantified by the percentage bias (delta) of the empirical canopy conductance sensitivity to VPD relative to the theoretical value, mediated ecosystem responses to droughts. We found that prevailing soil water availability substantially impacted delta in dryland regions where ecosystems with insufficient soil moisture usually showed conservative water-use strategy, while ecosystems in humid regions exhibited more pronounced climatic adaptability. Hyposensitive and hypersensitive ecosystems, classified based on delta falling below or above the theoretical sensitivity, respectively, achieved similar net ecosystem productivity during droughts, employing different structural and functional strategies. However, hyposensitive ecosystems, risking their hydraulic system with a permissive water-use strategy, were unable to recover from droughts as quickly as hypersensitive ones. Our findings highlight that processed-based models predicting current functions and future performance of vegetation should account for the greater vulnerability of hyposensitive ecosystems to intensifying atmospheric and soil droughts.","[Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Comb, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Duke University; Duke University; University of Helsinki,"Zhang, ZQ (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Oren, R (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Oren, R (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",zhqzhang@bjfu.edu.cn; ramoren@duke.edu,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Xu, Hang/0000-0002-6661-3139",Academy of Finland [337549]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M710407]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2016VBA036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BLX202108]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF1302501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31872711],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 337549; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2022M710407; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative, Grant/Award Number: 2016VBA036; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: BLX202108; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2022YFF1302501; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31872711",NA,101,0,0,20,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, the relative importance of taxonomic diversity and functional characteristics (including functional dominance and functional diversity) in maintaining community productivity and the underlying mechanisms (including selection and complementarity effects) of the relationship between diversity and community productivity have been widely controversial. In this study, 194 sites were surveyed in five grassland types along a precipitation gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland of China. The relationships between taxonomic diversity (species richness and the Shannon-Weaver index), functional dominance (the community-weighted mean of four plant traits), functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy), and community aboveground biomass were analyzed. The results showed that (1) taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass all increased from low to high precipitation grassland types; (2) there were significant positive linear relationships between taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass; (3) the effect of functional characteristics on community aboveground biomass is greater than that of taxonomic diversity; and (4) community aboveground biomass depends on the community-weighted mean plant height, which explained 57.1% of the variation in the community aboveground biomass. Our results suggested that functional dominance rather than taxonomic diversity and functional diversity mainly determines community productivity and that the selection effect plays a dominant role in maintaining the relationship between biodiversity and community productivity in the Inner Mongolia grassland.","[Zhang, Qing; Li, Frank Yonghong; Niu, Jianming; Kang, Sarula; Ma, Wenjing] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Buyantuev, Alexander] SUNY Albany, Dept Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ding, Yong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grassland Res Inst, Hohhot, Peoples R China","Inner Mongolia University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS","Niu, JM (autor correspondente), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",jmniu2005@163.com,"Niu, Jianming/K-3597-2019; Li, Frank Yonghong/AAN-3093-2020; Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019; Buyantuev, Alexander/L-9887-2013","Li, Frank Yonghong/0000-0002-5137-8017; Buyantuev, Alexander/0000-0003-1670-0741; Zhang, Qing/0000-0002-3489-1417","National Basic Research Program of China [31200414, 31560180]; Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2012CB722201, 2014CB138802]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Key Basic Research Development Program of China,"National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 31200414 and 31560180; State Key Basic Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2012CB722201 and 2014CB138802.",NA,58,44,49,34,193,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, we test the effects of abiotic factors (light variation, caused by logging disturbance, and soil fertility) and biotic factors (species richness and functional trait composition) on biomass stocks (above-ground biomass, fine root biomass), SOM and productivity in a relatively monodominant Guyanese tropical rainforest. This forest grows on nutrient-poor soils and has few species that contribute most to total abundance. We, therefore, expected strong effects of soil fertility and species' traits that determine resource acquisition and conservation, but not of diversity. We evaluated 6years of data for 30 0.4-ha plots and tested hypotheses using structural equation models. Disturbance increased productivity but decreased above-ground biomass stocks. Soil phosphorus (P) enhanced above-ground biomass and productivity, whereas soil nitrogen reduced fine root biomass. In contrast to expectations, trait values representing acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf nutrient concentration) increased biomass stocks, possibly because they indicate higher nutrient absorption and thus higher biomass build-up. However, under harsh conditions where biomass increase is slow, acquisitive trait values may increase respiration and vulnerability to hazards and therefore increase biomass loss. As expected, species richness did not affect productivity. We conclude that light availability (through disturbance) and soil fertilityespecially Pstrongly limit forest biomass productivity and stocks in this Guyanese forest. Low P availability may cause strong environmental filtering, which in turn results in a small set of dominant species.

However, anthropogenic pressure from intensified forest management, eutrophication, and climate change may alter the ecosystem functions of understory vegetation and services boreal forests provide. Swedish forests span long gradients of climate, nitrogen deposition, and management intensity. This makes them ideal to study how the species composition and functions of other, more pristine, boreal forests might change under increased anthropogenic pressure. Moreover, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) has collected systematic data on Swedish forest vegetation since the mid-20th century. We use this data to quantify changes in vegetation types between two periods, 1953-1962 and 2003-2012. The results show changes in forest understory vegetation since the 1950s at scales not previously documented in the boreal biome. The spatial extent of most vegetation types changed significantly. Shade-adapted and nutrient-demanding species (those with high specific leaf area) have become more common at the expense of light-demanding and nutrient-conservative (low specific leaf area) species. The cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs decreased dramatically. These effects were strongest where anthropogenic impacts were greatest, suggesting links to drivers such as nitrogen deposition and land-use change. These changes may impact ecosystem functions and services via effects on higher trophic levels and faster plant litter decomposition in the expanding vegetation types. This, in turn, may influence nutrient dynamics, and consequently ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.","[Hedwall, Per-Ola; Brunet, Jorg; Lindbladh, Matts] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Lena; Strengbom, Joachim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, POB 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Axelsson, Anna-Lena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hedwall, PO (autor correspondente), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",per-ola.hedwall@slu.se,"Hedwall, Per-Ola/ABG-2195-2020; Strengbom, Joachim/AAE-7645-2022","Hedwall, Per-Ola/0000-0002-0120-7420; Strengbom, Joachim/0000-0002-1720-5016",Formas [217-2012-546],Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The committed work by the staff at the Swedish NFI made this study possible.

Neither the functional nor the phylogenetic diversity showed a significant advantage in predicting aboveground biomass and biomass production (aboveground biomass increment) when compared with species richness.ContextConsistent conclusions have still not been reached regarding the relative importance of the different diversity indices in predicting biomass production. Furthermore, the effects of certain forest strata on the BEF relationship remain unclear.MethodsThe woody plant species in the study area were classified as two vertical strata and were referred to as the overstorey (trees with dbh>10cm) and understorey (trees with dbh10cm). The relationships between different metrics of tree diversity and biomass production were quantified using linear models. The set of the best predictors for tree biomass and productions were determined using a multi-model selection approach. The differences in diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships between the two forest vertical strata, and the effects of canopy trees on the understorey trees, were investigated using structural equation models.AimsThe relative importance of the species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity in predicting the aboveground biomass production (ABP) was examined to compare the potential of phylogenetic and functional diversity indices and species richness in predicting biomass productivity and compare the influence of niche complementarity, selection effects, or mass-ratio effects on aboveground biomass variables and to assess possible differences in the BEF relationships between the overstorey and understorey layers in the studied ecosystems. Also, this study investigated possible differences in the BEF relationships between the overstorey and understorey layers in the studied ecosystems.ResultsThe results confirmed a positive diversity-productivity relationship in the natural coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest. However, the relationship in the overstorey stratum was statistically stronger than that in the understorey layer. The combination of diversity indices and functional traits could explain more of the variations in the biomass and productivity than when examined separately. The correlation between the richness of the overstorey and understorey species was found to be positive. However, the aboveground woody biomass of the overstorey layer had negative effects on the understorey biomass.ConclusionIn summary, this study found a stronger positive correlation between the woody plant diversity and productivity in the overstorey than in the understorey stratum. These findings indicate that the BEF relationships are hierarchically dependent, and supported by niche complementarity. Also, a much weaker relationship was observed between the functional diversity and biomass production than between the species diversity and biomass production due to a selection effect. The aboveground woody biomass was found to be enhanced in communities dominated by functional traits correlated to smaller leaf areas, greater maximum tree heights, and higher leaf carbon content. These findings suggest that the BEF relationships were driven by a mass-ratio hypothesis.","[Xu, Wei; Luo, Weixue; Zhang, Chunyu; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [von Gadow, Klaus] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Zhang, Zhonghui] Jilin Prov Acad Forestry Sci, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; University of Gottingen; Stellenbosch University,"Zhao, XH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",bfuz@163.com,"Zhang, Chun-yu/HDP-5776-2022; Zhang, Chunyu/GYA-2925-2022","Zhang, Chunyu/0000-0003-3091-5060",Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC0504104]; Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670643],Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan; Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFC0504104) and the Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670643).,NA,72,6,9,6,90,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Photosynthetic capacity was previously shown to increase as temperature declines with increasing elevation, counteracting enzyme-kinetic effects. Primary production declines, nonetheless, due to decreasing light availability. We aimed to predict leaf-trait and production gradients from first principles, using published data to test an emerging theory whereby photosynthetic traits and primary production depend on optimal acclimation and/or adaptation to environment. We re-analysed published data for 210 species at 25 sites, fitting linear relationships to elevation for both predicted and observed photosynthetic traits and primary production. Declining leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratio (chi) and increasing carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron-transport (J(max)) capacities with increasing elevation were predicted. Increases in leaf nitrogen content with elevation were explained by increasing V-cmax and leaf mass-per-area. Leaf and soil phosphorus covaried, but after controlling for elevation, no nutrient metric accounted for any additional variance in photosynthetic traits. Primary production was predicted to decline with elevation. This analysis unifies leaf and ecosystem observations in a common theoretical framework. The insensitivity of primary production to temperature is shown to emerge as a consequence of the optimisation of photosynthetic traits.","[Peng, Yunke] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Masters Programme Ecosyst & Environm Change, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot, Berks, England; [Peng, Yunke; Bloomfield, Keith J.; Prentice, Iain Colin] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, AXA Chair Programme Biosphere & Climate Impacts, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Prentice, Iain Colin] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Prentice, Iain Colin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Macquarie University; Tsinghua University,"Prentice, IC (autor correspondente), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, AXA Chair Programme Biosphere & Climate Impacts, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.;Prentice, IC (autor correspondente), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.;Prentice, IC (autor correspondente), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",c.prentice@imperial.ac.uk,,"Peng, Yunke/0000-0001-5240-0725",European Research Council (ERC) [787203],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),This research received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 787203 REALM).

We systematically investigated the LCV of 745 plant species in 9 forests, representing a range of tropical to cold-temperate forests along the 4700-km North-South Transect of Eastern China. The goals were to explore the latitudinal patterns of LCV at the levels of species, plant functional group, and community and to establish the relationship between LCV and gross primary productivity (GPP). Our results showed that LCV for all species ranged from 12.85 to 22.15 KJ g(-1) with an average of 18.46 KJ g(-1). Plant functional groups had a significant influence on LCV, with trees > shrubs > herbs, conifers > broad-leaved trees, and evergreens > deciduous trees. The different values of LCV represented the long-termevolution and adaptation of plant species to different environments. Unexpectedly, no apparent latitudinal trends of LCV at community level were observed, although LCV at the species level clearly decreased with increasing latitude. Use efficiency of LCV (CUE, gC KJ(-1)), defined as the ratio of GPP to total LCV at the community level, varied quadratic with latitude and was lower in the middle latitudes. Climate (temperature and precipitation) may explain 52.9% of the variation in spatial patterns of CUE, which was positively correlated with aridity. Our findings are the first large-scale report of the latitudinal patterns of LCV in forests at the species, plant functional group, and community levels and provide new insights into the relationship between LCV and ecosystem functions in forest communities.","[Song, Guangyan; Hou, Jihua; Li, Ying] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",houjihua@bjfu.edu.cn; henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953","Natural Science Foundation of China [31290221, 31570471]; Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences; Natural Resources Research, CAS [2013RC102]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences; Natural Resources Research, CAS","Funding for this work was applied by Dr. N.H. from the Natural Science Foundation of China (31290221, 31570471; http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/), and the Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS (2013RC102; http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/).

Plant productivity varies through time in response to environmental fluctuations. Reducing variability in productivity requires an improved understanding of how plant community attributes interact with environmental fluctuations to influence plant growth dynamics. We evaluated links between two community attributes, species diversity and abundance-weighted values of specific leaf area (SLA), and temporal variability in grassland productivity at patch (local) and aggregate (multi-patch) spatial scales. 2. Aggregate communities were created by combining patches of spatially distinct communities of perennial plant species from grassland biodiversity experiments in Texas, USA. Interannual variability in above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of aggregate communities was analysed as a function of two multiplicative components, mean temporal variability in the ANPP of patches and temporal synchrony in ANPP dynamics among patches. We used regression analyses to determine whether temporal variability in aggregate ANPP and its components were correlated with either species diversity or community-weighted SLA over 5 years. 3. Temporal variability in ANPP of aggregate communities was strongly correlated with temporal variability in patch ANPP. Increasing mean SLA reduced ANPP variability of aggregate communities by increasing mean productivity. Increased temporal changes in patch-scale SLA further reduced temporal variability in aggregate ANPP by reducing effects of precipitation fluctuations on productivity. Conversely, increasing species diversity over the narrow range measured increased temporal variability in aggregate ANPP. High diversity was associated with reduced dominance of temporally stable C-4 grasses. 4. Our results implicate means and patch-scale temporal dynamics in community SLA as potential indicators of variability in grassland primary productivity through time.","[Polley, H.

We studied altitudinal gradients of intraspecific variations in leaf traits, productivity and resource use efficiency in the dominant species of subalpine evergreen coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved forests in Japan. We addressed three hypotheses, which are exclusive to each other. (1) Leaf traits vary along the leaf economics spectrum (LES). Plants that grow at lower and higher altitudes have fast- and slow-return strategies, respectively, which improve productivity or resource use efficiency in the respective habitat. (2) Leaf trait variations are not consistent with the LES, but they contribute to improving productivity or resource use efficiency in the respective habitat. (3) Leaf trait variations do not contribute to improving productivity or resource use efficiency at higher altitudes. On the studied mountain range, Fagus crenata, a deciduous broad-leaved tree, and Abies mariesii, an evergreen conifer, are the dominant species at lower and higher altitudes respectively. In F. crenata, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen concentrations were higher at higher altitudes. The net assimilation rate and light use efficiency during the growing season were greater at higher altitudes, which compensated for the shorter growing season in terms of annual productivity. In A. mariesii, the LMA was lower and the leaf life span was unchanged at higher altitudes. Productivity and resource use efficiency decreased with altitude. Synthesis. We conclude that F. crenata improves its productivity and resource use efficiency at higher altitudes by altering its leaf functional traits (Hypothesis 2), whereas alterations to leaf traits in A. mariesii are not associated with any improvement at higher altitudes (Hypothesis 3), which may result from the negative impact of environmental stress. Hence, the ecological significance of altitudinal variations in leaf traits depends on species and environment.","[Hikosaka, Kouki; Kurokawa, Hiroko; Arai, Takahisa; Takayanagi, Sakino; Tanaka, Hiroshi O.; Nagano, Soichiro; Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kurokawa, Hiroko; Nakashizuka, Tohru] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Arai, Takahisa] Govt Japan, Minist Environm, Kanto Reg Environm Off, Saitama, Japan; [Takayanagi, Sakino] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Trop Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Tanaka, Hiroshi O.] Kansai Univ, Dai Ichi Jr High Sch, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Nagano, Soichiro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Forest Tree Breeding Ctr, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan",Tohoku University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Jikei University; Kansai University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN),"Hikosaka, K (autor correspondente), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.",hikosaka@tohoku.ac.jp,"Hikosaka, Kouki/A-5415-2013","Hikosaka, Kouki/0000-0003-1744-3775; Kurokawa, Hiroko/0000-0001-8778-8045; Takayanagi, Sakino/0000-0003-4066-5165; Nakashizuka, Tohru/0000-0003-1419-9527","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment [D-0904]; Mitsui Co., Ltd.; Environment Fund [R11-G4-1046]; JSPS KAKENHI [25291095, 25660113, 26281049, 7H03727, 17H03835, 20H03317]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26281049, 20H03317, 17H03835, 25660113] Funding Source: KAKEN","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment; Mitsui Co., Ltd.(Mitsui & Co., LTD.); Environment Fund; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment, Grant/Award Number: D-0904; The Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

Based on a dataset from the Northeast China Transect (NECT), we attempted to test the hypothesis by comparing an objective PFT identification framework in which large datasets of plant traits were considered with two subjective PFT frameworks in which only a few plant traits were involved. Additionally, we addressed the relations between the relative abundance of PFTs and the environmental gradient represented by actual evapotranspiration (AET) along the NECT. We also discuss the changes in ecosystem functioning associated with the PFT turnover along the environmental gradient. Based on an objective PFT classification, eight PFTs were identified: deciduous trees, shrubs, perennial forbs with lower net photosynthesis, perennial forbs with higher net photosynthesis, perennial bulb-grasses, perennial tiller-grasses, annual C-4 herbs and evergreen trees. Our results indicated that some plant traits, such as life form and photosynthesis pathway, are robust surrogates for PFTs, implying that subjective approaches to PFT classification are useful. Nonetheless, caution should be used during the classification of PFTs. The framework adopted for PFT classification should depend on the specific scientific issues being dealt with. It is therefore meaningless to pursue a general framework for the identification of PFTs even within given plant communities. On the other hand, our quantitative classification of PFTs confirmed recurrent patterns with respect to PFT turnover along an environmental gradient. Furthermore, with the turnover in PFT along the NECT from the west to the cast, ecosystem properties such as productivity and carbon storage are predicted to decrease, while photosynthesis is predicted to increase, suggesting that PFT turnover would inevitably lead to changes in ecosystem functioning.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Max Planck Society","Wang, GH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, 20 Nanxincun Xiangshan, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",ghwangaq@ibcas.ac.cn,", Wang/K-4344-2019; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",,,,NA,53,8,13,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

We analyze the drivers' underlying changes in rates of key ecosystem processes (biomass productivity, litter productivity, actual litter decomposition, and potential litter decomposition) during secondary succession after shifting cultivation in wet tropical forest of Mexico. We test the importance of three alternative drivers of ecosystem processes: vegetation biomass (vegetation quantity hypothesis), community-weighted trait mean (mass ratio hypothesis), and functional diversity (niche complementarity hypothesis) using structural equation modeling. This allows us to infer the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying ecosystem process recovery. Ecosystem process rates changed during succession, and the strongest driver was aboveground biomass for each of the processes. Productivity of aboveground stem biomass and leaf litter as well as actual litter decomposition increased with initial standing vegetation biomass, whereas potential litter decomposition decreased with standing biomass. Additionally, biomass productivity was positively affected by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, and potential decomposition was positively affected by functional divergence, and negatively by community-weighted mean of leaf dry matter content. Our empirical results show that functional diversity and community-weighted means are of secondary importance for explaining changes in ecosystem process rates during tropical forest succession. Instead, simply, the amount of vegetation in a site is the major driver of changes, perhaps because there is a steep biomass buildup during succession that overrides more subtle effects of community functional properties on ecosystem processes. We recommend future studies in the field of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to separate the effects of vegetation quality (community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity) from those of vegetation quantity (biomass) on ecosystem processes and services.","[Lohbeck, Madelon; Poorter, Lourens; Bongers, Frans] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Ecosistemas, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",madelon.lohbeck@wur.nl,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800","Wageningen University and Research Centre; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development) [W85-326]; NSF-LTREB [DEB-0639393, DEB 1147429]; MABOTRO projects SEMARNAT-CONACYT [2002-C01-0597]; SEP-CONACYT [CB-2005-01-51043, 2009-129740]; Nucleo DiverSus project by Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)CRN; SGP-CRA through National Science Foundation [GEO-0452325, GEO-1138881]; European Union [283093]; Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Directorate For Geosciences [1138881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1147429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Wageningen University and Research Centre; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development); NSF-LTREB(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MABOTRO projects SEMARNAT-CONACYT; SEP-CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Nucleo DiverSus project by Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)CRN; SGP-CRA through National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Union(European Commission); Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We are grateful for the assistance and hospitality of the community of Loma Bonita, and especially we thank Gilberto Jamangape for all his help.

In this study, we measured leaf economic, hydraulic and anatomical traits of 394 tree species from tropical to cold temperate forests, from which we calculated the leaf trait moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) using community-weighted methods. Economic and hydraulic traits were decoupled at the species level, but coupled at the community level, and relationships between leaf traits in observed communities were stronger than that in null communities, suggesting that the adaptive mechanisms of plant species may be different. Furthermore, leaf economic traits were distributed more evenly across species occupying communities with lower temperature and precipitation, whereas hydraulic traits were distributed more evenly under lower water availability. This suggests that limiting similarity of specific leaf traits within communities would be enhanced when related-resources are limited, and highlights the independent assembly of leaf economics and hydraulic traits in terms of functional evenness. Importantly, the moments of leaf economic and hydraulic traits of observed communities explained more variation in ecosystem productivity than that of null communities, indicating ecosystem productivity depended on trait-based community assembly. Our results highlight the principles of community assembly regarding multi-dimensionsional traits in natural forests at a regional scale.","[Liu, Congcong; Li, Ying; Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Baird, Alec S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Forestry University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Northeast Normal University - China","He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China.",henp@igsrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31988102, 31870437, 31872683]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0500202]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31988102, 31870437, and 31872683) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFC0500202).",NA,54,19,19,22,77,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Here, we use a simple model of community dynamics to predict how the functional consequences of random and non-random extinction may differ. The model suggests that when resource partitioning or facilitation structures communities, the functional consequences of non-random extinction depend on the covariance between species traits and cumulative extinction risks, and the compensatory responses among survivors. Strong competition increases the difference between random and ordered extinctions, but mutualisms reduce the difference. When diversity affects function via a sampling effect, the difference between random and ordered extinction depends on the covariance between species traits and the change in the probability of being the competitive dominant caused by ordered extinction. These findings show how random assembly experiments can be combined with information about species traits to make qualitative predictions about the functional consequences of various extinction scenarios.","N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",North Carolina State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Gross, K (autor correspondente), N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",gross@stat.ncsu.edu,"Gross, Kevin/AAX-1589-2020; Cardinale, Bradley J/I-7076-2013",,,,,NA,52,73,74,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Future drought events related to climate change, however, threaten grassland functionality in many regions across the globe. The introduction of sustainable grassland management could buffer these negative effects. According to the biodiversity-productivity hypothesis, productivity positively associates with local biodiversity. The biodiversity-insurance hypothesis states that higher biodiversity enhances the temporal stability of productivity. To date, these hypotheses have mostly been tested through experimental studies under restricted environmental conditions, hereby neglecting climatic variations at a landscape-scale. Here, we provide a landscape-scale assessment of the contribution of species richness, functional composition, temperature, and precipitation on grassland productivity. We found that the variation in grassland productivity during the growing season was best explained by functional trait composition. The community mean of plant preference for nutrients explained 24.8% of the variation in productivity and the community mean of specific leaf area explained 18.6%, while species richness explained only 2.4%. Temperature and precipitation explained an additional 22.1% of the variation in productivity.

This need is particularly acute in tropical ecosystems, home to over 60% of global terrestrial productivity, over half of planetary biodiversity, and hotspots of anthropogenic pressure. In recent years there has been a surge of activity in collecting data on the carbon cycle, productivity, and plant functional traits of tropical ecosystems, most intensively through the Global Ecosystems Monitoring network (GEM). The GEM approach provides valuable insights by linking field-based ecosystem ecology with the needs of Earth system science. In this paper, we review and synthesize the context, history and recent scientific output from the GEM network. Key insights have emerged on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity and on the role of temperature and drought stress on ecosystem function and resilience. New work across the network is now linking carbon cycling to nutrient cycling and plant functional traits, and subsequently to airborne remote sensing. We discuss some of the novel emerging patterns and practical and methodological challenges of this approach, and examine current and possible future directions, both within this network and as lessons for a more general terrestrial ecosystem observation scheme.","[Malhi, Yadvinder; Girardin, Cecile; Oliveras, Immaculada; Shenkin, Alexander; Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus; Dahlsj, Cecilia A.

Nonetheless, it is hard to understand the biodiversity measurements, because they involve gene, phenotypic, population, species, community and ecosystem diversity. The functional diversity refers to the species richness and variety, their characteristics and how that affects the functioning of an ecosystem. Primary productivity is a key factor that affects the functioning of a forest ecosystem. Thus, the aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence of functional diversity on the woody volume productivity (as a proxy for primary production) in the Brazilian savanna. We used six functional characteristics, and to verify the relation between forest production and functional diversity facets, we tested many models. Regarding wood volume, the best models were the exponential and logarithmic. None of the linear models showed significant regression parameters as there was no additive relationship among the multifaceted aspects of functional diversity and wood volume. We found a positive correlation between the functional diversity and primary productivity, which can be used to forecast the effects of diversity variation on ecosystem services.","[de Meira Junior, Milton Serpa] Univ Brasilia, Ciencias Florestais, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Imana Encinas, Jose; Rodrigues Pinto, Jose Roberto] Univ Brasilia, Dept Engn Florestal, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lima Mota, Silvia da Luz] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Fac Engn Florestal, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso,"de Meira, MS (autor correspondente), Univ Brasilia, Ciencias Florestais, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",milton.serpa@gmail.com,"Pinto, José Roberto Rodrigues/E-3243-2019","Pinto, José Roberto Rodrigues/0000-0003-2028-6176",,,,NA,54,2,2,0,17,UNIV FEDERAL UBERLANDIA,UBERLANDIA,"AV PARA, 1720 CAMPUS UMUARAMA, UBERLANDIA, 38400-902, BRAZIL",1981-3163,,,BIOSCI J,Biosci.

I found that: (1) multivariate statistical methods worked well to sort out the test species on axes defined primarily by productivity, which may have more redundancy than decomposition, and initial leaf nutrient content, (2) there were four plant functional groups defined by species (i)Psychotria berteriana, (ii)Cecropia schreberiana, (iii)Inga vera, and (iv) a group containing the other seven species, and (3) the plant traits of nitrogen-fixing capacity and mycorrhizal strategy mapped better onto these groups then those of seed size, wood density, shade tolerance or successional status.

Experiments often revealed an increase of productivity in species-rich ecosystems. But large variations in these relationships, both on a local scale and in comparisons of sites along environmental gradients, still challenge our understanding of the role of species (with specific traits) and their interactions in ecosystems. In this study, we explored the role of species traits for ecosystem functioning. We used an individual-based mechanistic grassland model which captures intra- and interspecific competition between plants for light and soil resources. We explored how the dynamics and productivity of grasslands are influenced by species traits and analyzed in a simulation study two species, which differ only in one particular trait. Our focus was on traits that determine how species can cope with resource limitations, for which we identified their relative importance for (1) individual plant growth, (2) monoculture dynamics, and (3) species mixture dynamics. We observed diverse relationships between species traits and different vegetation attributes for the different ecosystem levels. Most traits showed positive but saturating trends of increasing trait values but the variability in these relations increased in monocultures with intraspecific plant interactions and even more pronounced in mixtures with interspecific interactions. Using a process-based grassland model, we were able to simulate overyielding even though it was not correlated with trait values or trait differences between both species. Correlations were also not found in terms of stability of vegetation dynamics. In contrast, for some traits already small differences supported the dominance of a species in the mixture in which species dynamics generally followed trade-offs. The here presented simulation study demonstrates the use of process-based models for analyzing trait-productivity relationships in grasslands. Such models can complement previous approaches in empirical and theoretical biodiversity research and can help to move closer to understanding the mechanisms governing grassland dynamics.","[Taubert, Franziska; Hetzer, Jessica; Schmid, Julia S.; Huth, Andreas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Huth, Andreas] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Huth, Andreas] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Barbarastr 12, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University Osnabruck,"Taubert, F (autor correspondente), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",franziska.taubert@ufz.de,,"Taubert, Franziska/0000-0001-7594-8152; Schmid, Julia/0000-0003-2378-8980; Hetzer, Jessica/0000-0002-2384-0024",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2818301116]; Projekt DEAL,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); Projekt DEAL,"FT, JSS, and AH are supported (were supported) by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support program (Grant No. 2818301116).

Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.","[Berdugo, Miguel;

The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait variability (ITV), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores the effects of ITV on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects on shifts in community -wide traits, we highlight the role of ITV in community functional response to grazing and its implications for ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows. 2. We measured three chemical traits (LC: leaf carbon, LN: leaf nitrogen and LP: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content) that are critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means (CWM) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance of ITV vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient availability. 3. The CWM for foliar nutrients and SLA(CWM) increased in response to grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores, especially LPCWM enrichment and loss of available soil P. The LPCWM was strongly negatively correlated with LDMCCWM, which was significantly higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to grazing were generally best captured by ITV and not changes in species occurrence and abundance, although ITV was consistently correlated with species turnover for all traits. 4. Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus. We discuss the implications of these results for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem function and rangeland sustainability in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, especially with regard to managing grazing rotation to strike a balance between favouring secondary productivity of domesticated stock vs. small herbivorous mammals","[Niu, Kechang] Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; Lechowicz, Martin J.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",Nanjing University; Peking University; McGill University,"Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",kechangniu@nju.edu.cn,"Niu, Kechang/F-7648-2014; Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009","Niu, Kechang/0000-0003-4845-2930; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Lechowicz, Martin/0000-0003-2562-7136",National Science Foundation of China [31370008]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956304],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"We thank Professor Shucun Sun, Philippe Choler, Marc Cadotte, Lara Souza and two anonymous referees for valuable discussion and constructive comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

We tested the relationship between aboveground biomass (AGB) and various aspects of functional diversity (functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv)), functional beta diversity and functional composition. Our study areas were located in four different bioclimatic regions including desert-steppe, steppe, semi-steppe, and Mediterranean rangelands extending along a productivity gradient created by the elevational-rainfall variations in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran. The results showed that FDiv positively predicted AGB in more productive (i.e., Mediterranean) and negatively in less productive rangelands of desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe. Functional beta diversity predicted AGB only in more productive regions in semi-steppe and Mediterranean rangelands. Functional beta diversity decomposed into turnover and nestedness, with turnover being more important in more productive and nestedness being more important in less productive ecosystems. The results also showed that the effects of FD and functional beta diversity on AGB are generally directed by animal grazing through homogenizing community-wide trait composition in less productive ecosystems and inducing shifting mosaics across locations in more productive ecosystem. The results indicate that different components of FD were significantly related to AGB and the strength and direction of these effects vary with the different components studied and the bioclimatic regions under the study. In higher productive ecosystems, both functional diversity and functional beta diversity are likely to contribute more to AGB through the complementary use of the resources. In less productive ecosystems, however, the functional identity of dominant species and traits would drive AGB. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

However, there is little consensus about which modes of functional biodiversity are most important for tree growth at large spatial scales. Here we assessed the relative importance of climate, functional diversity and functional identity (i.e. the community mean values of four key functional traits) for tree growth across the European continent, spanning the northern boreal to the southern Mediterranean forests. LocationFinland, Germany, Sweden, Spain and Wallonia (Belgium). MethodsUsing data from five European national forest inventories we applied a hierarchical linear model to estimate the sensitivity of tree growth to changes in climate, functional diversity and functional identity along a latitudinal gradient. ResultsFunctional diversity was weakly related to tree growth in the temperate and boreal regions and more strongly in the Mediterranean region. In the temperate region, where climate was the most important predictor, functional diversity and identity had a similar importance for tree growth. Functional identity was strongest at the latitudinal extremes of the continent, largely driven by strong changes in the importance of maximum height along the latitudinal gradient. Main conclusionsFunctional diversity is an important driver of tree growth in the Mediterranean region, providing evidence that niche complementarity may be more important for tree growth in water-limited forests. The strong influence of functional identity at the latitudinal extremes indicates the importance of a particular trait composition for tree growth in harsh climates. Furthermore, we speculate that this functional identity signal may reflect a trait-based differentiation of successional stages rather than abiotic filtering due to water or energy limitation.","[Ratcliffe, Sophia; Liebergesell, Mario; Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Madrigal Gonzalez, Jaime; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Castaneda, Jose M.

Growing evidence has revealed that ecosystem productivity depends more on the functional characteristics of species than on their number. However, exactly to what extent tree diversity effects on ecosystem productivity are influenced by the variability and composition of functional traits have rarely been tested both across and at given species richness (SR) levels. Here, we employed a meta-analysis of global-scale data from 59 tree diversity experiments to examine how the diversity and community-weighted means (CWMs) of economics traits determine the outcomes of tree mixture effects on productivity across and within SR levels. We found that the positive effects of tree mixtures on productivity were strengthened by the increasing multidimensional functional dispersion (FDis) and the CWM of leaf nitrogen content both across and within two- and four-species mixtures. Moreover, the multidimensional FDis and the CWM of leaf nitrogen content increased the complementarity effect rather than the selection effect. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that both diversity in the leaf economics spectrum and trait concentration on the 'fast' end of the spectrum strengthen biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. This study provides mechanistic insights into the potent roles of plant economics traits, especially leaf nitrogen content, in determining the magnitude (and even directionality) of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in forest ecosystems.","[Zheng, Li-Ting; Biswas, Shekhar R.; Bao, Di-Feng; Fang, Xiao-Chen; Abdullah, Muhammad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestor, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci,Forest Ecosyst Res & Obse, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Biswas, Shekhar R.; Bao, Di-Feng; Fang, Xiao-Chen; Abdullah, Muhammad; Yan, En-Rong] Inst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

The vast majority of empirical research in this context is based on relatively small-scaled experiments, where plant species composition is manipulated and ecosystem functions, such as biomass production, are monitored through time. Results of these studies have generally shown that ecosystem functioning is more stable in more species-diverse communities. Yet, there is very little evidence so far that these relations also hold in naturally assembled plant communities. In this study, we combined historical vegetation and climate data with time series of remotely sensed indicators of aboveground biomass production (MODIS NDVI), to quantify how plant species diversity and plant functional diversity correlate with the temporal stability of biomass production in naturally assembled Dutch dune grasslands under the influence of fluctuating drought. We found that the negative NDVI response to drought of grasslands with a higher plant species richness and diversity was significantly lower than the response of less species rich and species-diverse grasslands, indicating a stabilizing role of plant species richness and diversity on biomass production through time. We found no relation between plant functional diversity and NDVI response to drought. This is the first study to generalize experimentally established relations between species diversity and stability of ecosystem functioning to naturally assembled grasslands across a large spatial and temporal scale.","[van Rooijen, Nils M.; Honnay, Olivier] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [de Keersmaecker, Wanda; Coppin, Pol] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, BIORES M3, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Ozinga, Wim A.; Hennekens, Stephan M.; Schaminee, Joop H.

Our results showed that latitudinal variation in species-level SDL and SLL was minimal, but community-level SDC and SLC decreased clearly with increasing latitude. The relationship between SD and SL was negative across species and different plant functional types (PFTs), but positive at the community level. Furthermore, community-level SDC correlated positively with forest NPP, and explained 51% of the variation in NPP. These findings indicate that the trade-off by regulating SDL and SLL may be an important strategy for plant individuals to adapt to environmental changes, and temperature acts as the main factor influencing community-level stomatal traits through alteration of species composition.

Extensive research has shown that a decrease in species diversity and an increase in productivity are a common phenomenon following fertilization in grasslands ecosystem. The magnitude of the response of species diversity and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to fertilization mainly depends on species traits (mean trait values) and traits variability (plasticity). Our aim of this study was to examine (i) changes of species diversity (species richness and Shannon-Wiener index) and ANPP following fertilization; (ii) which species traits or community-weighted mean (CWM) traits can determine ANPP, as expected from the 'biomass ratio hypothesis'; and (iii) the relative role of intra-specific and inter-specific trait variability in this process following fertilization. Methods We measured ANPP and four key plant functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), mature plant height (MPH) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) for 25 component species along a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, trait variation of species was assessed using coefficients of variation (CV), and we calculated the ratio of the CVintra to the CVinter. Important Findings Our results showed that: (i) fertilization significantly reduced species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index, but significantly increased ANPP; (ii) there was a significant positive correlation between ANPP and CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH, yet there was no significant relationship between ANPP and CWM-LNC or CWM-LDMC; (iii) intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH was found to be much greater than inter-specific variability, especially at the higher fertilization levels. We concluded that CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH can be used to assess the impacts of species changes on ecosystem functioning, and dominant species can maximize resource use through intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH to compensate for the loss of species following fertilization, therefore maintaining high community productivity.","[Li, Wei; Cheng, Jimin] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Jing, Guanghua; Cheng, Jimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Jing, Guanghua; Cheng, Jimin] Minist Water Resource, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jie] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 22 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Epstein, Howard E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, 291 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Virginia; Lanzhou University","Li, W (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liwei2013@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [41230852]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-EW-TZ-G10]; Northwest A F University [Z109021107, Z109021307, QN2013070]; West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences [K318021305]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2016JQ3008]; China Scholarship Council",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Northwest A F University; West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (41230852), Key Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KJZD-EW-TZ-G10), Northwest A & F University (Z109021107, Z109021307, QN2013070), West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (K318021305), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2016JQ3008) and the China Scholarship Council.",NA,61,12,13,4,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Experimental work has led to the proposal of mechanisms such as niche complementarity. However, few attempts have been made to confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests. Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved questions is whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic diversity) better relates to tree productivity? Location Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern Canada. Methods Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for tree productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices, were included in a structural equation model where links (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit, making structural equation modelling the best tool to explore such complicated causal networks. Results This is the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity with control for climatic and environmental conditions. Important differences were noted between the two forest biomes investigated. Main conclusions We show for the first time that complementarity may be less important in temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive environment where competitive exclusion is the most probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial interactions between species may be more important. The present work is also a framework for the analysis of large datasets in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) research.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, POB 8888,Ctr Ville Stn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,"Paquette, Alain/F-4919-2011",,,,,NA,52,581,608,22,604,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Less is known about the role of biodiversity in natural ecosystems, including forests, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling and climate. In general, experimental manipulations of tree diversity will take decades to yield final results. To date, biodiversity effects in natural forests therefore have only been reported from sample surveys or meta-analyses with plots not initially selected for diversity. We studied biomass and growth of subtropical forests stands in southeastern China. Taking advantage of variation in species recruitment during secondary succession, we adopted a comparative study design selecting forest plots to span a gradient in species richness. We repeatedly censored the stem diameter of two tree size cohorts, comprising 93 species belonging to 57 genera and 33 families. Tree size and growth were analyzed in dependence of species richness, the functional diversity of growth-related traits, and phylogenetic diversity, using both general linear and structural equation modeling. Successional age covaried with diversity, but differently so in the two size cohorts. Plot-level stem basal area and growth were positively related with species richness, while growth was negatively related to successional age. The productivity increase in species-rich, functionally and phylogenetically diverse plots was driven by both larger mean sizes and larger numbers of trees. The biodiversity effects we report exceed those from experimental studies, sample surveys and meta-analyses, suggesting that subtropical tree diversity is an important driver of forest productivity and re-growth after disturbance that supports the provision of ecological services by these ecosystems.","[Barrufol, Martin; Schmid, Bernhard; Hector, Andrew; Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Geobot & Bot Garden, Inst Biol, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Chi, Xiulian; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chi, Xiulian; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Michalski, Stefan] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany","University of Zurich; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)","Niklaus, PA (autor correspondente), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",pascal.niklaus@ieu.uzh.ch,"Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Baruffol, Martin/A-2406-2014; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Chi, Xiulian/A-8898-2015; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Tang, Zhiyao/B-8795-2008; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Baruffol, Martin/0000-0001-9358-5885; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Tang, Zhiyao/0000-0003-0154-6403","German Science Foundation [DFG FOR 891/1]; Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion [GZ 524, 592, 698, 699]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC 31021001]; National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change [2010CB50600]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change(National Basic Research Program of China),"Funding was provided by the German Science Foundation (http://www.dfg.de; DFG FOR 891/1), the Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion (http://www.sinogermanscience.org.cn; GZ 524, 592, 698 and 699), the National Science Foundation of China (http://www.nsfc.gov.cn; NSFC 31021001), and the National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change (http://www.973.gov.cn/Default_3.aspx; #2010CB50600).

Understanding how plant diversity affects Delta AGB in diverse abiotic conditions is crucial in the face of anthropogenic environmental change. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the effects of plant diversity on growth dependent on the abiotic context, either supporting or rejecting the stress gradient hypothesis. However, we know little about how diversity influences mortality, which prevents us from knowing how diversity affects Delta AGB in diverse abiotic conditions. Location Across Canada (43-60 degrees N, 52-133 degrees W). Time period 1951-2016. Major taxa studied Ninety-three tree species. Methods We modelled the relationships of growth, mortality and Delta AGB with functional diversity that represented niche complementarity, while simultaneously accounting for the influence of functional identity and stand age. Results Growth and mortality increased, on average, with functional diversity, but the magnitude of the increase in growth was greater than that of mortality, resulting in an increase of Delta AGB. The positive relationship between growth and functional diversity was more prominent in more humid sites than in drier sites. Mortality increased with functional diversity in drier sites but did not increase in wetter sites. The positive relationship between Delta AGB and functional diversity was strengthened with water availability. Moreover, the positive relationship between growth and functional diversity became stronger with temperature, but the positive associations of diversity with mortality and Delta AGB were consistent across the gradient of temperature. Main conclusions Our results suggest that higher functional diversity leads to an increase in forest biomass accumulation owing to a greater positive effect of functional diversity on productivity than on mortality. However, in contrast to the stress gradient hypothesis, our findings show that the positive effect of functional diversity is more pronounced in an environment favourable for growth.","[Hisano, Masumi; Chen, Han Y.

Nevertheless, there is paucity of data on the characterization of microhabitat effects on species/trait diversity and diversity-functional relationships in urban landscapes especially in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to; 1) analyze tree species diversity and composition of urban green space (UGS) types and urban zones, (2) describe the life history diversity of UGS types and urban zones and 3) examine the links between species and life history trait diversity and species productivity (carbon storage) in Kumasi, Ghana. Stratified random sampling was adopted in surveying 470 sampling plots and six streets of lengths ranging from 50m to 1km. About 176 tree species in 46 families were recorded within Kumasi. About 96 species were in an adjacent natural forest located at the outskirts of the city. Home gardens, institutional compounds, and public parks had the highest species richness of 76, 75 and 71, respectively while urban rangelands and farmlands were the least species rich with 6 and 23, respectively. Species richness (S) in the peri-urban (LDUZ, S=142) and core urban (HDUZ, S=108) were significantly different ((2)=15.7, p<0.0001, n=1). Native species richness was lowest in the core urban area and highest in the natural forest. Pioneers and anthropochory dispersed species were the most abundant, suggesting that this urban landscape is shaped by both environment and social filters. Tree species diversity and distribution depend on the type of UGS and portrays a perturbed landscape in the early seres of succession with the overall ecosystem function sustained by both species and life history trait diversities. The implications of these findings for improving urban biodiversity conservation and overall urban sustainability are discussed.","[Nero, Bertrand Festus] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, PMB, FRNR, Dept Forest Resources Technol, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Nero, BF (autor correspondente), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, PMB, FRNR, Dept Forest Resources Technol, Kumasi, Ghana.",bfn8puo@gmail.com,"?, ??/GZH-2618-2022; Nero, Bertrand/ABA-7231-2020",,Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis,Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis,"Funding for this project was provided by Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis.

Biomass production is influenced by management legacies, landscape configuration and soil, but these drivers are rarely studied simultaneously, nor is the role of changes in vegetation properties in linking them to biomass production. We assessed how management legacies affect biomass in secondary forests created by slash and burn in the central Congo Basin, and tested whether changes in productivity could be attributed to changes in stem density, functional diversity, functional identity or soil. Using data from 6452 trees in 96 fallow plots nested in 3 study sites, we looked for the main determinants of aboveground biomass (AGB) of woody vegetation in fallow systems. Next, using a subset of 58 plots in fallow fields aged 5 to 10 years, we used confirmatory path analysis to explore the relations between management history, soil, vegetation properties and biomass productivity. The sampled fallow fields had, on average, 58.4(+/- 46.2) Mg ha(-1) AGB. AGB was positively related to both fallow age and to the proportion of remnant trees in AGB and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles. Biomass productivity varied with the number of previous slash-and-burn cycles, with notable declines in the fourth cycle. The effect of management history was mainly through a reduction in the dominance of fast growing tree species and in the number of regenerating stems, which were also indirectly affected by an increase in C. odorata cover.

In the context of managing forests for climate change mitigation/adaptation, maximizing and/or maintaining aboveground biomass will require understanding the interactions between tree biodiversity, site productivity, and the stocking of live trees. Species richness may not be the most appropriate tree biodiversity metric in this context as it weights all species as equally important. Measures that account for evolutionary relationships among species should be more biologically meaningful surrogates of functional diversity within forest communities, given that more phylogenetically distinct species should contribute more to the diversity of traits within a community. Using data from approximately 79,000 permanent and standardized forest inventory plots across the United States, we assessed trends in live aboveground tree biomass (LAGB) in relation to metrics of forest tree biodiversity at national and regional scales, controlling for site productivity and live tree stocking. These metrics included four measures of evolutionary diversity associated with distinct components of functional variation. In certain situations and locations across the U.S., evolutionary diversity metrics supply additional information about forest stands beyond that provided by simple species richness counts. This information can potentially include critical insight into tree functional attributes inherently related to evolutionary diversity. Relationships nationally between LAGS and most biodiversity metrics weakened with increasing site productivity and with increasing live tree stocking: The greater the site productivity and tree stocking, the less likely that higher biodiversity was associated with greater LAGB. This is consistent with the expectation that the coexistence of functionally different species increases forest productivity in less productive and more stressful environments, while dominant and highly productive species are able to competitively dominate in more productive habitats. Phylogenetic species clustering (PSC) was increasingly correlated with LAGB as live tree stocking increased on low-productivity sites, suggesting that the co-occurrence of tree species more widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of life, and therefore likely possessing a wider variety of functional attributes, resulted in greater biomass accumulation on poorer sites. PSC and species richness appear to be the best biodiversity predictors for LAGB on the low-productivity sites likely to be most important for carbon/biomass management. These biodiversity metrics will be important for maximizing biomass/carbon for future carbon sequestration or bioenergy needs and should serve as indicators of forest function in forest resource assessments.

In the attempt to reconcile these apparently inconsistent results, we explored whether the strength and shape of AWP-diversity relationships shifts along spatial and temporal environmental gradients in forests across Europe. We used tree ring data from a network of permanent forest plots distributed at six sites across Europe to estimate annual AWP over a 15-year period (1997-2011). We then tested whether the relationship between tree species richness and AWP changes (i) across sites as a function of large-scale gradients in climatic productivity and tree packing density and (ii) among years within each sites as a result of fluctuating climatic conditions. AWP-species richness relationships varied markedly among sites. As predicted by theory, the relationship shifted from strongly positive at sites where climate imposed a strong limitation on wood production and tree packing densities were low, to weakly negative at sites where climatic conditions for growth were most suitable. In contrast, we found no consistent effect of interannual fluctuations in climate on the strength of AWP-species richness relationships within sites.Synthesis. Our results indicate that the shape and strength of the relationship between tree diversity and forest productivity depends critically on environmental context. Across Europe, tree diversity shows the greatest potential to positively influence forest productivity at either end of the latitudinal gradient, where adverse climatic conditions limit productivity and lead to the development of less densely packed stands.","[Jucker, Tommaso; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Avacaritei, Daniel; Barnoaiea, Ionut; Duduman, Gabriel; Bouriaud, Olivier] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Forestry Fac, 13 Str Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania",University of Cambridge; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Jucker, T (autor correspondente), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",tj272@cam.ac.uk,"Bouriaud, Olivier/GQI-3650-2022; Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011; Daniel, Avacaritei/E-9101-2019","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X; Daniel, Avacaritei/0000-0002-7680-7017; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582; Duduman, Gabriel/0000-0002-6936-5791; Barnoaiea, Ionut/0000-0002-0327-4336",European Union [265171],European Union(European Commission),"We thank FunDivEUROPE site managers and field technicians for establishing the permanent plots, and are grateful to I.

However, in recent decades, most ecologists have primarily focused on species diversity while paying little attention to functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity (PD), especially in alpine meadow communities following fertilization. In this study, a fertilization experiment involving the addition of nitrogen, phosphorus, and a mixture of both was implemented in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Species diversity, functional diversity, and PD were measured, and the responses of these parameters to the variation in productivity were analyzed. We found that the productivity of alpine plant communities was colimited by N and P, with N being the principal and P being the secondary limiting nutrient. Our results supported the prediction of both the mass ratio hypothesis and niche complementarity hypothesis in fertilized communities, but these hypotheses were not mutually exclusive. The combination of different aspects of biodiversity not only provides a crucial tool to explain the variation in productivity and to understand the underlying mechanisms but also plays an important role in predicting the variation in productivity of -alpine meadow communities, which are sensitive to nutrient enrichment in the context of global change.","[Zhou, Xiaolong; Guo, Zhi; Zhang, Pengfei; Li, Honglin; Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolong] Xinjiang Univ, Inst Arid Ecol & Environm, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, SYSU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Conservat, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xilai] Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, Xining, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Xinjiang University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Qinghai University,"Du, GZ (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",guozdu@lzu.edu.cn,"Chu, Chu/T-6038-2019","Chu, Chengjin/0000-0002-0606-449X; zhou, xiaolong/0000-0001-6412-2232; Zhang, Pengfei/0000-0001-7959-9092",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41430749],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41430749",NA,93,18,20,19,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We obtained multiple overyielding values by comparing productivity in a five-species mixture to expected values from its component monocultures at a) six levels of nitrogen addition (spanning 0-500 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and b) across four seasons. We also measured light, water, and nitrogen use, resource-use efficiency, and three functional traits-leaf nitrogen content, specific leaf area, and leaf area ratio-n mixtures and monocultures. We found strong evidence for non-transgressive overyielding. This was strongest in spring, with mixture productivity exceeding expected values by 20 kg dry matter ha(-1) day(-1). Peak overyielding was driven by enhanced complementarity, with the two non-N-2-fixing forb species far exceeding expected productivity in mixtures. Peak overyielding also coincided with higher water use in the mixture than for any monoculture, and enhanced mixture-resource-use efficiency. There was only weak evidence that trait plasticity influenced overyielding or resource use. Our findings suggest that when complementarity drives overyielding in grassland mixtures, and this is made possible both by increased water use and enhanced efficiency in water, nitrogen, and light use. Our results also suggest that mixtures offer a viable compromise between productivity, resource-use efficiency, and reduced environmental impacts (i.e., nitrate leaching) from intensive agriculture.","[Mason, Norman W.

These extreme climate events can change ecosystem functions through driving plant growth and mortality, as well as ecological and evolutionary processes into different directions. We simulated a 1-in-100-year extreme precipitation event in different plant growth seasons (i.e. spring, summer, or autumn) to investigate the functional responses of a mesophytic alpine grassland ecosystem to climate change in the Tibetan plateau. The results demonstrated that the seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation is a critical factor in determining soil microbial- and plant-productivity. The response of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) to extreme precipitation depends on the growth seasons and plant types. Total NPP in the treatments experienced extreme precipitation in the early (spring), mid- (summer) and late (autumn) plant growth seasons were significant lower, higher, and no difference, respectively, compared with the control. Soil temperature and moisture were the key abiotic factors that affected ecosystem functions. For example, in the early plant growth season, no changes of soil moisture and the decreased temperature in response to the extreme precipitation resulted in a substantial decline in NPP. By contrast, in the mid-plant growth season, higher temperature and soil moisture elicited positive synergistic effects on plant growth and soil microbial processes. The increased sensitivity of above-ground NPP and the shift of dominant species from sedges to less palatable forbs might inevitably exaggerate the degradation of this grassland. Nevertheless, a high resilience index in the related ecological processes could potentially contribute to the grassland acclimation and stability, as most parameters returned to the similar levels as in the control after the extreme events ceased. Therefore, several synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms are hypothesized to operate in parallel or at different levels of organization and timescales. Further studies involving a range of different potential scenarios and longer periods are needed to predict the future climate change impacts on mesophytic grassland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding how that biome responds to seasonality in water availability is essential to build scenarios of ecosystem functioning in the near future. Aims: Our aim was to test for seasonal variations in leaf traits related to primary productivity. Methods: Chemical composition, mass to area ratio and photosynthetic response curves to light and CO2 and of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to leaf-to-air water pressure deficit (nu) were determined from leaves of Amazonian trees and lianas. Results: Weak responses of g(s) to nu suggested limited stomatal control over transpiration. Dry season stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was not a common feature as only one individual studied (out of 14) exhibited concomitant decreases in light saturated photosynthetic rate (A(Sat)) and g(s) (measured during A(Sat)) associated with the dry season. Furthermore, 75% of the individuals evaluated did not show decreased photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax) during the dry season, suggesting limited seasonal leaf acclimation. Grouped analyses indicated that most parameters evaluated remained constant across seasons. The exceptions were leaf nitrogen and its isotopic signature, and the integrated stomatal sensitivity to light, CO2 and nu. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the notion that the dry season in eastern Amazonia is not associated with significant limitations in leaflevel photosynthesis.","[Domingues, Tomas F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Clima & Biosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfer, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Martinelli, Luiz A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Domingues, TF (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Clima & Biosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfer, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",tdomingu@gmail.com,"Domingues, Tomas/G-9707-2011; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Martinelli, Luiz Antonio/F-7870-2011","Domingues, Tomas/0000-0003-2857-9838; Martinelli, Luiz Antonio/0000-0002-7103-7551",NASA LBA-Ecology; NASA LBA-Ecology grant,NASA LBA-Ecology; NASA LBA-Ecology grant,"We are in debt to our friends at the LBA-ECO Santarem office, to D.

However, the impact of temperature on primary productivity is not sufficiently understood and water quality models need to be improved in order to assess the quantitative and qualitative changes of aquatic communities. On the basis of experimental data, we demonstrate that the commonly used photosynthetic and water chemistry parameters alone are not sufficient for modeling phytoplankton growth under changing temperature regimes. We present some new aspects of the acclimation process with respect to temperature and how contrasting responses may be explained by a more complete physiological knowledge of the energy flow from photons to new biomass. We further suggest including additional bio-markers/traits for algal growth such as carbon allocation patterns to increase the explanatory power of such models. Although carbon allocation patterns are promising and functional cellular traits for growth prediction under different nutrient and light conditions, their predictive power still waits to be tested with respect to temperature. A great challenge for the near future will be the prediction of primary production efficiencies under the global change scenario using a uniform model for phytoplankton assemblages.

Coastal wetlands are poorly represented in land surface models, but work is underway to improve process-based, predictive modeling of these ecosystems. Here, we identify guiding questions, potential simulations, and data needs to make progress in improving representation of vegetation in terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, with a focus on coastal and estuarine ecosystems. We synthesize relevant plant traits and environmental controls on vegetation that influence carbon cycling in coastal ecosystems. We propose that models include separate plant functional types (PFTs) for mangroves, graminoid salt marshes, and succulent salt marshes to adequately represent the variation in aboveground and belowground productivity between common coastal wetland vegetation types. We also discuss the drivers and carbon storage consequences of shifts in dominant PFTs. We suggest several potential approaches to represent the diversity in vegetation tolerance and adaptations to fluctuations in salinity and water level, which drive key gradients in coastal wetland ecosystems. Finally, we discuss data needs for parameterizing and evaluating model implementations of coastal wetland vegetation types and function.","[LaFond-Hudson, Sophia; Sulman, Benjamin] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37917 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"LaFond-Hudson, S (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37917 USA.",slafond09@gmail.com,,"LaFond-Hudson, Sophia/0000-0002-0860-2546",Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program; US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725],Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program.

Comparably little is known about how forest communities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community-level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species-level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species richness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more different. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated positive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition-driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized complementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two-species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness-productivity relationships are promoted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.","[Niklaus, Pascal A.; Baruffol, Martin; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolut Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","University of Zurich; Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Niklaus, PA (autor correspondente), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolut Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",pascal.niklaus@ieu.uzh.ch,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Baruffol, Martin/A-2406-2014","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Baruffol, Martin/0000-0001-9358-5885",,,,NA,63,51,52,9,158,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2017,98,4,,,,NA,1104,1116,,,,NA,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EQ6ES,28129429,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000398175200022,0,Kauane,sim,,sim,sim,sim,forest,subtropical,NA,2,NA,leaf_habit((broadleaf_or_conifer);seasonality(evergreen_or_deciduous);leaf_mass_fraction;WD;SLA;LDMC;height; mean_leaf_height,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biodiversity can contribute to increasing the ecosystem function, but its effect on consumer trophic levels remains inconclusive. We generated a multitrophic seed-herbivore-parasitoid food web based on seed traits, insect species abundance and richness, structural and functional food web attributes and the relationship between the seed biomass and the number of eggs laid by the herbivorous beetle Stator maculatophygus. We hypothesized that the food web structure (i.e., connectivity, linkage density and connectance) was determined by the parasitoid trophic levels. Our second hypothesis was that food web functionality (e.g., the parasitism rate) was not affected by the dominance of a single parasitoid species. From the seeds of a plant species (Senegalia tenufolia) (primary trophic level), we recorded nine species and four trophic levels, with one herbivore and seven parasitoids. A significant positive relationship was found between the number of eggs laid and the seed biomass. Connectivity and linkage density were affected by the parasitoid trophic level, and the dominance of a single parasitoid species led to decreases in the structural complexity and the parasitism rate. We described the relationship between structure and function in the field in a multitrophic host-parasitoid food web. The biodiversity of parasitoids plays an important role in the food web, maintaining its complexity and functionality. Synergies between processes acting at lower and higher levels may be driving the food web patterns presented here. Implications for insect conservation Our results highlight the positive role of parasitoid insect biodiversity in the biological population control of herbivorous insects in this microhabitat (fruit/seed). This demonstrates the importance of public policies aimed at the conservation of natural areas to maintain the diversity and ecosystem functions performed by parasitoid insects.","[Pedroso, Beatriz Mariana; Faria, Lucas Del Bianco] Univ Fed Lavras, Inst Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Conservacao, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Morales-Silva, Tiago] Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Entomol, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Faria, LD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Inst Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Conservacao, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil.;Morales-Silva, T (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Entomol, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",tiagomorales.bio@gmail.com; lucasdbf@gmail.com,"Faria, Lucas/HZJ-0984-2023; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/I-1832-2013; Morales-Silva, Tiago/AFS-9983-2022","Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/0000-0002-7230-800X; Morales-Silva, Tiago/0000-0002-7681-0312",FundacAo de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [140627/2017-0]; CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq: 306196/2018-2],FundacAo de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Pedroso, B.

The root-soil interface is a highly active zone due to root exudation and nutrient uptake. However, its role in determining effects of tree species and their interactions on the soil microbial community, ecosystem function and above-ground growth is less well known. We compared the effects of tree species monocultures and their mixture on rhizospheric microbial communities, specific functional genetic markers associated with processes in the nitrogen (N) cycle, and above-ground and below-ground growth and nutrient allocation. Two pairs of tree species were grown: Pseudotsuga menziesii and Alnus rubra; Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus robur. Tree establishment altered soil microbial composition, but after 26 months differences amongst tree species and effects of species mixture were minor, suggesting functional redundancy in microbial communities. A greater abundance of fungi, bacteria, and specifically ammonia oxidising and denitrifying bacteria in the rhizospheric soil of the N-fixing A. rubra was the most notable trend. Mixing A. rubra with P. menziesii did produce overyielding: trees grown in mixture attained a two-fold greater (Relative Yield Total 2.03 & PLUSMN; 0.52) above-ground biomass than in a mixture predicted from trees grown in monoculture. We did not observe strong trends in overyielding for A. psuedoplatanus and Q. robur. Inclusion of the N-fixing species A. rubra in admixture with P. menziesii promoted N cycling, and decreased the C: N ratios of leaf, branch, and root tissues but not soil C:N ratio for P. menziesii. Given the observed overyielding in the A. rubra with P. menziesii mixtures, we explored potential mechanistic links between functional genetic markers for nitrification and ammonification, however we found no statistically significant effects attributable to these genetic markers. We found root area index was significantly lower in A. rubra monocultures than in admixture with P. menziesii. For both P. menziesii and A. rubra, the number of root tips was lower in mixture than monoculture, indicating physical partitioning of soil space as a result of growing in mixture. We documented additive and synergistic effects of tree species identity on above and belowground productivity, and rhizospheric microbial community development in these four tree species.","[Ribbons, Relena R.; Smith, Andy R.; Healey, John R.; McDonald, Morag A.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Ribbons, Relena R.; Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Del Toro, Israel] Lawrence Univ, Dept Biol, Appleton, WI 54911 USA; [Ribbons, Relena R.] Lawrence Univ, Dept Geosci, Appleton, WI 54911 USA",Bangor University; University of Copenhagen; Lawrence University; Lawrence University,"Ribbons, RR (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",rribbons@gmail.com,"Smith, Andy/A-7512-2011; Healey, John R/J-3719-2016; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011","Smith, Andy/0000-0001-8580-278X; Healey, John R/0000-0002-5398-2293; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales through the Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales through the Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment","R.R.R. was funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 through individual Doctoral fellowships as part of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Programme Forests and Nature for Society (FONASO) .

Despite these changes, the driving factors that control shrubification and its future trajectory remain uncertain. Here we used an ecosystem model, ecosys, to mechanistically represent the processes controlling recent and 21st century changes in plant functional type using RCP8.5 climate forcing across North American Arctic tundra. Recent and projected warming was modeled to deepen the active layer (spatially averaged by similar to 0.35m by 2100) and thereby increase nutrient availability. Shrub productivity was modeled to increase across much of the tundra, particularly in Alaska and tundra-boreal ecotones. Deciduous and evergreen shrubs increased from similar to 45% of total tundra ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) in recent decades to similar to 70% by 2100. The increased canopy cover of shrubs reduced incoming shortwave radiation for low-lying plants, causing declines in graminoids NPP from a current 35% of tundra NPP to 18%, and declines in nonvascular plants from 20% to 12%. The faster-growing deciduous shrubs modeled with less efficient nutrient conservation dominated much of the low Arctic by 2100 where nutrient cycling became more rapid, while the slower-growing evergreen shrubs modeled with more efficient nutrient conservation dominated a wider latitudinal range that extended to the high Arctic where nutrient cycling remained slower. We conclude that high-latitude vegetation dynamics over the 21st century will depend strongly on soil nutrient dynamics, diversity in plant traits controlling nutrient uptake and conservation, and light competition.","[Mekonnen, Zelalem A.; Riley, William J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grant, Robert F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Alberta,"Mekonnen, ZA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zmekonnen@lbl.gov,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Mekonnen, Zelalem/M-7144-2017","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Mekonnen, Zelalem/0000-0002-2647-0671","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments in the Arctic (NGEE Arctic) project.

However, the assembly processes and driving factors of soil microbial communities across secondary forest succession remain unclear. Here, we studied the assembly processes of soil microbial communities and examined shifts in soil microbial community-associated functional dynamics across secondary forest succession. Our results showed that the stochastic process was more important in shaping bacterial community assembly throughout the successional process [modified stochasticity ratio (MST) > 50%], while the fungal community assembly was initially governed by deterministic processes (MST < 50%), but there was a progressive increase in stochastic selection as succession proceeded. Soil organic carbon and pH were principal factors for the explanation of changes in the bacterial community structure (total explained 43% change), and tree richness and productivity were principal factors for the explanation of shifts in the fungal community structure (total explained 17% change). The relative abundance of nitrogen transformation and saprotroph functional groups increased gradually with succession, whereas ectomycorrhizal fungi significantly declined. The results suggested that microbial community succession might accelerate the soil carbon and nitrogen turnover rates. Used together, the mechanisms shaping fungal and bacterial community structure are different in secondary forest succession and highlight that those fungi and bacteria are primarily controlled by plant traits and soil properties, respectively. Variations in microbial functional groups provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the soil microbe-driven soil nutrient cycles during secondary forest succession.","[Yan, Guoyong; Luo, Xi; Huang, Binbin; Wang, Honglin; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xingyu; Gao, Honglin; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Modern Agr & Ecol Environm, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mingxin] Heilongjiang Inst Construct Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University; Heilongjiang University; Qufu Normal University,"Xing, YJ; Wang, QG (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xingyajuan@163.com; qgwang1970@163.com,,"Wang, Qinggui/0000-0003-2456-5770","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42230703, 41773075, 41575137]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42230703, 41773075, and 41575137).",NA,74,0,0,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

The study site was contaminated by heavy metals from a zinc smelter that operated near Palmerton, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. C-3 plants only contributed 1.16% of aboveground primary productivity, whereas recently seeded (5-7 year old) warm season C-4 grasses contributed the remaining 98.84%. Analyses of tissue samples revealed that the carbon content of invertebrates and vertebrates did not reflect the composition of the vegetation. Of 135 samples, 48 (36%) had greater than 75% of their carbon from C-4-derived sources, while 32 (24%) of the samples had less than 25%. However, carbon from C-4 grasses passed through to higher trophic levels, as shown by the abundance of predators with a high proportion of C-4-derived carbon. We document three channels of carbon flux through the food web, one based on warm season grasses, now supporting a functioning ecosystem at all key trophic levels, one based on C-3 plants, and a third based on detritus. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that relative configurations of such channels are important to ecosystem stability. Our results suggest that functional groupings of plants based on photosynthetic pathway or other plant traits likely form the basis for food web compartments. By using diverse functional groups of plants for reclamation or restoration, practitioners may be able to aid the development of channels and thereby promote desired ecosystem states.","[Fetcher, Ned] Wilkes Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA; [Agosta, Salvatore J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Agosta, Salvatore J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Stratford, Jeffrey A.; Steele, Michael A.] Wilkes Univ, Dept Biol, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA",Wilkes University; Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Wilkes University,"Fetcher, N (corresponding author), Wilkes Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA.",ned.fetcher@wilkes.edu,"Fetcher, Ned/ABE-9438-2020; Moore, John/E-9802-2011","Fetcher, Ned/0000-0003-2604-299X; ",Wild Resource Conservation Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,Wild Resource Conservation Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"We acknowledge J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that plant functional traits, especially physiological traits, can be successfully derived from hyperspectral images. Plant physiological traits are frequently quantified either as area-based content [mu g cm(-2)] or mass-based concentration [mg g(-1) or %]. However, it remains unclear whether the two metrics of traits can be quantified using remote sensing approaches. We quantified area- and mass-based foliar physiological traits to compare the prediction accuracy of the two metrics based on leaf spectra using partial least squares regression (PLSR) at a grassland monoculture experiment. These two metrics were then scaled up to canopy traits, respectively, based on leaf area index (LAI) and biomass to test their performance at the canopy level. The canopy physiological traits with high prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.60) were selected for mapping using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based UHD185 spectrometer. Biomass and LAI were also estimated and mapped using the PLSR method. The mapped leaf traits (canopy traits divided by the corresponding LAI), were used to explore the relationships between the interspecific and intraspecific variations in leaf physiological traits and ecosystem productivity (i.e., aboveground biomass). The results showed that the retrieval of leaf physiological traits using leaf spectra and canopy spectra or remote sensing was better performed on an area basis rather than a mass basis, especially for the physiological traits related to photosynthesis. Model selection results also indicted that remotely sensed physiological traits (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid, carbon, nitrogen, and leaf mass per area (LMA)) and their intraspecific variations (coefficient variation (CV) for a single trait and functional richness (FRic) for multiple traits) were significant predictors of community aboveground biomass across grassland monocultures. Our study highlights the potential of hyperspectral images for trait mapping and estimating ecosystem productivity at large scales. Our findings also provide a vital insight for disentangling the links of functional traits and intra- and interspecific trait variations to key ecological processes and functions.","[Zhao, Yujin; Sun, Yihan; Lu, Xiaoming; Zhao, Xuezhen; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yihan; Zhao, Xuezhen; Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Long; Sun, Zhongyu] Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences","Bai, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"zhao, xuezhen/GXH-1171-2022; Lu, Xiaoming/AAE-6302-2022","Lu, Xiaoming/0000-0001-7380-0699; Sun, Yihan/0000-0002-0509-1330; Zhao, Yujin/0000-0003-0225-6491","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801230, 31630010]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0604702) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801230 and 31630010).

One way to address this complexity is to track ecosystem processes through the lens of plant functional traits. Elevational gradients with diverse biotic and abiotic conditions offer ideal settings for inferring functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally. However, most studies have focused on differences in mean trait values among species, and little is known on how intraspecific traits vary along wide elevational gradients and how this variability reflects ecosystem productivity. We measured functional traits of the sub-shrub Koenigia mollis (Basionym: Polygonum molle; a widespread species) in 11 populations along a wide elevational gradient (1515-4216 m) considering from subtropical forest to alpine treeline in the central Himalayas. After measuring different traits (plant height, specific leaf area, leaf area, length of flowering branches, leaf carbon isotope (delta C-13), leaf carbon and leaf nitrogen concentrations), we investigated drivers on changes of these traits and also characterized their relationships with elevation, climate and ecosystem productivity. All trait values decreased with increasing elevation, except for delta C-13 that increased upwards. Likewise, most traits showed strong positive relationships with potential evapotranspiration, while delta C-13 exhibited a negative relationship. In this context, elevation-dependent water-energy dynamics is the primary driver of trait variations. Furthermore, six key traits (plant height, length of flowering branch, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, leaf nitrogen and leaf delta C-13) explained 90.45% of the variance in ecosystem productivity. Our study evidences how elevation-dependent climate variations affect ecosystem processes and functions. Intraspecific variability in leaf functional traits is strongly driven by changes in water-energy dynamics, and reflects changes in ecosystem productivity over elevation. K. mollis, with one of the widest elevational gradients known to date, could be a model species to infer functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally. As inferred from K. mollis, the water-energy dynamics can be a hydrothermal variable to understand the formation of vegetation boundaries, such as alpine treeline. This study sheds new insight on how plants modify their basic ecological strategies to cope with changing environments.

It is uncertain if highly diverse vegetation requires more local PFTs. Here, we analyzed how 52 tree species of a megadiverse mountain rain forest separate into local tree functional types (TFTs) for two functions: biomass production and solar radiation partitioning. We derived optical trait indicators (OTIs) by relating leaf optical metrics and functional traits through factor analysis. We distinguished four OTIs explaining 38%, 21%, 15%, and 12% of the variance, of which two were considered important for biomass production and four for solar radiation partitioning. The clustering of species-specific OTI values resulted in seven and eight TFTs for the two functions, respectively. The first TFT ensemble (P-TFTs) represented a transition from low to high productive types. The P-TFT were separated with a fair average silhouette width of 0.41 and differed markedly in their main trait related to productivity, Specific Leaf Area (SLA), in a range between 43.6 to 128.2 (cm(2)/g). The second delineates low and high reflective types (E-TFTs), were subdivided by different levels of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) albedo. The E-TFTs were separated with an average silhouette width of 0.28 and primarily defined by their VIS/NIR albedo. The eight TFT revealed an especially pronounced range in NIR reflectance of 5.9% (VIS 2.8%), which is important for ecosystem radiation partitioning. Both TFT sets were grouped along elevation, modified by local edaphic gradients and species-specific traits. The VIS and NIR albedo were related to altitude and structural leaf traits (SLA), with NIR albedo showing more complex associations with biochemical traits and leaf water. The TFTs will support LSM simulations used to analyze the functioning of mountain rainforests under climate change.","[Limberger, Oliver; Bendix, Joerg] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing LCRS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Farwig, Nina] Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Conservat Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Pucha-Cofrep, Franz; Trachte, Katja] Brandenburg Univ Technol BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, Inst Environm Sci, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Pucha-Cofrep, Franz] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Grp Invest Hidrol & Climatol, Ecuador Calle Paris, Loja 110107, Ecuador; [Fries, Andreas] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Geol & Mine & Civil Engn DGMIC, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador",Philipps University Marburg; University of Gottingen; Philipps University Marburg; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,"Limberger, O (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing LCRS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.",limbergo@staff.uni-marburg.de; jhomeie@gwdg.de; farwig@staff.uni-marburg.de; franzpc@gmail.com; aefries@utpl.edu.ec; cleusch@gwdg.de; katja.trachte@b-tu.de; bendix@mailer.uni-marburg.de,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011; Trachte, Katja/M-7310-2015","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Trachte, Katja/0000-0003-4269-9668; Bendix, Jorg/0000-0001-6559-2033; Pucha-Cofrep, Franz/0000-0002-5556-4028; , Andreas/0000-0001-5357-5682; Farwig, Nina/0000-0002-0554-5128","German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR2730, BE1780/51-1, TR1201/3-1, HO3296/6-1, LE762/17-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Research Unit FOR2730 (RESPECT: Environmental changes in biodiversity hotspot ecosystems of South Ecuador: RESPonse and feedback effECTs).

Using a 7-year grassland experiment in Inner Mon-golian steppe, we examined the relative importance of direct versus indirect (through mediating plant and arthropod biodiversity) effects of four land-use types (growing-season grazing, spring & summer grazing, mowing and enclosure) and precipitation variation in two climatically contrasting years on plant and arthropod productivity. Our results showed that: (1) the variation patterns of species and functional diversity and pro-ductivity across land use types were significantly different between plant and arthropod communities, though both plants and arthropods had their community-weighted mean size (i.e., plant height and arthropod body size) decreased under grazing or mowing; (2) moderate grazing and plant growing-season precipitation enhanced plant productivity mainly via indirectly increasing plant functional dispersion and decreasing plant nitrogen concentration associated with the shift in dominant species, but reduced arthropod productivity majorly by direct grazing damage and less importantly by indirect mediation of arthropod body size; (3) grassland man-agement and precipitation-induced variations in plant and arthropod productivity could be well explained by the changes in their functional traits and diversity, but not species richness. Our results indicate the importance of trait-based method in understanding the mechanisms of management and precipitation affecting plant and arthropod productivity, and suggest that biological traits in multiple trophic groups can be used as efficient indicators in the assessment of grassland ecosystem health.","[Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Zhang, Junzhen; Liu, Jiayue; Wang, Yanan; Guo, Ying; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Zhang, Junzhen; Liu, Jiayue; Wang, Yanan; Guo, Ying; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinmin] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University; Inner Mongolia University; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Li, FY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.;Li, FY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.",lifyhong@126.com,,"Li, Frank Yonghong/0000-0002-5137-8017",Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China [2021ZD0011]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0500508],"Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",The research was supported by the Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China (Grant No. 2021ZD0011 and Grant for Key Basic Research on Grassland Ecosystem Functional Processes and Services of Grassland Ecosystems) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0500508) .,NA,79,0,0,18,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Moreover, soil properties related to nutrient availability were shown to change with plant diversity over time; however, it is not well-understood whether and how such plant diversity-dependent soil changes and associated changes in functional traits contribute to positive diversity-productivity relationships in the long run. To test this, we investigated plant communities of different species richness (1, 2, 6, and 9 species) in a 15-year-old grassland biodiversity experiment. We determined community biomass production and biodiversity effects (net biodiversity [NEs], complementarity [CEs], and selection effects [SEs]), as well as community means of plant functional traits and soil properties. First, we tested how these variables changed along the plant diversity gradient and were related to each other. Then, we tested for direct and indirect effects of plant and soil variables influencing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Community biomass production, NEs, CEs, SEs, plant height, root length density (RLD), and all soil property variables changed with plant diversity and the presence of the dominant grass species Arrhenatherum elatius (increase except for soil pH, which decreased). Plant height and RLD for plant functional traits, and soil pH and organic carbon concentration for soil properties, were the variables with the strongest influence on biomass production and biodiversity effects. Our results suggest that plant species richness and the presence of the dominant species, A. elatius, cause soil organic carbon to increase and soil pH to decrease over time, which increases nutrient availability favoring species with tall growth and dense root systems, resulting in higher biomass production in species-rich communities. Here, we present an additional process that contributes to the strengthening positive diversity-productivity relationship, which may play a role alongside the widespread plant functional trait-based explanation.","[Dietrich, Peter; Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter; Eisenhauer, Nico; Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol Expt Interact Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geobot, Halle, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Dietrich, P (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geobot, Halle, Germany.",peter.dietrich@idiv.de,"Dietrich, Peter/AAL-6987-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012","Dietrich, Peter/0000-0002-7742-6064; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-FZT 118, 202548816, FOR 1451, FOR 5000]; Heinrich Boll Foundation",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Heinrich Boll Foundation,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: DFG-FZT 118, 202548816, FOR 1451 and FOR 5000; Heinrich Boll Foundation",NA,74,0,0,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Based on more than a decade of field measurements in a biodiversity hotspot of southern Ecuador, we implemented plant trait variation and improved soil organic matter dynamics in a widely used dynamic vegetation model (the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator, LPJ-GUESS) to explore the main drivers of community assembly along an elevational gradient. In the model used here (LPJ-GUESS-NTD, where NTD stands for nutrient-trait dynamics), each plant individual can possess different trait combinations, and the community trait composition emerges via ecological sorting. Further model developments include plant growth limitation by phosphorous (P) and mycorrhizal nutrient uptake. The new model version reproduced the main observed community trait shift and related vegetation processes along the elevational gradient, but only if nutrient limitations to plant growth were activated. In turn, when traits were fixed, low productivity communities emerged due to reduced nutrient-use efficiency. Mycorrhizal nutrient uptake, when deactivated, reduced net primary production (NPP) by 61-72% along the gradient. Our results strongly suggest that the elevational temperature gradient drives community assembly and ecosystem functioning indirectly through its effect on soil nutrient dynamics and vegetation traits. This illustrates the importance of considering these processes to yield realistic model predictions.","[Dantas de Paula, Mateus; Forrest, Matthew; Langan, Liam; Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bendix, Joerg] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Velescu, Andre; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Phys Geog, Geosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Philipps University Marburg; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Goethe University Frankfurt,"de Paula, MD (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",mateus.dantas@senckenberg.de,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Dantas de Paula, Mateus/D-7852-2016; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Forrest, Matthew/0000-0003-1858-3489; Bendix, Jorg/0000-0001-6559-2033; Dantas de Paula, Mateus/0000-0003-4350-2572; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Langan, Liam/0000-0002-4765-9510","DFG (German Research Foundation) [FOR2730, FOR 402, FOR 816]",DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the DFG (German Research Foundation) for funding this study in the scope of the Research Unit FOR2730 RESPECT, as well as the previous research units FOR 402 and 816 which contributed long-term data.

Nevertheless, the way root traits respond to environmental factors and consequently influence productivity remains unexplored on large geographic scales. We examined the root traits of exoticSpartina alternifloraand nativePhragmites australisacross China's coastal salt marshes. Using structural equation models (SEMs), we quantified the direct and indirect effects of mean annual temperature, soil nutrients (e.g., soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus), and root traits on aboveground net primary productivity. Our results showed that root traits ofS. alterniflorawere more sensitive to changing soil nutrient availability than those ofP. australis. The SEMs indicated that soil nutrient availability increasedS. alternifloraproductivity by increasing root nitrogen concentration and root length density. InP. australis, temperature could increase productivity by both increasing root length density and soil nutrient-mediated root nitrogen concentration. The studied root architectural trait (root length density) and nutrient trait (root nitrogen concentration) were effective in predicting productivity, whereas none of the root morphological traits (i.e., specific root length, root tissue density, and root diameter) significantly affected productivity. We provide the first empirical evidence that root trait-based responses modulate the effects of climate and soil nutrients on geographic variation in vegetation productivity, but these effects are species specific.","[Liu, Hao; Xu, Xiao; Zhou, Chenhao; Zhao, Jiayuan; Li, Bo; Nie, Ming] Fudan Univ, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Inst Ecochongming,Inst Biodivers Sci,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Nie, M (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary, Inst Ecochongming,Inst Biodivers Sci,Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",mnie@fudan.edu.cn,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010; Xu, Xiao/HHM-9482-2022; Nie, Ming/F-1880-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666; Xu, Xiao/0000-0001-6844-3914; Nie, Ming/0000-0003-0702-8009; Liu, Hao/0000-0002-5096-6343","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1406402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91951112, 41630528, 31670491, ECNU-IEC-202001]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1406402), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91951112, 41630528, and 31670491), and the Institute of Eco-Chongming (ECNU-IEC-202001).",NA,82,11,11,5,81,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,APR,2021,24,3,,NA,,NA,726,737,,10.1007/s10021-020-00546-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00546-z,NA,SEP 2020,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RR2EB,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000565122600002,View Full Record in Web of Science,Milena,sim,,sim,sim,não,salt marsh,"temperate,subtropical,tropical",NA,2,NA,"fine root architectural traits (root length density), morphological traits (SRL, RTD, and root diameter), and nutrient traits (root N and P concentrations)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,"RESULT: The studied root architectural trait (root length density) and nutrient trait (root nitrogen concentration) were effective in predicting productivity, whereas none of the root morphological traits (i.e., specific root length, root tissue density, and root diameter) sig- nificantly affected productivity"

However, it remains unclear whether there are critical transitions or tipping points for the response of plant growth or traits to N enrichment, and how these responses differ to different N forms. We chose the native, perennial clonal grass, Leymus chinensis in Inner Mongolia steppe, and conducted a field experiment, in which six N addition rates (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and five N compound types [NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, NH4HCO3, CO(NH2)(2), slow-release CO(NH2)(2)] are considered. Here, we found that the different N compound types had no significant effect on the growth of L. chinensis. N addition rate significantly increased plant aboveground biomass and leaf nitrogen concentration, whereas decreased leaf dry matter content. The tipping point for N-induced aboveground biomass increase was at 10 g N m(-2) year(-1), and the changes in functional traits were at N addition rates of 20 g N m(-2) year(-1). Our findings suggested that the responses of aboveground biomass and functional traits to N addition were asymmetric, in which responses in aboveground biomass were more sensitive than that in functional traits. The differential sensitivity of aboveground biomass and functional traits of L. chinensis occurred to N deposition highlights the importance of functional traits in mediating ecosystem functioning in the face of N deposition, regardless of which chemical forms dominate in the deposited N.","[Yang, Guojiao; Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guojiao; Liu, Qianguang] Hainan Univ, Key Lab Agroforestry Environm Proc & Ecol Regulat, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zijia] Hainan Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guangming] Changzhi Med Coll, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Changzhi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Qingdao Forest Ecol Res Stn, Natl Forestry Grassland Adm, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Hainan University; Changzhi Medical College; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), Hainan Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Haikou, Peoples R China.;Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Qingdao Forest Ecol Res Stn, Natl Forestry Grassland Adm, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",zhangzijia@gmail.com; zhengpeiming@email.sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,NA,50,0,0,23,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Above-ground plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen (N) content and specific leaf area (SLA), have been shown to strongly relate to ecosystem productivity, respiration and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, increasing plant functional trait diversity has been suggested as a possible mechanism to increase ecosystem carbon (C) storage. However, it is uncertain whether below-ground plant traits can be predicted by above-ground traits, and if both above- and below-ground traits can be used to predict soil properties and ecosystem-level functions. Here, we used two adjacent field experiments in temperate grassland to investigate if above- and below-ground plant traits are related, and whether relationships between plant traits, soil properties and ecosystem C fluxes (i.e. ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange) measured in potted monocultures could be detected in mixed field communities. We found that certain shoot traits (e.g. shoot N and C, and leaf dry matter content) were related to root traits (e.g. root N, root C:N and root dry matter content) in monocultures, but such relationships were either weak or not detected in mixed communities. Some relationships between plant traits (i.e. shoot N, root N and/or shoot C:N) and soil properties (i.e. inorganic N availability and microbial community structure) were similar in monocultures and mixed communities, but they were more strongly linked to shoot traits in monocultures and root traits in mixed communities. Structural equation modelling showed that above- and below-ground traits and soil properties improved predictions of ecosystem C fluxes in monocultures, but not in mixed communities on the basis of community-weighted mean traits. Synthesis. Our results from a single grassland habitat detected relationships in monocultures between above- and below-ground plant traits, and between plant traits, soil properties and ecosystem C fluxes. However, these relationships were generally weaker or different in mixed communities. Our results demonstrate that while plant traits can be used to predict certain soil properties and ecosystem functions in monocultures, they are less effective for predicting how changes in plant species composition influence ecosystem functions in mixed communities.","[De Long, Jonathan R.; Wilkinson, Anna; Pritchard, William J.; Johnson, David; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [De Long, Jonathan R.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jackson, Benjamin G.; Baggs, Elizabeth M.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oakley, Simon; Mason, Kelly E.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bailrigg, England; [Stephan, Jorg G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Ostle, Nicholas J.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Edinburgh; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University,"De Long, JR (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.;De Long, JR (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",j.delong@nioo.knaw.nl,"Mason, Kelly E/K-7924-2013; Stephan, Jörg G./C-1618-2015; Ostle, Nick J/K-6891-2012; Johnson, David/N-3193-2013; De Long, Jonathan R/F-5681-2014; Ostle, Nicholas/E-4847-2014; Oakley, Simon/K-1857-2013","Mason, Kelly E/0000-0003-3426-3178; Stephan, Jörg G./0000-0001-6195-7867; Johnson, David/0000-0002-6724-1648; De Long, Jonathan R/0000-0002-7951-4818; Ostle, Nicholas/0000-0003-3263-3702; Baggs, Liz/0000-0003-2014-2148; Oakley, Simon/0000-0002-5757-7420; Johnson, David/0000-0003-2299-2525","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I009000/2]; N8 AgriFood programme; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I009183/1, BB/I009183/2] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRC [BB/I009183/1, BB/I008969/2, BB/I009183/2, BB/I009000/2, BB/I008969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); N8 AgriFood programme; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Number: BB/I009000/2; N8 AgriFood programme",NA,82,39,40,25,139,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Trait-based approaches have the potential to target specific ecosystem services based on associations between the functional composition of plant communities and ecosystem properties that serve as indicators of those services. The effect of functional composition on ecosystem recovery may depend on the amount of restored plant biomass, itself a supporting service frequently targeted in restoration efforts. Yet, interactions between functional composition and biomass are not formally integrated into trait-based analytical frameworks. We tested the hypothesis that functional composition of plant communities both drives, and interacts with, biomass production to influence indicators of soil functioning and weed suppression across a network of degraded dryland restoration experiments. This networked approach allowed us to identify generalized effects of functional composition on ecosystem recovery across a range of dryland climate conditions. Climate had a substantial effect on ecosystem indicators, with weed cover and soil surface stability increasing in more arid climates, water infiltration increasing with precipitation, and aggregate structure increasing with less freezing. After accounting for climate effects across study sites, we found significant effects of community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values on biomass, particularly a positive effect of leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and of CWM-biomass interactions on other ecosystem indicators. Cover of exotic species was reduced in restored communities with a combination of low leaf dry matter content and high biomass, soil water infiltration increased with lower specific root length and high biomass, and soil aggregate stability increased with higher root dry matter content and high biomass, among other effects. Functional diversity had no significant effects on any ecosystem indicators. Synthesis: The influence of community functional composition on ecosystem properties increases with community biomass, particularly in disturbed or low productivity systems. This suggests that active management should not only focus on trait values that optimize individual ecosystem indicators but also how those functional strategies are complementary or counter to those that increase biomass.

Here, we conducted a functional group removal experiment in an alpine meadow in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over 4 years to investigate the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific variability in plant height for productivity. We split total variability in plant height within each of 75 manipulated communities into interspecific variability (TVinter) and intraspecific variability within a community (ITVwithin). Community-weighted mean height among communities was decomposed into fixed community-weighted mean (CWMfixed) and intraspecific variability among communities (ITVamong). We constructed a series of generalized additive mixed models and piecewise structural equation modeling to determine how trait variability (i.e. TVinter, ITVwithin, CWMfixed and ITVamong) indirectly mediated the changes in productivity in response to functional group removal. Community productivity was not only affected directly by treatment manipulations, but also increased with both inter- and intraspecific variability (i.e. CWMfixed and ITVamong) in plant height indirectly. This suggests that both the 'selection effect' and a 'shade-avoidance syndrome' can incur higher CWMfixed and ITVamong, and may simultaneously operate to regulate productivity. Our findings provide new evidence that, besides interspecific variability, intraspecific trait variability in plant height also plays a role in maintaining net primary productivity.","[Zhang, Li] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, State Key Lab Grassland Ago Ecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shurong] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Minist Educ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Shipley, Bill] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Anhui Agricultural University; Lanzhou University; Hainan University; University of Sherbrooke,"Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Minist Educ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017","Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Shipley, Bill/0000-0002-7026-3880","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770518, 31830009]; Hainan University [RZ2000009932]; China Scholarship Council scholarship; Anhui Agricultural University [rc522108]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University; China Scholarship Council scholarship(China Scholarship Council); Anhui Agricultural University,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770518 and 31830009), and Hainan University (RZ2000009932) to Shurong Zhou, Anhui Agricultural University (rc522108) and a China Scholarship Council scholarship to Li Zhang.",NA,48,1,1,16,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Ecological theory and few observation studies indicate that trees with acquisitive functional traits would respond more strongly to higher resource availability than those with conservative traits. We assessed how long-term tree growth in experimental nutrient addition plots (N, P, and N + P) varied as a function of morphological traits, tree size, and species identity. We also evaluated how trait-based responses affected stand scale biomass production considering the community structure. We found that tree growth depended on interactions between functional traits and the type or combination of nutrients added. Common species with acquisitive functional traits responded more strongly to nutrient addition, mainly to N + P. Phosphorous enhanced the growth rates of species with acquisitive and conservative traits, had mostly positive effects on common species and neutral or negative effects in rare species. Moreover, trees receiving N + P grew faster irrespective of their initial size relative to trees in control or to trees in other treatment plots. Finally, species responses were highly idiosyncratic suggesting that community processes including competition and niche dimensionality may be altered under increased resource availability. We found no statistically significant effects of nutrient additions on aboveground biomass productivity because acquisitive species had a limited potential to increase their biomass, possibly due to their generally lower wood density. In contrast, P addition increased the growth rates of species characterized by more conservative resource strategies (with higher wood density) that were poorly represented in the plant community. We provide the first long-term experimental evidence that trait-based responses, community structure, and community processes modulate the effects of increased nutrient availability on biomass productivity in a tropical forest.","[Baez, Selene] Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Quito, Ecuador; [Baez, Selene] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Museo Colecc Biol, Loja, Ecuador; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol, Gottingen, Germany",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; University of Gottingen,"Baez, S (corresponding author), Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Quito, Ecuador.",selene.baez@epn.edu.ec,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Baez, Selene/0000-0002-7236-6242","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4]; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst [91587171]","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, Grant/Award Number: 91587171",NA,53,40,44,12,118,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In this study, we combined the (i) data collected from more than 840 vegetation plots across a large climatic gradient in China using standard protocols, (ii) data on plant traits and phylogenetic information for more than 2,500 plant species, and (iii) soil nutrient data measured in each plot. These data were used to systematically assess the contribution of environmental factors, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and community-weighted mean (CWM) and ecosystem traits (i.e., traits intensity normalized per unit land area) to EMF via hierarchical partitioning and Bayesian structural equation modeling. Multiple biodiversity attributes accounted for 70% of the influence of all the variables on EMF, and ecosystems with high functional diversity had high resource use efficiency. Our study is the first to systematically explore the role of different biodiversity attributes, including species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity, and CWM and ecosystem traits, in the key axes of ecosystem functions. Our findings underscore that biodiversity conservation is critical for sustaining EMF and ultimately ensuring human well-being.","[Yan, Pu; Yu, Guirui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos] CREAF, E-08193 Catalonia, Spain; [Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, BEECA UB, Barcelona, Spain; [Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven Plant Inst, Leuven, Belgium; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, Jena, Germany; [Migliavacca, Mirco] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Earth Crit Zone & Flux Res Stn Xingan Mt, Daxinganling, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; KU Leuven; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; KU Leuven; Max Planck Society; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Northeast Forestry University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences","He, NP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Martínez, Marcos Fernández/I-7240-2012; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/A-9072-2011","Martínez, Marcos Fernández/0000-0002-5661-3610; Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/0000-0002-9260-3815; he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31988102]; CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research [YSBR-037]; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China [2019FY101300]; la Caixa Foundation [100010434],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China; la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31988102; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2019FY101300; the fellowship from 'la Caixa' Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 100010434; CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research, Grant/Award Number: YSBR-037",NA,100,1,1,67,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Permafrost thaw leads to thickening of the active (seasonally thawed) layer and alters nutrient and light availability. These physical changes may influence community-level plant functional traits through intraspecific trait variation and/or species turnover. As permafrost thaw is expected to cause an efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the soil to the atmosphere, it is important to understand thaw-induced changes in plant community productivity to evaluate whether these changes may offset some of the anticipated increases in C emissions. To this end, we collected vascular plant community composition and foliar functional trait data along gradients in aboveground tree biomass and active layer thickness (ALT) in a rapidly thawing boreal peatland, with the expectation that changes in above- and belowground conditions are indicative of altered resource availability. We aimed to determine whether community-level traits vary across these gradients, and whether these changes are dominated by intraspecific trait variation, species turnover, or both. Our results highlight that variability in community-level traits was largely attributable to species turnover and that both community composition and traits were predominantly driven by ALT. Specifically, thicker active layers associated with permafrost-free peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens) shifted community composition from slower-growing evergreen shrubs to faster-growing graminoids and forbs with a corresponding shift toward more productive trait values. The results from this rapidly thawing peatland suggest that continued warming-induced permafrost thaw and thermokarst development alter plant community composition and community-level traits and thus ecosystem productivity. Increased productivity may help to mitigate anticipated CO2 efflux from thawing permafrost, at least in the short term, though this response may be swamped by increase CH4 release.","[Standen, Katherine M.; Baltzer, Jennifer L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Baltzer, JL (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jbaltzer@wlu.ca,,"Standen, Katherine Marie/0000-0003-0370-2027",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,NA,68,4,5,6,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, experimental evidence of compensatory processes that buffer productivity declines in relation to environmental stress is limited, especially in below-ground settings. We asked whether species richness could stabilize productivity under warming via compensatory responses in root biomass and root functional traits. Methods Using three herbaceous species, we created plant communities composed of four individuals in either monocultures or two- and three-species assemblages. We grew them at three temperatures, simulating current climate conditions, moderate warming and severe warming, respectively. We built mixed-linear mixed models to model plant productivity by species richness and warming and we also analyzed the interactive roles of species richness and warming in species interaction and root functional traits. Results We found that warming reduced both above- and below-ground productivity and shifted the biodiversity-productivity relationship from negative to positive. Productivity reductions were weaker in richer species combinations. Warming ameliorated the strength of interspecific competition below-ground in mixed-species communities by reducing the root biomass of strong competitors, which benefitted root growth of weaker competitors. Conclusions Our results suggest warming can facilitate compensatory responses in herbaceous root productivity across species competition hierarchies. These compensatory processes by which species richness stabilizes plant community functioning emphasize the importance that plant functional diversity has in maintaining ecosystem functioning with climate change.","Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zihui] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hogan, J.

Spatially explicit data of plant functional traits and diversity are essential for understanding biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here we retrieved three morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index, foliage height diversity) and three physiological traits (chlorophyll a + b content, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness) from airborne laser scanning and multispectral Sentinel-2 data, respectively. We found airborne LiDAR-derived parameters corre-lated well with in-situ plot-level morphological data (R2 >= 0.67). For satellite-derived physiological traits, partial least squares regression (PLSR) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.26-0.43, cross-validation with in -situ community-weighted mean (CWM) leaf physiological trait data) than a vegetation index (VI) approach. The remotely-sensed traits were used as input to estimate multi-trait functional diversity (FD) indices in a species-rich subtropical mountainous forest. Finally, we investigated the influence of single-trait CWMs, multi-trait FD indices and environmental variables on remotely-derived aboveground ecosystem carbon stocks (aboveground biomass, AGB) and primary productivity (kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). CWMs of all functional traits were significant predictors of AGB and kNDVI, as suggested by the mass-ratio hypothesis. Morphological FD indices were also important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, indicating effects of complementarity in crown architectures. In best-fit multivariate models, the first principal component CWM of morphological traits and that of physiological traits were the most important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, respectively. The FD index of morphological richness was additionally selected in the best-fit models for AGB and kNDVI at ecosystem and landscape scales. Our work highlights the potential of using remotely-sensed functional traits to assess the relationship between trait diversity and ecosystem functioning across large, contiguous areas.","[Zheng, Zhaoju; Schmid, Bernhard; Schuman, Meredith C.; Schaepman, Michael E.; Morsdorf, Felix] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zheng, Zhaoju; Zeng, Yuan; Zhao, Dan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yuan; Zhao, Dan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","University of Zurich; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zeng, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zengyuan@aircas.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071344]; Joint CAS-MPG Research Project [HZXM20225001MI]; University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB); China Scholarship Council [201704910941],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Joint CAS-MPG Research Project; University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42071344) and the Joint CAS-MPG Research Project (No. HZXM20225001MI) .

Higher plant biodiversity can enhance ecosystem resistance to drought; however, the potential effects of drought on the relationships between above-ground productivity (ANPP) and biodiversity along a natural aridity gradient remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the effects of experimental drought on plant community structure and ANPP during the two different dry years (2015 and 2017) spanning three temperate steppe sites with low-, medium- and high-aridity levels. We also examined the effects of drought and aridity on the associations of plant species (richness and abundance), functional (community-weighted trait means and functional dispersion) and phylogenetic diversity (evolutionary lineages) with ANPP. A structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to elucidate how the drought affected ANPP by altering biodiversity attributes. We found that experimental drought shaped the biodiversity-ANPP relationships, and the biodiversity-ANPP relationships differed among three sites. At the low-aridity site, ANPP was correlated with plant functional traits, whereas ANPP was correlated with functional dispersion, species and phylogenetic diversity at the medium-aridity site. At the high-aridity site, ANPP was correlated with species richness, functional traits and phylogenetic diversity. Compared with 2015, natural drought in 2017 strengthened the associations of species diversity, functional dispersion, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content with ANPP across three sites. SEM further showed that both experimental and natural drought directly decreased ANPP and indirectly decreased ANPP by reducing community-weighted mean of plant height. Synthesis. These results suggest that the aridity increase or drought occurrence is likely to induce the shifts in the associations of ANPP with species and functional diversity, highlighting the important role of water availability or precipitation conditions in regulating the biodiversity-ANPP relationships in temperate steppes. Overall, functional traits related to plant size play a crucial role in modulating the response of productivity to drought across three steppe sites. Thus, to buffer the negative effects of drought on steppe ANPP should pay attention to protect the species with large plant size.

Here, we identified plant species of high importance for productivity (key species) in >29,000 diverse grassland communities in the European Alps, and compared their effects with those of community-level measures of functional composition (weighted means, variances, skewness and kurtosis). After accounting for the environment, the five most important key species jointly explained more deviance of productivity than any measure of functional composition alone. Key species were generally tall with high specific leaf areas. By dividing the observations according to distinct habitats, the explanatory power of key species and functional composition increased and key-species plant types and functional composition-productivity relationships varied systematically, presumably because of changing interactions and trade-offs between traits. Our results advocate for a careful consideration of species' individual effects on ecosystem functioning in complement to community-level measures.","[Brun, Philipp; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Brun, Philipp; Munkemuller, Tamara; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LECA, CNRS, Grenoble, France; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS, CEFE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Mouillot, David; Mouquet, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, UMR MARBEC 9190, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier 5, France; [Mouillot, David] Inst Univ France, IUF, Paris, France; [Mouquet, Nicolas] CESAB FRB, Montpellier, France; [Enquist, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Interdisciplinaire Phys, St Mar Tin Dheres, France; [Ostling, Annette] Univ Texas Austin, Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Institut Universitaire de France; University of Arizona; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Brun, P (corresponding author), Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",philipp.brun@wsl.ch,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; MOUQUET, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [1003A_149508, 310030L_170059]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LAB-56, ANR-15-IDEX-02]; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 1003A_149508 and 310030L_170059; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LAB-56 and ANR-15-IDEX-02; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",NA,60,12,13,15,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

To investigate how distinct species affect ecosystem productivity, we used a forest-gap model to simulate realistic temperate forest successions along an environmental gradient and measured ecosystem productivity at the end of the successional trajectories. We performed 10 560 simulations with different sets and numbers of species, bearing either distinct or indistinct functional traits, and compared them to random assemblages, to mimic the consequences of a regional loss of species. Long-term ecosystem productivity dropped when distinct species were lost first from the regional pool of species, under the harshest environmental conditions. On the contrary, productivity was more dependent on ordinary species in milder environments. Our findings show that species functional distinctiveness, integrating multiple trait dimensions, can capture species-specific effects on ecosystem productivity. In a context of an environmentally changing world, they highlight the need to investigate the role of distinct species in sustaining ecosystem processes, particularly in extreme environmental conditions.","[Delalandre, Leo; Morin, Xavier; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France; [Gauzere, Pierre; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS,LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Cadotte, Marc] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mouquet, Nicolas; Mouillot, David; Loiseau, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Mouquet, Nicolas] FRB CESAB, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LiPhy, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Denelle, Pierre] Univ Goettingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Gottingen,"Delalandre, L (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France.",leo.delalandre@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Morin, Xavier/B-2790-2015; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Morin, Xavier/0000-0003-1961-8700; MOUQUET, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984; Delalandre, Leo/0000-0003-2875-4587; Mouillot, David/0000-0003-0402-2605",Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); Electricite de France (EDF); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plants' [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; BACI [640176],Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); Electricite de France (EDF)(Electricite de France (EDF)); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plants'(European Research Council (ERC)); DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; BACI,"This research is supported by the Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB) and Electricite de France (EDF) in the context of the CESAB project 'Causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales' (FREE).

Multispecies reforestation plantings present a valuable opportunity to investigate BEF relationships in woody systems, especially across large environmental gradients. Location Reforestation plantings across the arable region of Australia. Time period 1951-2012. Major taxa studied Three hundred and sixty-four woody plant species. Methods We examined relationships between productivity and diversity using inventory data from 977 plots in 386 multispecies reforestation plantings. Diversity was estimated using observed species richness and three functional diversity indices calculated from four functional traits: specific leaf area, wood density, seed mass and maximum attainable height. We modelled how plot-level biomass accumulation (a productivity proxy) correlated with these diversity indices, as well as age since planting, plant density and three environmental variables: solar radiation, moisture availability and soil sand content. These models were fitted across Australia and, separately, within eight groups of plantings with similar environmental conditions. Results We found no correlation between diversity and productivity, regardless of the diversity metric or spatial scale used (continent-wide or within environment groups). Instead, productivity was best explained by local environmental conditions and plant density. Main conclusions A positive relationship between diversity and productivity was not evident in planted forests across a wide range of Australian woodland and forest systems, at least in the first few decades of growth. Our findings suggest that the positive relationship between diversity and productivity commonly reported in experimental settings should not be assumed for all systems and conditions.","[Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.; Mayfield, Margaret M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [England, Jacqueline R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Staples, TL (autor correspondente), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",timothy.staples@uqconnect.edu.au,"Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Staples, Tim/AEI-0009-2022; England, Jacqueline R/G-6417-2011; Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; England, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-3371-1509; Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Staples, Timothy/0000-0002-8550-2661",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; University of Queensland,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; University of Queensland(University of Queensland)","This work was funded by a University of Queensland and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant, and T.L.S. was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

We assessed the relative importance of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and identity of neighbors for stem growth 3 yr after seedling establishment in a tree diversity experiment in eastern Minnesota. Generally, we found that community-weighted means of key functional traits (including mycorrhizal association, leaf nitrogen and calcium, and waterlogging tolerance) as well as species richness were strong, independent predictors of stem biomass growth. More phylogenetically diverse communities did not consistently produce more biomass than expected, and the trait values or diversity of individual functional traits better predicted biomass production than did a multidimensional functional diversity metric. Furthermore, functional traits and species richness best predicted growth at the whole-plot level (12 m(2)), whereas neighborhood composition best predicted growth at the focal tree level (0.25 m(2)). The observed effects of biodiversity on growth appear strongly driven by positive complementary effects rather than by species-specific selection effects, suggesting that synergistic species' interactions rather than the influence of a few important species may drive overyielding.","[Grossman, Jake J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.; Montgomery, Rebecca A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University,"Grossman, JJ (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",gross679@umn.edu,"Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Grossman, Jake/0000-0001-6468-8551; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630","Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program [DEB-1234162]; Crosby Fund at the University of Minnesota; Rothman Fund at the University of Minnesota; Wilkie Fund at the University of Minnesota; Anderson Fund at the University of Minnesota; Dayton Fund at the University of Minnesota; department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1234162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program; Crosby Fund at the University of Minnesota; Rothman Fund at the University of Minnesota; Wilkie Fund at the University of Minnesota; Anderson Fund at the University of Minnesota; Dayton Fund at the University of Minnesota; department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Research was supported by the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program (DEB-1234162).

Here, we propose a novel trait-based productivity (TBP) framework, as a core of plant community traits in land areas, to interpret the variation in productivity. We assumed that productivity in TBP is determined by a threedimensional combination of efficiency x quantity x growth length and tested it using data regarding leaf chlorophyll traits (scaling-up community weighted mean) in three grassland transects of the Tibetan, Mongolian, and Loess Plateaus in China. The results showed that 52%, 54%, and 67% of the variations in gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, and aboveground net primary productivity, respectively, were captured by the TBP framework in all grassland transects, indicating that it was applicable for the three environmentally distinct plateaus. Furthermore, it was more fitted to the environmentally stressful Tibetan plateau, with an explanatory power of up to 83%. Compared with chlorophyll efficiency, the chlorophyll quantity which is regulated by climate or regional limiting factors, has dominant roles in influencing the spatial variation of grassland productivity. The TBP framework emphasises the connotation of traits behind community functions and seemed as a potential in ecological estimations and predictions; however, multiple traits should be considered for further improvement in the future.

How ecosystem functioning depends on these measures of diversity can vary from site to site and depends on successional stage. Here, we measured taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and examined their relationship with biomass in two successional stages of the broad-leaved Korean pine forest in northeastern China. Functional diversity was calculated from six plant traits, and aboveground biomass (AGB) and coarse woody productivity (CWP) were estimated using data from three forest censuses (10 years) in two large fully mapped forest plots (25 and 5 ha). 11 of the 12 regressions between biomass variables (AGB and CWP) and indices of diversity showed significant positive relationships, especially those with phylogenetic diversity. The mean tree diversity-biomass regressions increased from 0.11 in secondary forest to 0.31 in old-growth forest, implying a stronger biodiversity effect in more mature forest. Multi-model selection results showed that models including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and single functional traits explained more variation in forest biomass than other candidate models. The models with a single functional trait, i.e., leaf area in secondary forest and wood density in mature forest, provided better explanations for forest biomass than models that combined all six functional traits. This finding may reflect different strategies in growth and resource acquisition in secondary and old-growth forests.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing; Wang, Xugao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, KeyLab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Wang, Shaopeng] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Gazol, Antonio] CSIC, IPE, Ave Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50010, Spain; [Mellard, Jarad] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, F-09200 Moulis, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE); UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","Wang, XG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, KeyLab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China.",wangxg@iae.ac.cn,"Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Wang, Xugao/B-1111-2015; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015","Wang, Xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879; Mellard, Jarad/0000-0003-1824-919X","external cooperation program of BIC, Chinese Academy of Sciences [151221KYSB20130003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301057, 31370444]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (Contrato Formacion Postdoctoral MINECO-FPDI) [2013-16600]; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (FEDER); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; CFERN GENE; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1545761] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1354741] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","external cooperation program of BIC, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (Contrato Formacion Postdoctoral MINECO-FPDI); Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (FEDER); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation; CFERN GENE; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

Ecosystem processes are driven by both environmental variables and the attributes of component species. The extent to which these effects are independent and/or dependent upon each other has remained unclear. We assess the extent to which climate affects net primary productivity (NPP) both directly and indirectly via its effect on plant size and leaf functional traits. 2. Using species occurrences and functional trait databases for North and South America, we describe the upper limit of woody plant height within 200 x 200 km grid-cells. In addition to maximum tree height, we quantify grid-cell means of three leaf traits (specific leaf area, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration) also hypothesized to influence productivity. Using structural equation modelling, we test the direct and indirect effects of environment and plant traits on remotely sensed MODIS-derived estimates of NPP, using plant size (satellite-measured canopy height and potential maximum tree height), leaf traits, growing season length, soil nutrients, climate and disturbances as explanatory variables. 3. Our results show that climate affects NPP directly as well as indirectly via plant size in both tropical and temperate forests. In tropical forests NPP further increases with leaf phosphorus concentration, whereas in temperate forests it increases with leaf nitrogen concentration. In boreal forests, NPP most strongly increases with increasing temperature and neither plant size nor leaf traits have a significant influence. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that at large spatial scales plant size and leaf nutrient traits can improve predictions of forest productivity over those based on climate alone. However, at higher latitudes their role is overridden by stressful climate. Our results provide independent empirical evidence for where and how global vegetation models predicting carbon fluxes could benefit from including effects of plant size and leaf stoichiometry.","[Simova, Irena] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simova, Irena] Czech Acad Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simova, Irena] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sandel, Brody] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.; Michaletz, Sean T.; Boyle, Brad] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Michaletz, Sean T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Michaletz, Sean T.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut UMR 5175, Montpellier, France; [McGill, Brian J.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol Sustainabil Solut Initiat, Orono, ME USA; [Blonder, Benjamin] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Blonder, Benjamin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Engemann, Kristine; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Engemann, Kristine; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Peet, Robert K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Wiser, Susan K.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Morueta-Holme, Naia] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Boyle, Brad] Hardner & Gullison Associates LLC, Amherst, NH USA; [Kraft, Nathan J.

Both propositions have already yielded support but their relative importance and how they impact biomass production in field situations is still not well known. This study therefore tested (i) whether or not there was a close relationship between biomass production and the community-weighted mean trait values (CWM), as expected from the biomass ratio hypothesis, and (ii) the impact of the functional diversity (FDQ) on biomass production, which is expected to be positive according to the diversity-hypothesis. The study considered a range of plant assemblages occurring in a wet grassland and five above-ground and four below-ground plant traits were measured to characterize their functional structure. The effects of species diversity, soil water content, soil nitrogen availability and grazing intensity on biomass production were also determined. We showed that biomass production was not related either to species richness and diversity or to any of the resource and disturbance parameters considered. Conversely, the functional structure was found to explain up to 55% of the variability of the biomass production. The results obtained clearly supported the biomass-ratio hypothesis. Functional diversity was mainly found to negatively impact biomass production with only poor support to the diversity hypothesis. We suggest that such a dilution effect of increasing FDQ on community primary production may be typical of fertile habitats. In order to significantly improve our understanding of the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem processes, further studies should consider plant assemblages that have been shaped over the long term and habitats across a wide range of productivity.","[Chanteloup, Pierre; Bonis, Anne] Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO OSU Rennes 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Bonis, A (autor correspondente), Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO OSU Rennes 6553, Campus Beaulieu, F-35042 Rennes, France.",anne.bonis@univ-rennes1.fr,"Bonis, Anne/AAJ-1009-2021","Bonis, Anne/0000-0001-5034-9575",French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche,French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche,"PC was funded by a grant from the French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche.

However, there is a need for theory and integrated data collection to scale from traits to ecosystems. We assess predictions of a novel trait-based scaling theory, including whether observed shifts in forest traits across a broad tropical temperature gradient are consistent with local phenotypic optima and adaptive compensation for temperature. Location: An elevation gradient spanning 3,300 m and consisting of thousands of tropical tree trait measures taken from 16 1-ha tropical forest plots in southern Peru, where gross and net primary productivity (GPP and NPP) were measured. Time period: April to November 2013. Major taxa studied: Plants; tropical trees. Methods: We developed theory to scale from traits to communities and ecosystems and tested several predictions. We assessed the covariation between climate, traits, biomass and GPP and NPP. We measured multiple traits linked to variation in tree growth and assessed their frequency distributions within and across the elevation gradient. We paired these trait measures across individuals within 16 forests with simultaneous measures of ecosystem net and gross primary productivity. Results: Consistent with theory, variation in forest NPP and GPP primarily scaled with forest biomass, but the secondary effect of temperature on productivity was much less than expected. This weak temperature dependence appears to reflect directional shifts in several mean community traits that underlie tree growth with decreases in site temperature. Main conclusions: The observed shift in traits of trees that dominate in more cold environments is consistent with an 'adaptive/acclimatory' compensation for the kinetic effects of temperature on leaf photosynthesis and tree growth. Forest trait distributions across the gradient showed overly peaked and skewed distributions, consistent with the importance of local filtering of optimal growth traits and recent shifts in species composition and dominance attributable to warming from climate change. Trait-based scaling theory provides a basis to predict how shifts in climate have and will influence the trait composition and ecosystem functioning of tropical forests.","[Enquist, Brian J.; Maitner, Brian; Michaletz, Sean; Buzzard, Vanessa] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Bentley, Lisa Patrick] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [Shenkin, Alexander; Blonder, Benjamin; Salinas, Norma; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Savage, Van] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Michaletz, Sean] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Espinoza, Tatiana Erika Boza] Univ Zurich, Inst Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Zurich, Switzerland; [Farfan-Rios, William] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Farfan-Rios, William] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Secc Quim, Lima, Peru; [Doughty, Christopher E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Goldsmith, Gregory R.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Ecosyst Fluxes Grp, Lab Atmospher Chem, Villigen, Switzerland; [Martin, Roberta E.; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONCIET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Cordoba, Argentina; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, FCEFyN, Cordoba, Argentina",University of Arizona; The Santa Fe Institute; California State University System; Sonoma State University; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of Zurich; Wake Forest University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Northern Arizona University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Carnegie Institution for Science; National University of Cordoba; National University of Cordoba,"Enquist, BJ (autor correspondente), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",benquist@email.arizona.edu,"Salinas, Norma/K-8960-2015; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/AHC-5048-2022; Farfan-Rios, William/J-9881-2015; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Shenkin, Alexander/L-1653-2017; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Shenkin, Alexander/AAQ-4166-2021; Michaletz, Sean/AAO-8175-2021; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015","Salinas, Norma/0000-0001-9941-2109; Farfan-Rios, William/0000-0002-3196-0317; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Shenkin, Alexander/0000-0003-2358-9367; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096; Michaletz, Sean/0000-0003-2158-6525; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/0000-0002-9925-1795; Maitner, Brian/0000-0002-2118-9880","U.K. NERC [NE/J023418/1, NE/M019160/1]; GEM-TRAITS [321131]; T-FORCES [291585]; John D. and Catherine T.

In water-limited regions, the size of annual plants is related to soil resource availability; therefore, inter-annual reorganization of annual plant communities is expressed through shifts in the diversity and weighted mean values of plant sizes. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of plastic changes at the individual plant level vs. community changes (species presence and abundance) as reorganization mechanisms on the one hand, and as shapers of ecosystem function on the other hand, is not known. We investigated reorganization through inter-annual changes in species diversity and functional structure (diversity and identity). Species richness, composition, and biomass were monitored over four years at Lehavim site, Israel, among adjacent topographic sites. All of the sampled plant individuals were divided into categories according to plant size. We calculated the inter-annual changes in productivity and examined the relationships between these changes and various reorganization indices. Reorganization indices based on both functional identity (value of size traits) and functional diversity of the community were strongly related to, and demonstrated similar predictive ability for, inter-annual changes in plant productivity. In contrast, reorganization indices based on community taxonomic structure demonstrated weaker relationships with changes in productivity. Different components of functional structure complemented each other during the reorganization process and their relative contributions to changes in productivity varied significantly among years. The level of expression of different reorganization mechanisms changes markedly among years and expresses the obstacles that limit the ability of the community to reorganize.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Ya'ar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, Newe, Agr Res Org, Box 1021, Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Bengur Univ, Dept Solar Energy, Environm Phys, Blaustein Institutes Desert Res, Sede Boqer Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Bengur Univ, Phys Dept, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Bengur Univ, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Institutes Desert Res, Sede Boqer Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Dept Nat Resources, Agr Res Org, Volcani Ctr, Bet-dagan, Israel",Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Dovrat, G (autor correspondente), Ya'ar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, Newe, Agr Res Org, Box 1021, Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",,,,NA,38,6,6,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2020,221,3,,,,NA,191,204,,10.1007/s11258-020-01005-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-020-01005-4,NA,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,KI8PE,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000511619400004,View Full Record in Web of Science,Rayana,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The control that organism size exerts over physiological and ecological function suggests that allometry could be a powerful tool for scaling ecological processes across levels of organization. Here we use individual plant allometries to predict how nutrient content and productivity scale with total plant biomass (phytomass) in whole plant communities. As predicted by our model, net primary productivity as well as whole community nitrogen and phosphorus content all scale allometrically with phytomass across diverse plant communities, from tropical forest to arctic tundra. Importantly, productivity data deviate quantitatively from the theoretically derived prediction, and nutrient productivity (production per unit nutrient) of terrestrial plant communities decreases systematically with increasing total phytomass. These results are consistent with the existence of pronounced competitive size hierarchies. The previously undocumented generality of these 'ecosystem allometries' and their basis in the structure and function of individual plants will likely provide a useful quantitative framework for research linking plant traits to ecosystem processes.","Kenyon Coll, Dept Biol, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; Kenyon Coll, Dept Math, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Kenyon College; Kenyon College; University of Arizona,"Kerkhoff, AJ (autor correspondente), Kenyon Coll, Dept Biol, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",kerkhoffa@kenyon.edu,"Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008","Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096; Kerkhoff, Andrew/0000-0001-9617-8687",,,,NA,66,78,100,7,125,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

However, identifying the direction of the productivity-stability relationship remains challenging because ecological stability has multiple components that can display neutral, positive or negative covariations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the direction of the productivity-stability relationship depends on the biotic interactions and abiotic conditions that underlie ecosystem productivity and stability. We decipher the relationships between grassland productivity and two components of its stability in four habitat types with contrasting environments and flora.Location: France.Time period: 2000-2020.Major taxa: Grassland plant species.Methods: We used c. 20,000 vegetation plots spread across French permanent grasslands and remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify grassland productivity and temporal stability. We decomposed stability into constancy (i.e., temporal invariability) and resistance (i.e., maximum deviation from average) and deciphered the direct and indirect effects of abiotic (namely growing season length and nitrogen input) and biotic (namely plant taxonomic diversity, trait diversity and community-weighted mean traits) factors on productivity-stability relationships using structural equation models.Results: We found a positive relationship between productivity and constancy and a negative relationship between productivity and resistance in all habitats. Abiotic factors had stronger effects on productivity and stability compared with biotic factors. A longer growing season enhanced grassland productivity and constancy. Nitrogen input had positive and negative effects on grassland productivity and resistance, respectively. Trait values affected the constancy and resistance of grassland more than taxonomic and trait diversity, with effects varying from one habitat to another. Productivity was not related to any biotic factor.Main conclusions: Our findings reveal how vital it is to consider both the multiple components of stability and the interaction between environment and biodiversity to gain an understanding of the relationships between productivity and stability in real-world ecosystems, which is a crucial step for sustainable grassland management.","[Mahaut, Lucie; Garnier, Eric; Renard, Delphine; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, CEFE, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Choler, Philippe; Thuiller, Wilfried; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LECA,Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Denelle, Pierre] Univ Gottingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane] Normandy Univ, UNICAEN, INRAE, EVA, Caen, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Interdisciplinaire Phys, Grenoble, France; [Serra-Diaz, Josep M.] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRAE, Silva, Nancy, France; [Viovy, Nicolas] CEA Paris Saclay, LSCE, Orme Merisiers, Bat 714, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Mahaut, Lucie] UMR CEFE, 1919 route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; University of Gottingen; Max Planck Society; INRAE; Universite de Caen Normandie; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Mahaut, L (autor correspondente), UMR CEFE, 1919 route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France.",lucie.mahaut1@gmail.com,"; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Mahaut, Lucie/0000-0002-5825-3807; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB); EDF in the context of the CESAB project; FRB; EDF; French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; French National Research Agency under the Programme Investissements d'Avenir [ANR 17 MPGA 0004]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.,French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB); EDF in the context of the CESAB project; FRB; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; French National Research Agency under the Programme Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.,"This research was supported by the French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB; ) and EDF in the context of the CESAB project Causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales (FREE), by the FRB, EDF and French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project Functional rarity as a marker of land use intensification and ecosystem functions in French permanent grasslands (FunIndic) and by the FRB in the context of the CESAB project Assembling, analysing and sharing data on plant functional diversity to understand the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning: a case study with French Permanent Grasslands (DIVGRASS).

We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (biomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8-16years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity-biomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity-biomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with biomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.","[Lasky, Jesse R.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lasky, Jesse R.; Uriarte, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Boukili, Vanessa K.; Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Erickson, David L.; Kress, W.

Although direct facilitation has accrued most of the evidence so far, indirect facilitation is ubiquitous in nature and it has an enormous potential to explain community structuring. In this study, we assess the effect of direct and indirect facilitation on community productivity via taxonomic and functional diversity. Methods In an alpine community on the Tibetan Plateau, we manipulated the presence of the shrub Dasiphora fruticosa and graminoids in a fenced meadow and a grazed meadow to quantify the effects of direct and indirect facilitation. We measured four plant traits: height, lateral spread, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of forbs; calculated two metrics of functional diversity [range of trait and community-weighted mean (CWM) of trait]; and assessed the responses of functional diversity to shrub facilitation. We used structural equation modelling to explore how shrubs directly and indirectly drove community productivity via taxonomic diversity and functional diversity. Key Results We found stronger effects from herbivore-mediated indirect facilitation than direct facilitation on productivity and taxonomic diversity, regardless of the presence of graminoids. For functional diversity, the range and CWM of height and SLA, rather than lateral spread and LDMC, generally increased due to direct and indirect facilitation. Moreover, we found that the range of traits played a primary role over taxonomic diversity and CWM of traits in terms of shrub effects on community productivity. Conclusions Our study reveals that the mechanism of shrub direct and indirect facilitation of community productivity in this alpine community is expanding the realized niche (i.e. expanding range of traits). Our findings indicate that facilitators might increase trait dispersion in the local community, which could alleviate the effect of environmental filters on trait values in harsh environments, thereby contributing to ecosystem functioning.","[Wang, Xiangtai; Meng, Lihua; Zhou, Xianhui; Chen, Shuyan; Du, Guozhen; Xiao, Sa] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Michalet, Richard] Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS 5805 EPOC, F-33405 Talence, France",Lanzhou University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Xiao, S (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",xiaos@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830321, 31870412, 32071532, 31670435, 31670437, 41671038, 31770448]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program [2019QZKK0302]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program,"This research was supported by the Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830321, 31870412, 32071532, 31670435, 31670437, 41671038, 31770448) and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program (2019QZKK0302).",NA,51,5,6,11,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Yet the potential consequences of climate-induced plant species losses for the functioning of these ecosystems are poorly understood. We investigated how climate change might alter the functional composition of grasslands for Konza Prairie, a diverse tallgrass prairie in central North America. With species-specific climate envelopes, we show that a reduction in mean annual precipitation would preferentially remove species that are more abundant in the more productive lowland positions at Konza. As such, decreases in precipitation could reduce productivity not only by reducing water availability but by also removing species that inhabit the most productive areas and respond the most to climate variability. In support of this prediction, data on species abundance at Konza over 16 years show that species that are more abundant in lowlands than uplands are preferentially reduced in years with low precipitation. Climate change is likely to also preferentially remove species from particular functional groups and clades. For example, warming is forecast to preferentially remove perennials over annuals as well as Cyperaceae species. Despite these predictions, climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the functional composition of the tallgrass prairie flora, as many functional traits such as physiological drought tolerance and maximum photosynthetic rates showed little relationship with climate envelope parameters. In all, although climatic drying would indirectly alter grassland productivity through species loss patterns, the insurance afforded by biodiversity to ecosystem function is likely to be sustained in the face of climate change.","[Craine, Joseph M.; Nippert, Jesse B.; Towne, E.

Species can have one or both of these mechanisms. They confer resilience, which may determine community composition through differential species persistence after fire. To predict ecosystem level responses to changes in climate and fire conditions, we examined the proportions of these plant fire-adaptive traits among woody growth forms of 2880 taxa, in eight fire-prone ecosystems comprising similar to 87% of Australia's land area. Shrubs comprised 64% of the taxa. More tree (>84%) than shrub (similar to 50%) taxa resprouted. Basal, epicormic and apical resprouting occurred in 71%, 22% and 3% of the taxa, respectively. Most rainforest taxa (91%) were basal resprouters. Many trees (59%) in frequently-burnt eucalypt forest and savanna resprouted epicormically. Although crown fire killed many mallee (62%) and heathland (48%) taxa, fire-cued seeding was common in these systems. Postfire seeding was uncommon in rainforest and in arid Acacia communities that burnt infrequently at low intensity. Resprouting was positively associated with ecosystem productivity, but resprouting type (e.g. basal or epicormic) was associated with local scale fire activity, especially fire frequency. Although rainforest trees can resprout they cannot recruit after intense fires and may decline under future fires. Semi-arid Acacia communities would be susceptible to increasing fire frequencies because they contain few postfire seeders. Ecosystems dominated by obligate seeders (mallee, heath) are also susceptible because predicted shorter inter-fire intervals will prevent seed bank accumulation. Savanna may be resilient to future fires because of the adaptive advantage of epicormic resprouting among the eucalypts. The substantial non-resprouting shrub component of shrublands may decline, but resilient Eucalyptus spp. will continue to dominate under future fire regimes. These patterns of resprouting and postfire seeding provide new insights to ecosystem assembly, resilience and vulnerability to changing fire regimes on this fire-prone continent.

Changes in key traits and functional diversity in Scottish grasslands were analysed for a resurvey of 561 grasslands sampled an average of 40 years apart and these changes correlated with changes in environmental drivers. There were clear differences between the responses of different grassland habitats; more productive habitats showed evidence of increased agricultural utilisation, whereas more unproductive habitats showed evidence of reduced exploitation. This was echoed in an increase in Functional Richness in unproductive habitats and a decrease in productive ones; the latter indicating increased habitat filtering in the heavily utilised, productive habitats. There were also overall shifts to later-flowering species and less availability of resources for pollinators in less productive habitats. Models relating changes in traits to the environment had little power, but did indicate the importance of pollution and that recovery from the peak in livestock numbers between the surveys had not fully worked through. Similarly, changes in functional diversity were poorly explained by changes in environmental drivers, though increased rainfall had positive impacts on Functional Evenness and Richness. Functional Divergence (measured by Rao's Q) was, however, strongly linked to changes in species traits over time. Scottish grasslands have diverged in how they have been utilised; more productive grasslands have been exploited more, resulting in shifts towards species with more exploitative growth strategies, a narrower range of growth and investment strategies, but a reduction in competitive dominance. The less productive grasslands appear to be utilised less, with shifts towards more conservative growth strategies and reduced habitat filtering, and the potential to deliver greater ecosystem multifunctionality. Resource declines for pollinators appeared to be universal across all grassland habitats.","[Pakeman, Robin J.; Hewison, Richard L.; Riach, David; Fisher, Julia M.; Fielding, Debbie A.; Mitchell, Ruth J.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Hurskainen, Sonja] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, Pentti Kaiteran Katu 1, Oulu 90014, Finland",James Hutton Institute; University of Oulu,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk,"Mitchell, Ruth/F-4159-2010","Mitchell, Ruth/0000-0001-8151-2769; Hurskainen, Sonja/0000-0002-2721-4338",Strategic Research Programme of the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division [WP3.4],Strategic Research Programme of the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division,"This work would not have been possible without the many long hours spent in the field by E.L.

However, evidence suggests there will be considerable inertia between climate change and shifts in plant species distributions, for example due to resident communities resisting changes, the redistribution of resident species' abundances, and dispersal limitation of species attempting to track preferred climates. Objectives To test how inertia in community responses to climate change may affect future primary productivity, and the capacity for communities to respond through local redistribution of abundances. Methods We assessed relationships between community functional trait distributions, climate and environment with a remote-sensed measure of gross primary productivity (GPP) across 1032 woody plant communities and projected these spatially under current and future climates. Using a simulation approach, we also tested the capacity for communities to achieve future trait distributions by shifting the relative abundances of resident species. Results We found that climate change is likely to reduce GPP in southeast Queensland, and, contrary to expectations, there is little evidence to suggest distributional inertia will contribute substantially to this loss. We show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well-placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through redistribution of resident species abundances. Conclusions Our results show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through abundance redistribution of resident species, but it is unlikely this will mitigate strong climate change-driven losses of productivity.","[McCarthy, James K.; Dwyer, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [McCarthy, James K.; Mokany, Karel] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2061, Australia; [McCarthy, James K.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Landcare Research - New Zealand; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"McCarthy, JK (autor correspondente), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",mccarthyj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009; Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; McCarthy, James K./E-9801-2010","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; McCarthy, James K./0000-0003-3060-1678",,,,NA,74,1,1,6,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

However, in naturally assembled communities where colonization occurs, resource competition may favor dominant traits, which eventually have the greatest influence on productivity. Here, in naturally developed long-term subalpine meadows (from 4-year to at least 40 years meadows) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we investigated the relationships between species richness and productivity to testify whether positive diversity-productivity relationships can still exist in naturally developed long-term communities. We also measured five functional traits (specific leaf area, photosynthesis rate, leaf proline content, seed mass and seed germination rate) to calculate two functional diversity indices: community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) which are highly correlated to functional traits of dominating species and variety of functional trait among all species. Finally, we quantified the relative contribution of species diversity, functional traits of dominating species and functional diversity among all species to productivity along the succession. We demonstrated strong positively diversity-productivity relationships in the natural sub-alpine meadow communities across time. The five traits of dominating species explained a large proportion (54-80%) of the variation in productivity during succession, whereas species diversity and functional diversity (FD) for each of the five traits explained much less (24-48% for species richness and 0-40% for FD for each of the five traits respectively). We found unequivocal evidence that significantly positive diversity-productivity relationships in the natural sub-alpine meadow communities across time are up to superior performers (dominant traits) in naturally developed communities where colonization occurs. As a result, understanding diversity-productivity relationships under the full range of community assembly processes therefore merits further investigation.","[Jiang, Kai; Tan, Zhaoyuan; He, Qifang; Wang, Lu; Zhao, Yang; Sun, Xinhang; Hou, Weichen; Long, Wenxing; Zhang, Hui] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Eco, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Kai; Tan, Zhaoyuan; He, Qifang; Wang, Lu; Zhao, Yang; Sun, Xinhang; Hou, Weichen; Long, Wenxing; Zhang, Hui] Hainan Univ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Coll Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China",Hainan University; Hainan University,"Zhang, H (autor correspondente), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Eco, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, H (autor correspondente), Hainan Univ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Coll Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",993781@hainu.edu.cn,,,Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project [RH2000008233]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770469]; Hainan University [KYQD (ZR) 1876],Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University,"This work was funded by Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project (RH2000008233), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770469) and the start-up fund from Hainan University (KYQD (ZR) 1876).",NA,39,4,4,11,30,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 7,2020,10,1,,,,NA,,,13353,10.1038/s41598-020-70402-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70402-6,NA,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,NC7XQ,32770030,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000561428300008,View Full Record in Web of Science,Rayana,sim,,sim,sim,não,grassland,temperate,positive,1,SLA;photosynthesis_rate;leaf proline content;SM(seed_mass);seed_germination(SG),NA,NA,ns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change. 2. We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity hypotheses. 3. Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in 200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness, functional diversity and initial stand biomass. 4. Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during drought stress. 5. Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance. 6. In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured by low-rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density. 7. Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity, and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet forests, as stands with 'slow' trait values are 'fast' in terms of productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected; high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.","[Prado-Junior, Jamir A.; Schiavini, Ivan; Arantes, Carolina S.] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Ceara St, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Prado-Junior, Jamir A.; van der Sande, Masha T.; Lohbeck, Madelon; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vale, Vagner S.] State Univ Goias, Forestry Dept, Ipameri Campus,Rd GO 330 Km 241, BR-75780000 Ipameri, Brazil; [van der Sande, Masha T.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon] ICRAF, World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave, Nairobi, Kenya",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Wageningen University & Research; Universidade Estadual de Goias; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Prado, JA (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Ceara St, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.;Prado, JA (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",jamirjunior@yahoo.com.br,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Junior, Jamir Prado/O-5943-2014; Vale, Vagner/AAB-5950-2021; Vale, Vagner/F-3675-2017; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Junior, Jamir Prado/0000-0003-1917-1283; Vale, Vagner/0000-0003-2155-9156; Vale, Vagner/0000-0003-2155-9156; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800; van der Sande, Masha/0000-0002-6845-2308; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875",Fundacao de Amparoa Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [283093]; Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs [KB-14]; Wageningen University;  [KB-14-003-030],"Fundacao de Amparoa Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands); Wageningen University; ","We are thankful for the forest owners for providing permission to work on their areas, our field assistants that help us carrying the data collection and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on the manuscript.

We investigated the relative effects on understory biomass of five categories of ecological variables related to five hypotheses - i) niche complementarity: functional diversity indices of understory plants, ii) mass ratio: community weighted mean (CWM) traits of understory plants, iii) overstory attributes: planted tree diameter, basal area, height, canopy cover and stem density, iv) soil nutrients: soil pH and soil C, N, P, and v) plantation type (an exotic broad-leaved monoculture, a native broad-leaved monoculture and a native conifer mix). Here, understory biomass was studied at two understory layers: high (2 to 7 m above ground) and low (less than 2 m above ground) in the plantations of subtropical area of Southern China. We surveyed vegetation, measured soil nutrients and determined five important leaf functional traits for each species. Multiple linear regression models were performed to select the best models and to assess the statistical significance of the effects of each variable. Our results showed that the best models for predicting biomass in the high (mean = 603.29 g m(-2)) and low (mean = 596.81 g m(-2)) layers were, respectively, the models for canopy cover and functional richness (FRic) interacting with plantation type. Model analyses showed a positive relationship between canopy cover and high-layer biomass (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively in native mixed-conifer and broad-leaved plantations) and between FRic and low-layer biomass (P < 0.001 in both native mixed-conifer and broad-leaved plantations) in the two native plantations. A positive relationship was also found between the CWM of leaf dry matter content and biomass in the high understory layer in the native mixed-conifer plantation (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, soil N was negatively correlated with low layer biomass (P < 0.01). Our study highlighted the dominant role of overstory attributes and niche complementarity in explaining forest understory productivity compared to other hypotheses. The effects of ecological factors on understory biomass varied in direction and magnitude, depending on understory stratum and plantation type. Indeed, the mechanisms behind biomass production in the high and low understory layers appeared to be decoupled. The typical biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship only drove low-layer biomass, while high-layer biomass was influenced by canopy cover.","[Wei, Liping; Rao, Xingquan; Lin, Yongbiao; Wang, Jun; Jian, Shuguang; Ren, Hai] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Engn Lab Vegetat Ecosyst Restorat Islands & C, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Gosselin, Frederic] INRAE, UR EFNO, F-45290 Domaine Des Barres, Nogent Sur Vern, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; INRAE","Jian, SG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Engn Lab Vegetat Ecosyst Restorat Islands & C, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.",jiansg@scbg.ac.cn,,"Gosselin, Frederic/0000-0003-3737-106X; Wei, Liping/0000-0002-4296-9851",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31800455],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No.31800455).
