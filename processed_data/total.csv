Plant functional traits represent species adaptations to specific environments and are considered the key mechanism by which individual species contribute to the functioning and subsequent provision of ecosystem services. This study characterises the Afromontane palustrine wetlands along the altitudinal gradient in Lesotho in terms of plant functional traits and composition. Wetland plant species are classified into functional types (PFTs) using their functional traits. Relationships of plant functional traits and PFTs with environmental factors are also explored. Plant species composition was assessed using the Braun-Blanquet method, while functional traits and environmental factors were assessed using protocols recommended in the literature. The data were analysed using clustering and ordination techniques. Eight PFTs were obtained from the functional classification of the species. The PFTs were dominated by C(3)plants, particularly in high-altitude wetlands. The wetland plant communities in Lesotho exhibited the coexistence of species from different PFTs, highlighting functional differentiation to exploit microhabitat heterogeneity. Both functional traits and functional composition of communities were mainly influenced by altitude, longitude, slope and several edaphic factors. Because montane regions display greater sensitivity to changes in climate, alterations in wetland plant functional traits, PFTs and composition will possibly occur in the face of climate change. These alterations will result in modifications in montane wetland ecosystem functioning that include primary productivity and nutrient cycling, with subsequent changes in the delivery of ecosystem services.","[Chatanga, Peter; Sieben, Erwin J.

We analyze responses of species attributes to diversity level and resource availability, and explore their consequences for ecosystem functioning and ultimately assess the contributions of five traits (vegetative plant height, clonal growth, root depth, cespitose habit and seed mass) to ecosystem functioning defined by spatial stability of community biomass. We found that functional traits disproportionately affected spatial stability. Relationships between species functional traits and spatial stability of community biomass indicated that diversity of vegetative plant height facilitated stability of a nitrogen fertilized undisturbed natural community (NAT), and that of a phosphorus fertilized forb, legume and bunchgrass community (FLB). The clonal growth form was also identified as a stabilizing trigger for a unfertilized undisturbed natural community (NAT), whereas diversity in root depth, cespitose habit and seed mass were related to destabilization of a nitrogen fertilized rhizomatous grass community (RRR).

Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimensional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selection effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.","[Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Coll Ecol & Evolut, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat Guangdong, State Key Lab Biocontrol,Higher Educ Inst, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto; Sun Yat Sen University,"Cadotte, MW (autor correspondente), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.;Cadotte, MW (autor correspondente), Univ Toronto, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.;Cadotte, MW (autor correspondente), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Coll Ecol & Evolut, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat Guangdong, State Key Lab Biocontrol,Higher Educ Inst, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",mcadotte@utsc.utoronto.ca,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693",Canada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [386151],Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This work was supported by the TD Professor of Urban Forest Conservation and Biology chair, Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario Research Fund, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (#386151).

Can we develop a methodology to address plant trait-functioning relationships in species-level units, which are missing from measures of community functional diversity but needed for management? Location: Grazing lands northeastern USA. Method: We measured 53 physiological, morphological and growth traits for 19 plant species from glasshouse and field experiments. We developed a two-step method to link species to ecosystem processes related to management goals of improving desirable forage production in grazing lands in northeastern USA. Results: Species were distributed continuously, rather than clustering into discrete functional types. Grasses, legumes and forbs overlapped considerably in trait values with these common classifications failing to adequately distinguish functional differences. Factor analyses were used to assess variation in species traits, and to rate species for six plant processes through which species contribute to the production of desirable forage. Species performed well in some processes and poorly in others, illustrating complex trade-offs. Conclusions: This methodology provides a foundation for developing tools to guide construction of communities for applied settings, and for assembling hypotheses about plant functioning in mixtures.","[Comas, L.

However, biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning could differ between ecosystem types and evaluating these associations could help assess ecosystem recovery in restoration sites. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of species richness and plant functional traits on ecological processes related to nutrient cycling, productivity and regeneration in subtropical forest ecosystems. The study was performed in three sites (each site containing a reference forest and a forest undergoing restoration) located in the south of Brazil. We collected data on understory abundance, aboveground biomass, litter stock, decomposition, soil feeding activity, litter and soil quality and evaluated the association with tree species richness and plant traits (both community-weighted mean trait values-CWM, and functional diversity measures). Variables related to plant functional traits, especially CWM measures, were associated with most of the ecological processes analyzed. Leaf traits showed the strongest effect on the processes, especially for aboveground biomass, litter stock and understory abundance. Most relationships did not differ between reference and restoration sites. Our results support the mass-ratio theory, suggesting that dominant species traits are the ones that strongly affect ecosystem functioning, and suggest a secondary role of species number on the ecological processes analyzed. Our study provides evidence for the usefulness of functional traits to assess changes in ecological processes in forest ecosystems, with similar patterns in reference forests and forests undergoing restoration.","[Rosenfield, Milena Fermina; Muller, Sandra Cristina] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Ecol Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Rosenfield, MF (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Lab Ecol Vegetal, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",milenarosenfield@gmail.com,"Müller, Sandra/G-3739-2012; Rosenfield, Milena Fermina/D-3110-2019","Müller, Sandra/0000-0002-6316-2897; Rosenfield, Milena Fermina/0000-0002-1799-2822",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [309874/2015-7]; CAPES for the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES for the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank Ana Flavia Boeni, Debora Fonseca, Jessica Schuler and Rene Porciuncula for help in collecting the data and to Suzi Camey for statistical help.

However, how CWM traits and ecosystem functions respond to grazing types and whether the relationships between CWM traits and ecosystem functions mediate the response of ecosystem functions to grazing types remains controversial. In the present study, we set up a seven-year grazing experiment with four grazing types: no grazing (NG), cattle grazing (CG), sheep grazing (SG), and mixed grazing by sheep and cattle (MG) on Inner Mongolia grassland. Nine functional traits of dominant species and five ecosystem functions under different grazing types were determined, and the relationships between CWM traits and ecosystem functions were analyzed. The results showed that the CWM height decreased after grazing, while the CWM nitrogen and phosphorus contents increased after CG. SG caused a greater decrease in aboveground biomass (AGB) and a greater increase in the net ecosystem CO(2)exchange (NEE) of grassland ecosystems than did CG. This result may be partially because the CWM nutrient content and NEE were more negatively related after CG; and the increase in the CWM nitrogen and phosphorus contents suppressed NEE after CG. Therefore, to protect the sustainability of grassland ecosystem functions, SG should be reduced. Additionally, our work emphasizes that the relationships between plant functional traits and ecosystem functions may mediate the response of ecosystem functions to grazing types.","[Wang, Wen; Liu, Huamin; Zhang, Jinghui; Li, Zhiyong; Wang, Lixin; Wang, Zheng; Wu, Yantao; Liang, Cunzhu] Inner Mongolia Univ, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau & I, Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Minist Educ,Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinghui] Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Inst Nat Resource Sci IUNR, Vegetat Ecol Grp, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Wang, Lixin] Minist Educ China & Inner Mongolia Autonomous Reg, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Grassland Ecol Secur, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yang] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Zhang, JH (autor correspondente), Inner Mongolia Univ, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau & I, Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Minist Educ,Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JH (autor correspondente), Zurich Univ Appl Sci ZHAW, Inst Nat Resource Sci IUNR, Vegetat Ecol Grp, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.",wangwen1004@outlook.com; liuhmimu@aliyun.com; 111988017@imu.edu.cn; zylee007@163.com; Lxwang@imu.edu.cn; WZzheng1222@163.com; wuyantao@imu.edu.cn; ywang@imnu.edu.cn; bilcz@imu.edu.cn,"yantao, wu/HMD-1995-2023","Zhang, Jinghui/0000-0002-6217-7376",Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018BS03006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31960243]; Science and Technology Major Project of Inner Mongolia [ZDZX2018054]; Science Technology Project of Inner Mongolia [201802100]; China Scholarship Council [201908155031],Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Major Project of Inner Mongolia; Science Technology Project of Inner Mongolia; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (grant number 2018BS03006); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 31960243); the Science and Technology Major Project of Inner Mongolia grant number ZDZX2018054; Science Technology Project of Inner Mongolia (grant number 201802100); and the China Scholarship Council (grant number JZ. 201908155031).,NA,76,0,0,21,46,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2020,12,17,,,,NA,,,7169,10.3390/su12177169,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12177169,NA,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NP4CZ,NA,"gold, Green Published",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000570126400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, the focus of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments has expanded from the manipulation of plant species richness to manipulating functional trait composition. Involving ecophysiological plant traits in the experimental design might allow for a better understanding of how species loss alters ecosystem processes. Here we provide the theoretical background, design and first results of the 'Trait-Based Biodiversity Experiment' (TBE), established in 2010 that directly manipulates the trait composition of experimental plant communities. Analysis of six plant traits related to resource acquisition and use were analyzed using principal component analysis of 60 grassland species. The resulting two main axes describe gradients in functional similarity, and were used as the basis for designing plant communities with different functional and species diversity levels. Using such an approach allowed us to manipulate different levels of complementarity in spatial and temporal plant resource acquisition. In contrast to previous biodiversity experiments, the TBE is designed according to more realistic scenarios of non-random species loss along orthogonal axes of species trait dissimilarities. This allows us to tease apart the relative importance of selection and complementarity effects on multiple ecosystem processes, and to mechanistically study the consequences of plant community simplification.","[Ebeling, Anne; Pompe, Sven; Eisenhauer, Nico; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Pompe, Sven; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terrestrial Ecol Res Grp, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Baade, Jussi] Univ Jena, Dept Geog, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hillebrand, Helmut] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Proulx, Raphael] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Dept Environm Sci, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Technical University of Munich; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Zurich; Leipzig University,"Ebeling, A (autor correspondente), Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",anne.ebeling@uni-jena.de,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Wirth, Christian/A-4446-2016; Baade, Jussi/D-4281-2013","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Baade, Jussi/0000-0001-9878-7232; Proulx, Raphael/0000-0002-9188-9225",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1451],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The study was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (FOR 1451).

However, the manipulation of functional group richness goes along with major disadvantages like the transformation of functional trait data into categories or the exclusion of functional differences between organisms in the same group. In a mesocosm study we manipulated plant functional diversity based on the multi-trait Functional Diversity (FD)-approach of Petchey and Gaston by using database data of seven functional traits and information on the origin of the species in terms of being native or exotic. Along a gradient ranging from low to high FD we planted 40 randomly selected eight-species mixtures under controlled conditions. We found a significant positive linear correlation of FD with aboveground productivity and a negative correlation with invasibility of the plant communities. Based on community-weighted mean calculations for each functional trait, we figured out that the traits N-fixation and species origin, i.e. being native or exotic, played the most important role for community productivity. Our results suggest that the identification of the impact of functional trait diversity and the relative contributions of relevant traits is essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functions such as aboveground biomass production and resistance against invasion.","[Schittko, Conrad; Hawa, Mahmoud; Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Schittko, C (autor correspondente), Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Berlin, Germany.",conrad.schittko@fu-berlin.de,,"Schittko, Conrad/0000-0002-2200-8762",Freie Universitat Berlin,Freie Universitat Berlin,"Funded by Freie Universitat Berlin.

On the other hand, vegetation function feeds back on the climate system via biosphere-atmosphere exchange of matter and energy. Ecosystem-level observations of this exchange reveal very large functional biogeographical variation of climate-relevant ecosystem functional properties related to carbon and water cycles. This variation is explained insufficiently by climate control and a classical plant functional type classification approach. For example, correlations between seasonal carbon-use efficiency and climate or environmental variables remain below 0.6, leaving almost 70% of variance unexplained. We suggest that a substantial part of this unexplained variation of ecosystem functional properties is related to variations in plant and microbial traits. Therefore, to progress with global functional biogeography, we should seek to understand the link between organismic traits and flux-derived ecosystem properties at ecosystem observation sites and the spatial variation of vegetation traits given geoecological covariates.

Identification of traits that mediate the response of plant species to the environment is well established, but the identification of effect traits and the linkage between the two sets is less developed. This was attempted for a study of eight contrasting land uses in a marginal agricultural landscape where data on vegetation, management controls of the disturbance regime, and soil characteristics, including nitrogen release, were measured simultaneously with measures of ecosystem function such as litter decomposition rates and primary productivity on 30 sites. Trait data were assembled from databases, and an iterative multivariate approach using the three table (species, trait, environment) method RLQ was employed to identify a parsimonious set of traits that predict plant species responses to the environment and a parsimonious set of traits that link vegetation to ecosystem function. The lists of response and effect traits were similar, and where differences were observed, traits were usually highly correlated with at least one trait in the other list. This approach identified a small number of traits (canopy height, leaf dry matter content, leaf size, and specific leaf area) that provide a means of linking vegetation responses to environmental change with changes in ecosystem function. Other response traits included vegetative spread strategy, start of flowering, and seed terminal velocity, but within the system studied these traits were all significantly correlated to the traits shared between the response and effect lists.","Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), Macaulay Land Use Res Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",r.pakeman@macaulay.ac.uk,"Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015","Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133",,,,NA,39,76,76,4,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2011,92,6,,,,NA,1353,1365,,10.1890/10-1728.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1728.1,NA,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,791BD,21797163,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000292633900017,View Full Record in Web of Science,Berga,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,grassland/woodland,temperate,na,,"Bud height,canopy height,canopy structure,flowering start,flowering end,LDMC,leaf size,leafing period,life span,SLA,pollen vector,seed longevity,SM,terminal velocity,varince in seed dimension,vegetative spread,",na,positiva com eixo1,negativa com eixo1,na,na,,,na,ns,na,negativa com eixo1 (*canopy height(,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,ns,,,,,,,,,sim OK,,,,,,,,,,,"este trabalho usou a analise RLQ, uma ordenação com base nas spp, atributos e ambiente.

As a result, the causes of functional group diversity effects are often poorly understood. This paper presents a new process that uses functional trait data to create customized plant functional groups that can be tailored to address specific questions. This method is illustrated throughout with an example taken from a temperate mesotrophic grassland in southern England. LocationSilwood Park, Berkshire, UK. MethodsThe method described applies divisive hierarchical cluster analysis to plant functional trait data (from either field or greenhouse conditions) in order to cluster species into a user-specified number of groups. In our example, this was done using unweighted traits with clear links to C and N cycling. To ensure between-group variance had been maximized, we used a linear discriminant analysis. ANOVA should also be used to compare the mean trait values of groups, in order to make specific hypotheses regarding the effect that each group has upon ecosystem functioning. We compared the resulting groups with the GFL classification to see which was more likely to deliver functionally distinct groups. ResultsThe resulting groups had discrete functional characteristics, so simple hypotheses could be formulated. These groups also appeared to show stronger trait value differences than the GFL classification. Results from the experiment demonstrate that hypothesized removal effects on function were supported, thus validating our approach. ConclusionsThe method described is applicable to a wide range of communities and is able to recognize functionally distinct groups of species. General use of this approach could result in a more mechanistic understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships as it can establish experimentally validated links between functional effects traits and ecosystem functioning.","[Fry, Ellen L.; Power, Sally A.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Fry, Ellen L.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Grantham Inst Climate Change, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Manning, Pete] Newcastle Univ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; Newcastle University - UK,"Fry, EL (autor correspondente), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",ellen.fry@manchester.ac.uk,"Fry, Ellen/S-7483-2018; Power, Sally/I-2923-2012; Manning, Peter/I-6523-2012","Fry, Ellen/0000-0001-7513-2006; Power, Sally/0000-0002-2723-8671; Manning, Peter/0000-0002-7940-2023","Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College, London; Big Lottery Fund's Open Air Laboratories Project; NERC PopNET via the Centre for Population Biology; British Ecological Society","Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College, London; Big Lottery Fund's Open Air Laboratories Project; NERC PopNET via the Centre for Population Biology(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); British Ecological Society","The authors would like to thank A.

Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that ecosystem functioning is strongly affected by the community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and functional traits diversity (FTD). However, little is known about the relative roles of CWM traits and FTD in explaining ecosystem functioning along a grassland restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China. We set up a grassland restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China applying the chronosequence approach. Using community biomass and soil carbon stock (SCS) as proxies for ecosystem functioning, we measured 13 functional traits on 28 common plant species and identified the dominant functional traits through principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed that: (1) Specific leaf area (SLA), mature plant height (MPH) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) loaded on separate principle components, which could be regarded as dominant functional traits to assess ecosystem functioning. (2) The variation of species diversity was not obvious, but FTD changed significantly along the restoration gradient. Following initial increases, FTD, CWM-SLA and SCS then declined, with the threshold occurring at the 18-year restoration. (3) Community biomass increased significantly through more biomass allocation to the below-ground in the latter stage of restoration. Community biomass was significantly correlated with CWM-MPH while SCS was positively correlated with CWM-SLA. We conclude that community-level functional traits are better than species diversity and FTD in predicting ecosystem functioning, and specifically restoration for 18 years could be the turning point for the degraded grassland ecosystem on the Loess Plateau of China.","[Jing, Guanghua; Cheng, Jimin; Hu, Tianming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Grassland & Agr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Su, Jishuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wei, Lin] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Convers, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Henan Agricultural University; Northwest A&F University - China","Li, W (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liwei2013@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,"Jing, Guanghua/0000-0003-1566-6414; Su, Jishuai/0000-0001-7263-2654",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601586]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500700],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41601586), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project No. 2016YFC0500700).

Grazed pasture managers are increasingly being asked to enhance productivity while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts. Using plant traits to design plant communities that optimise ecosystem functions (e.g. productivity, nitrogen retention) may help achieve this. However, trait-function relationships in intensively grazed systems are largely untested. 2. We used a forage diversity experiment, intensively grazed by cows (i.e. 10-12 times per year), to test whether community leaf and root traits were consistent predictors of ecosystem functioning across seasons and dominant species identities. Diversity treatments consisted of adding further species to either a Lolium perenne-Trifolium repens or a Festuca arundinacea-T.repens base mixture. 3. Plant traits were better predictors of functioning in systems dominated by L. perenne than by F. arundinacea. Above-ground productivity, root biomass and soil nitrate concentrations were related to traits in all seasons, but the ability of traits to predict carbon cycling measures, and to a lesser extent, net N mineralisation rates, varied strongly across seasons. 4. Leaf traits were better predictors of functioning than root traits. Despite limited trait breadth, leaf functional trait diversity was correlated with most ecosystem functions in at least one season, but effects were sometimes negative. Trait-function relationships were not always in the expected direction. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that manipulating plant community traits has potential to improve some ecosystem functions for some seasons in intensively grazed systems. However, the variable nature of the trait-function relationships found suggests that a deeper understanding of why and when traits relate to ecosystem functioning is required before managers can be confident that using a trait-based approach will consistently improve outcomes.","[Orwin, Kate H.] Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Mason, Norman W.

We aimed at identifying PFTs within the flora of central-western Argentina, and to explore their possible consequences for ecosystem function. We analyzed 24 vegetative and regenerative traits of the 100 most abundant species along a steep climatic gradient. Based on plant traits and standard multivariate techniques, we identified eight PFTs. Our results confirmed, over a wide range of climatic conditions, the occurrence of broad recurrent patterns of association among plant traits reported for other floras; namely trade-offs between high investment in photosynthesis and growth on the one hand, and preferential allocation to storage and defence on the other. Regenerative traits were only partially coupled with vegetative traits. Using easily-measured plant traits and individual species cover in 63 sites, we predicted main community-ecosystem processes along the regional gradient. We hypothesized likely impacts of global climatic change on PFTs and ecosystems ill situ, and analysed their probabilities of migrating in response to changing climatic conditions. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this kind of approach in predicting changes in plant distribution and in ecosystem processes over the next century.",,,"Diaz, S (autor correspondente), UNIV NACL CORDOBA,CONICET,INST MULTIDISCIPLINARIO BIOL VEGETAL,CASILLA CORREO 495,RA-5000 CORDOBA,ARGENTINA.",,"Díaz, Sandra/ABE-7349-2020; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018","Díaz, Sandra/0000-0003-0012-4612; ",,,,NA,64,566,620,8,302,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Many studies have shown that ecosystem functioning depends on biodiversity, but the role of beta diversity, spatial variation in community composition, is less clear than that of local-scale (alpha) diversity. To test the hypothesis that beta diversity would increase ecosystem multifunctionality through variation in species functional traits, we gathered data on plant community composition, plant functional traits, and seven ecosystem functions across 29 restored prairies. We found that averaged multifunctionality (mean of seven ecosystem functions) increased with both taxonomic beta diversity and functional beta diversity. The abundance of the dominant species, big bluestem, played a more minor role, suggesting a limited role for the selection effect. Neither taxonomic nor functional alpha richness was associated with multifunctionality, though this finding may be sensitive to the identity of the functions included because alpha diversity was associated with some individual functions in opposing directions. These findings suggest that in systems structured largely by natural processes, beta diversity (a patchwork of functionally different plant communities) and dominant species abundance may be more important than alpha diversity in fostering ecosystem multifunctionality. These findings suggest the need for an increased focus on community heterogeneity to reestablish functional ecosystems during restoration.","[Grman, Emily] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, 441 Mark Jefferson Sci Complex, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.; Bassett, Tyler; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.; Bassett, Tyler; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Bassett, Tyler] WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI USA",Eastern Michigan University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Grman, E (autor correspondente), Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, 441 Mark Jefferson Sci Complex, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",egrman@emich.edu; zirbelch@msu.edu; basset17@msu.edu; brudvig@msu.edu,"Zirbel, Chad R/J-7745-2019","Zirbel, Chad R/0000-0002-9289-1722","National Science Foundation [GRFP DGE 1424871, DEB 1552197]; W.

Here, four species traits and aboveground biomass production (ABP) were considered. We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1) community weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FDQ) to evaluate the effects of functional diversity on the ABP in the Northern Tibetan alpine grasslands. Both species and functional diversity were positively related to the ABP. Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for the ABP than species diversity and FDQ, indicating a primary dependence of ecosystem property on the identity of dominant species in our study system. Multivariate functional diversity was ineffective in predicting ecosystem function due to the trade-offs among different traits or traits selection criterions. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving the BEF relationships in stressed ecosystems, and especially emphasizes that abiotic and biotic factors affect the BEF relationships in alpine grasslands.","[Zhu, Juntao; Zhang, Yangjian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Lhasa Plateau Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhang, Yangjian] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology","Zhu, JT (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Lhasa Plateau Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhujt@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019",,973 Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013CB956302]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571195]; West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Construction Service Program for Cultivating Unique Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [TSYSJ05]; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System,973 Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); West Light Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Construction Service Program for Cultivating Unique Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System,"We are grateful to Dr. Yanbin Jiang, Jian Tao, Xiaoyong Yuan, and Yongqi Huang for offering their help on field investigation in the Northern Tibetan Plateau.

Improving our understanding of links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across large spatial scales and rapid global change is a major priority to help identify management responses that will retain: diverse functioning systems. Here we address this challenge by linking projected changes in plant community composition and functional attributes (height, leaf area, seed mass) under climate change across Tasmania, Australia. Using correlative community-level modeling, we found that projected changes in plant community composition were not consistently related to projected changes in community mean trait values. In contrast, we identified specific mechanisms through which alternative combinations of projected functional and compositional change across Tasmania could be realized, including loss/replacement of functionally similar species (lowland grasslands/grassy woodlands) and loss of a small number of functionally unique species (lowland forests). Importantly, we demonstrate how these linked projections of change in community composition and functional attributes can be utilized to inform specific management actions that may assist in maintaining diverse, functioning ecosystems under climate change.","[Mokany, Karel; Thomson, Joshua J.; Ferrier, Simon] CSIRO Land & Water Flagship, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Thomson, Joshua J.; Lynch, A.

However, when three components of diversity were included in the multiple regression analyses, the results showed that functional group diversity and functional diversity had more important effects on productivity and resource use efficiency. These results suggested that, compared with species number, functional differences among species and the range of functional traits carried by plants are the basis of biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. These diversity effects of increasing functional group diversity or functional diversity were likely because species differing greatly in size, life form, phenology and capacity to capture and use resources efficiently in diverse communities realize complementary resource use in temporal, spatial, and biological ways.","Lanzhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, PRC, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Minist Agr, Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst,PRC, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs,"Wang, G (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Arid & Grassland Ecol, PRC, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wangg@lzu.edu.cn,,,,,,NA,39,14,21,12,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Using ecosystem photosynthetic capacity as an example, we first provide an objective approach to derive robust EFP estimates from gross primary productivity (GPP) obtained from eddy covariance flux measurements. Second, we investigate the impact of synchronizing EFPs and plant functional traits in time and space to evaluate their relationships, and the extent to which we can benefit from global plant trait databases to explain the variability of ecosystem photosynthetic capacity. Finally, we identify a set of plant functional traits controlling ecosystem photosynthetic capacity at selected sites. Suitable estimates of the ecosystem photosynthetic capacity can be derived from light response curve of GPP responding to radiation (photosynthetically active radiation or absorbed photosynthetically active radiation). Although the effect of climate is minimized in these calculations, the estimates indicate substantial interannual variation of the photosynthetic capacity, even after removing site-years with confounding factors like disturbance such as fire events. The relationships between foliar nitrogen concentration and ecosystem photosynthetic capacity are tighter when both of the measurements are synchronized in space and time. When using multiple plant traits simultaneously as predictors for ecosystem photosynthetic capacity variation, the combination of leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio with leaf phosphorus content explains the variance of ecosystem photosynthetic capacity best (adjusted R-2 = 0.55). Overall, this study provides an objective approach to identify links between leaf level traits and canopy level processes and highlights the relevance of the dynamic nature of ecosystems. Synchronizing measurements of eddy covariance fluxes and plant traits in time and space is shown to be highly relevant to better understand the importance of intra-and interspecific trait variation on ecosystem functioning.","[Musavi, Talie;

In this context, plant functional traits could help to achieve this goal, as they directly affect ecosystem processes. Thus, modeling species composition based on species functional traits could provide ways to make predictions about future communities and to assess the functioning of the ecosystem. In order to evaluate how different restored communities are from their reference ecosystem, we used a trait-based modeling approach that predicts relative abundances of a community based on the functional composition of the reference ecosystem. We surveyed adult trees in the canopy and seedlings in the understory in both reference and 10 year-old restoration sites in two different locations in South of Brazil to gather information of species composition and their relative abundances. Functional composition was based on information of leaf traits for all species included in the survey. We applied the model on two different components: canopy and understory species. We found differences in functional composition between the restored communities and the reference sites, indicating that the ten-year old restored forests are still not similar to the reference ecosystem. Both the observed and the predicted understory communities were more similar to the reference ecosystem than the observed canopy communities. It indicates that species that established after restoration interventions have functional composition closer to the reference ecosystem than the set of species initially selected for planting. Modeling the community based on functional trait composition coupled with long-term monitoring of sites undergoing restoration would enable a better evaluation of restoration trajectories and management needs to modify ecosystem functions towards values found in reference sites. Restoration should focus on the recovery of functional composition, which would provide a better set of resources for organisms and promote changes in ecosystem processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, however, ecological restoration is conceived as the complete recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem performance. Here, we review the use of plant-plant facilitation as a tool to restore both diversity and ecosystem functions. Facilitation is an ecological interaction between a nurse species, which is able to colonize a stressful habitat and modify the microenvironment beneath its canopy, and the beneficiary species that are not so stress-tolerant and grow under the nurse. Differences in the establishment niche between the nurse and its beneficiaries imply that species sharing facilitative interactions have different functional traits, and can therefore coexist. This process increases, at the landscape scale, all taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic plant diversity. Plant diversity patterns further permeate into those of consumers and decomposers. Thus, restoration based on plant-plant facilitation allows the recovery of multiple facets of diversity at several trophic levels and, eventually, the restoration of essential ecosystem functions (fertility, productivity, or decomposition). We illustrate these cascading effects in the text by means of observational surveys in natural ecosystems governed by facilitation, as well as manipulative experiments and restoration activities.","[Navarro-Cano, J.

Scaling traits to community scales for predicting ecosystem functions (i.e., GPP) remain challenging, while it is promising and well appreciated with the rapid development of trait-based ecology. In this study, we aim to integrate multiple plant traits with the recently developed trait-based productivity (TBP) theory, verify it via Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM) and complementary independent effect analysis. We further distinguish the relative importance of different traits in explaining the variation in GPP. We apply the TBP theory based on plant community traits to a multi-trait dataset containing more than 13,000 measurements of approximately 2,500 species in Chinese forest and grassland systems. Remarkably, our SEM accurately predicts variation in annual and monthly GPP across China (R-2 values of 0.87 and 0.73, respectively). Plant community traits play a key role. This study shows that integrating multiple plant functional traits into the TBP theory strengthens the quantification of ecosystem primary productivity variability and further advances understanding of the trait-productivity relationship. Our findings facilitate integration of the growing plant trait data into future ecological models. Integration of plant functional traits into trait-based productivity theory helps quantify primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng; Xu, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng; Xu, Li] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Yu, Kailiang] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ USA; [Yu, Kailiang] Princeton Univ, High Meadows Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ USA; [Xu, Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Earth Crit Zone & Flux Res Stn Xingan Mt, Daxinganling 165200, Peoples R China; [Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven Plant Inst, Leuven, Belgium","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; KU Leuven; Northeast Forestry University - China; Princeton University; Princeton University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; KU Leuven","He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China.",henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953","National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFF080210102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42141004, 31988102]; CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research [YSBR-037]; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China [2019FY101300]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Project for Young Scientists in Basic Research; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China,"We thank all the members who have participated in field investigation over the eight years to assist us in collecting the data.

Yet, it remains unclear how and which plant traits regulate the assembly process and thus affect ecosystem structure and function under climate changes. Here, we selected six steppe sites with snow fences along a precipitation gradient in inner Mongolia. We measured traits including plant height and leaf carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. We incorporated intraspecific trait variation to quantify the strength of external filters (assembly processes outside the community at a larger spatial scale), the strength of internal filters (assembly processes within the local community), and functional redundancy (the number of species having a similar function to an ecosystem). We applied these assembly rules to explain the changes in biodiversity and productivity in response to changing precipitation. We found that increased rainfall reduced plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) concentrations, but did not affect plant height. High snowfall increased phosphorous concentration, but did not affect other traits. Latent variable models identified climate (rainfall) and soil nutrient conditions (soil total N and P content) were more important than external filtering processes in predicting species richness. However, external filtering processes were the most important predictor of productivity. More specifically, we found with the increase in steppe productivity, the strength of the external filtering on leaf N increased and on plant height decreased, leading to leaf N converging into a small range but broadening the range of plant height. The internal filters had no significant effects on species richness or productivity. Additionally, we found that low precipitation reduced functional redundancy. We emphasize that intraspecific trait-variation drives plant productivity and richness responses to precipitation changes by regulating community assemblage. Our finding also underlines the importance to separate the contributions of different functional traits in regulating the responses of ecosystem structure and function to climate changes.","[Deng, Meifeng; Liu, Weixing; Li, Ping; Jia, Zhou; Yang, Sen; Guo, Lulu; Wang, Zhenhua; Liu, Lingli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Deng, Meifeng; Liu, Weixing; Li, Ping; Jia, Zhou; Yang, Sen; Guo, Lulu; Wang, Zhenhua; Liu, Lingli] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Li, Shaopeng] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; East China Normal University","Liu, LL (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Liu, LL (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",lingli.liu@ibcas.ac.cn,"Liu, Lingli/A-7771-2008; Li, Shao-peng/C-3983-2016","Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151; Li, Shao-peng/0000-0002-1730-3433","Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research [2019YFA0607302, 2017YFC0503900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31700420, 31670478, 31988102]",Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was financially supported by the Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research (2019YFA0607302, 2017YFC0503900), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31700420, 31670478, 31988102).",NA,47,4,5,11,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,AUG,2021,12,8,,,,NA,,,e03707,10.1002/ecs2.3707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3707,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UG7VB,NA,gold,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000689453800035,View Full Record in Web of Science,Berga,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,grassland,temperada,na,,"plant height, LNC,LPC,LCC",na,na,na,na,positiva,,,na,na,ns,negativa,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,,,,,,,,,sim OK,,,,,,,,,,,"este trabalho usou análise de caminhos para avaliar drivers da produtividade.

Synthesizing the existing knowledge on functional trait-based restoration is thus a timely and important challenge. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess how ecosystem services are associated to functional traits across organisms, ecosystem types, and continents. We also assessed the existing trait-based frameworks to target ecosystem services in restoration ecology. Then, we discussed future perspectives for the field, especially the challenges of applying trait-based frameworks in megadiverse tropical ecosystems, which have ambitious restoration commitments. Most papers focused on plants (72%), terrestrial habitats (69%), and non-tropical ecosystems (68%) and monitored ecosystem services and functional traits after restoration started rather than using them as previous targets. Only 12% of the papers targeted the restoration of both services and traits a priori, and 3.8% presented a clear trait-based framework to target ecosystem services in restoration. The possibility of selecting alternative subsets of complementary species in their provisioning of ecosystem services should make functional restoration more feasible than traditional approaches in species-rich tropical ecosystems. With this review and our critical insights on the perspectives of applying functional trait-based restoration widely, we hope to assist broad-scale restoration programs to obtain higher levels of benefits for nature and human well-being per unit of area undergoing restoration, going beyond the area-based approach that has dominated restoration commitments.","[Carlucci, Marcos B.] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Bot, Lab Ecol Func Comunidades LABEF, BR-81531980 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Brancalion, Pedro H.

I report on an experiment conducted in a New England grassland ecosystem that quantified the net effects of a sit-and-wait and an actively hunting spider species on the plant composition and functioning of a New England grassland ecosystem. I manipulated predator functional diversity by varying the dominance ratio of the two predator species among five treatments using a replacement series design. Experimentation revealed that predator functional diversity effects propagated down the live plant-based chain to affect the levels of plant diversity, and plant litter quality, elemental cycling, and production. Moreover, many of these effects could be approximately by the weighted average of the individual predator species effects, suggesting that this kind of predator diversity effect on ecosystems is not highly nonlinear.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06515 USA",Yale University,"Schmitz, OJ (autor correspondente), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06515 USA.",oswald.schmitz@yale.edu,,,NSF [DEB 0515014],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank B.

However, few studies show the effects of plant functional diversity induced by grazing disturbance and environmental changes on above-ground plant biomass (AGB) and belowground root biomass (BGB) in semiarid grasslands. We examined the effects of long-term grazing on plant functional diversity across four grassland types (meadow, steppe, scattered tree grassland and sandy grassland) in Horqin grassland, Northern China. The structural equation model (SEM) was used to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of long-term grazing, soil properties and functional diversity reflected by the single-trait (community-weighted mean) and multi-trait (functional dispersion, FDis) on AGB and BGB across four grassland types. We found that long-term grazing significantly decreased plant height and FDis, while the responses of leaf traits to grazing differed among four grassland types. The correlation analyses showed that AGB and BGB were negatively associated with grazing and positively associated with plant height, FDis, soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The SEM results indicated that AGB was directly affected by grazing, soil N, plant height and perennial richness, and BGB was directly affected by grazing, soil N, soil water content and elevation. Grazing and soil N also indirectly affected AGB through their effects on plant height and FDis. Effect of plant height on aboveground plant biomass was direct rather than indirect, while FDis acted indirectly through its effect on perennial richness, thereby lending more support to the mass ratio hypothesis. Our results clearly highlight the critical role of plant functional diversity induced by grazing and soil properties in affecting AGB in a semiarid grassland ecosystem. So, we recommend considering the linkages of plant functional diversity with ecosystem function in assessing the effects of grazing and soil changes on grassland ecosystems.","[Zuo, Xiaoan; Zhang, Jing; Lv, Peng; Wang, Shaokun; Yang, Yang; Yue, Xiyuan; Chen, Min; Qu, Hao; Liu, Lianxu; Ma, Xujun] Chinese Acad Sci, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Wang, Shaokun; Zhou, Xin; Li, Yulin; Lian, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Zuo, XA (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",zuoxa@izb.ac.cn,,"Zuo, Xiaoan/0000-0002-1063-1100","Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [41622103, 41571106]; National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2016YFC0500506, 2016YFC0500907]",Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan of China,This study was supported by the Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41622103 and 41571106) and the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2016YFC0500506 and 2016YFC0500907).

Vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes, such as aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), are increasingly being modeled as a function of the quantitative traits of species, which are used as proxies for photosynthetic rates and nutrient and water-use efficiency. These approaches rely on an assumption that a certain trait value consistently confers a specific function or response under given environmental conditions. Here, we provide a critical test of this idea and evaluate whether the functional traits that drive the well-known relationship between precipitation and ANPP differ between systems with distinct biogeographic histories and species assemblages. Specifically, we compared grasslands spanning a broad precipitation gradient (similar to 200-1,000 mm/y) in North America and South Africa that differ in the relative representation and abundance of grass phylogenetic lineages. We found no significant difference between the regions in the positive relationship between annual precipitation and ANPP, yet the trait values underlying this relationship differed dramatically. Our results challenge the trait-based approach to predicting ecosystem function by demonstrating that different combinations of functional traits can act to maximize ANPP in a given environmental setting. Further, we show the importance of incorporating biogeographic and phylogenetic history in predicting community and ecosystem properties using traits.","[Forrestel, Elisabeth J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Viticulture & Enol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Forrestel, Elisabeth J.; Donoghue, Michael J.; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Edwards, Erika J.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Jetz, Walter] Imperial Coll London, Div Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [du Toit, Justin C.

In this study, we sought to reveal the relationship between trait variability and grazing management on typical steppe in Inner Mongolia, and explore the implications of this relationship for ecosystem functioning. We measured aboveground biomass and 18 functional traits of the most abundant plant species in a grassland subject to three grazing-management regimes: long-term grazing, short-term grazing exclusion (since 2008) and long-term grazing exclusion (since 1956). Principal component analysis of the variation in species-level traits revealed trade-offs between the traits that enabled rapid acquisition of resources by fast-growing annual species and those that promoted conservation of resources by perennial grasses, especially Stipa grandis. However, there was no systematic pattern of intra-specific variation in trait values recorded among sites. Aggregation of plant functional traits to the community level revealed a gradient of responses of typical steppe to grazing exclusion. Long-term grazing favoured species whose traits indicate low forage quality and relatively low growth rate. Exclusion of grazing for several years favoured species whose traits indicate relatively high growth rate and high capacity to acquire resources. Exclusion of grazing for several decades favoured species whose morphological and physiological traits indicated low growth rates and high capacity for resource conservation. These community-level traits imply that ecosystem carbon and nutrient stores will change in response to the grazing regime. Long-term grazing will result in decreased plant carbon and nitrogen content, and will lead to carbon and nutrient loss, whereas short-term and long-term grazing exclusion are beneficial to the recovery of carbon and nutrient storage. The findings support the value of community aggregated traits as indicators of environmental or management change and for explaining changes in ecosystem function.","[Zhang, Jinghui; Huang, Yongmei; Chen, Huiying; Gong, Jirui; Qi, Yu; Li, Engui; Wu, Xiuchen] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Huang, YM (autor correspondente), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Nat Resources, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",ymhuang@bnu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Jinghui/0000-0002-6217-7376","National Science Foundation of China [NSFC 41371069, 41130640, 41321001]; National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China [2013BAC09B03]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China,"This study was supported financially by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC 41371069, 41130640 and 41321001), and the National Key Project of Scientific and Technical Supporting Program of China (2013BAC09B03).",NA,67,11,18,10,88,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1036-9872,1834-7541,,RANGELAND J,Rangeland J.,,2018,40,2,,,SI,NA,179,189,,10.1071/RJ16086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ16086,NA,,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GG1HC,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000432437000012,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, how different aspects of biodiversity relate to multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) across heterogeneous landscapes, and how the magnitude of biodiversity, dominant species, and environmental effects on functioning compare, remain poorly understood. We compared relationships between plant phylogenetic, functional, and taxonomic diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality across 29 restored grasslands. Functional diversity was positively associated with multifunctionality, more strongly than other diversity measures; however, landscape composition explained nearly four times more variation in multifunctionality than did functional diversity, with plots within human-modified landscapes supporting lower multifunctionality. Individual functions were typically more strongly correlated with environmental variables than with diversity. We also found that abundance of the dominant species, Andropogon gerardii, was positively correlated with multifunctionality. Plant diversity, dominant species, and underlying environmental conditions underpin ecosystem multifunctionality in grasslands, but how biodiversity is measured matters for the strength and direction of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. Finally, in natural systems environmental variation unrelated to local biodiversity is important for determining ecosystem functioning.","[Zirbel, Chad R.; Bassett, Tyler; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.; Bassett, Tyler; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Grman, Emily] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Bassett, Tyler] WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Eastern Michigan University,"Zirbel, CR (autor correspondente), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Zirbel, CR (autor correspondente), Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Zirbel, CR (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",crzirbel@gmail.com,"Zirbel, Chad R/J-7745-2019","Zirbel, Chad R/0000-0002-9289-1722",W.

It is already well established that soil communities drive essential ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, decomposition, or carbon storage. However, knowledge of how plant diversity affects belowground community structure is limited. Such knowledge can be gained from studying the main plant functional traits that modulate plant community effects on soil fauna. Here, we used a grassland experiment manipulating plant species richness and plant functional diversity to explore the effects of community-level plant traits on soil meso- and macrofauna and the trophic structure of soil fauna by differentiating predators and prey. The functional composition of plant communities was described by six plant traits related to spatial and temporal resource use: plant height, leaf area, rooting depth, root length density, growth start, and flowering start. Community-Weighted Means (CWMs), Functional Dissimilarity (FDis), and Functional Richness (FRic) were calculated for each trait. Community-level plant traits better explained variability in soil fauna than did plant species richness. Notably, each soil fauna group was affected by a unique set of plant traits. Moreover, the identity of plant traits (CWM) explained more variance of soil fauna groups than trait diversity. The abundances of soil fauna at the lower trophic levels were better explained by community-level plant traits than higher trophic levels soil fauna groups. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of the identity of different plant functional traits in driving the diversity and trophic structure of soil food communities.","[Beugnon, Remy; Steinauer, Katja; Barnes, Andrew D.; Roscher, Christiane; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Beugnon, Remy; Steinauer, Katja; Barnes, Andrew D.; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Steinauer, Katja] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Barnes, Andrew D.] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Ebeling, Anne] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Waikato; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Beugnon, R (autor correspondente), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.;Beugnon, R (autor correspondente), Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany.",remy.beugnon@idiv.de,"Beugnon, Rémy/ABE-6063-2020; Barnes, Andrew/AAQ-9592-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012","Beugnon, Rémy/0000-0003-2457-5688; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0002-6499-381X; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720",,,,NA,85,5,5,36,103,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"125 LONDON WALL, LONDON EC2Y 5AS, ENGLAND",0065-2504,,978-0-08-102912-1,ADV ECOL RES,Adv.

There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.","Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba; National University of Cordoba,"Diaz, S (autor correspondente), Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, Casilla Correo 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",sdiaz@com.uncor.edu,"Díaz, Sandra/ABE-7349-2020; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018","Díaz, Sandra/0000-0003-0012-4612; ",,,,NA,60,2080,2315,88,1366,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

The response-and-effect trait framework provides a conceptual foundation for translating restoration goals into functional trait targets, but a quantitative framework has been lacking for translating trait targets into assemblages of species that practitioners can actually manipulate. This study describes new trait-based models that can be used to generate ranges of species abundances to test theories about which traits, which trait values and which species assemblages are most effective for achieving functional outcomes. These models are generalisable, flexible tools that can be widely applied across many terrestrial ecosystems. Examples illustrate how the framework generates assemblages of indigenous species to (1) achieve desired community responses by applying the theories of environmental filtering, limiting similarity and competitive hierarchies, or (2) achieve desired effects on ecosystem functions by applying the theories of mass ratios and niche complementarity. Experimental applications of this framework will advance our understanding of how to set functional trait targets to achieve the desired restoration goals. A trait-based framework provides restoration ecology with a robust scaffold on which to apply fundamental ecological theory to maintain resilient and functioning ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Dept Biol Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Waikato,"Laughlin, DC (autor correspondente), Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",d.laughlin@waikato.ac.nz,,,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund [UOW1201],Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"I thank Jon Bakker, Pete Fule, David Hooper, three anonymous reviewers and the staff and students in the Plant Biology and Ecology laboratory at the University of Waikato for providing insightful comments that substantially improved the manuscript.

Although much research has explored changes in ecosystem functions associated with global environmental changes, the mechanistic pathways behind the observed changes remain poorly understood. 2. Using an 11-year experiment that increased growing season precipitation and nitrogen deposition in a temperate steppe, we explored the relative importance of direct and indirect environmental change effects on plant primary productivity. 3. We show that increases in water and nitrogen availability influenced plant productivity via both direct and indirect pathways. While both treatments stimulated plant productivity, changes in plant productivity cannot be explained by observed changes in species or phylogenetic diversity. Instead, the indirect effects of water and nitrogen addition were through their positive effects on plant functional diversity. Importantly, while the increase in one component of functional diversity (community-level weighted mean of plant stature) resulted in increased productivity, the increase in another component of functional diversity (functional dispersion) resulted in decreased productivity. 4.

Our study provides the first evidence for the opposite effects of community-weighted means and functional dispersion of plant functional traits on grassland productivity and highlights the importance of both traits of dominant species and trait distribution among species in modulating the effects of global changes on ecosystem functions.","[Xu, Zhuwen; Li, Mai-He; Li, Hui; Sun, Hao; Han, Xingguo; Jiang, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhuwen; Li, Shao-Peng; Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Li, Mai-He; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Ren, Haiyan] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Jiang, Y (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.;Jiang, L (autor correspondente), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jiangyong@iae.ac.cn; lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; Li, Hui/AEA-0681-2022; Ren, Haiyan/I-1863-2019; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; Jiang, Yong/A-2263-2012; Xu, Zhuwen/GLS-8029-2022; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016; Xu, ZhuWen/O-3635-2015; Li, Shaopeng/C-3983-2016","Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; Ren, Haiyan/0000-0002-2008-9626; Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Jiang, Yong/0000-0001-7518-5810; Xu, Zhuwen/0000-0002-8898-6577; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; Xu, ZhuWen/0000-0002-8898-6577; Li, Shaopeng/0000-0002-1730-3433","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31361123001, 31370009, 41371251]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500707]; National Science Foundation of USA [DEB-1342754]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Science Foundation of USA(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31361123001, 31370009 and 41371251; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500707; National Science Foundation of USA, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1342754",NA,89,49,66,62,299,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In particular, approaches based on functional traits rather than species diversity are increasingly used to reflect interactions between organisms and their environment. These approaches bring a functional perspective to the study of community structure responses to disturbances and resources, and of their effects on ecosystem functioning and services. From an academic perspective, we propose a conceptual framework based on species functional traits to better infer how grassland management practices (fertilization, defoliation regime) along with abiotic factors influence plant, animal and microbial community composition and a range of services in grassland ecosystems. The core of the framework relies on combinations of plant functional traits and associated microbial features that specifically respond to environmental and management factors and influence ecosystem services. To overcome stakeholders' difficulty in applying the concept of functional traits, we propose an operational approach implying the mapping of plant communities distributed into five plant functional types (PFTs). The approach was used for fields in grassland-based livestock farms from two French grassland networks. We evaluated its ability to predict a range of services including forage provision and non-market services according to environmental and management drivers. PFT-based plant community composition predicted forage services reasonably well but responded weakly to environmental gradients. To cope with the observed limitations of current predictive approaches, we suggest including soil microbial functional types and adaptive management rather than using a prescriptive scheme.","[Duru, M.; Jouany, C.; Cruz, P.] INRA, UMR1248, AGIR, F-31320 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Duru, M.; Jouany, C.; Cruz, P.] Univ Toulouse, INPT, UMR AGIR, F-31029 Toulouse, France; [Le Roux, X.] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, INRA, Microbial Ecol Ctr,UMR 5557,USC 1364, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Navas, M.

However, there is a lack of a conceptual framework that highlights the application of functional diversity as an ecological indicator. Therefore, we present a new initiative for motivating the development of ecological indicators based on functional diversity. We are interested in showing the challenges and solutions associated with these indicators. We integrated species assemblage theories and literature reviews. We considered plant traits related to ecosystem processes and functions (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, wood density, phenology, and seed mass) to show the application of a selection of functional diversity metrics that can be used as ecological indicators (i.e., community weighted-mean, functional divergence, functional richness and functional evenness). We caution that functional diversity as an ecological indicator can be misinterpreted if species composition is unknown. Functional diversity values can be over-represented by weed species (species established in disturbed sites) and do not maintain original processes and functions in ecosystems. Therefore, we searched for evidence to demonstrate that weed species are ecological indicators of functional diversity changes. We found support for two hypotheses that explain the effect of weed species on ecosystem function: functional homogenization, and functional transformation. Likewise, we showed the application of some tools that can help study anthropogenic effects on functional indicators. This perspective shows that the paradigm of addressing the effects of disturbances on ecosystem processes by using functional diversity as an ecological indicator can improve environmental evaluation, particularly in areas affected by human activities.","[Bonilla-Valencia, Leticia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciencias Biol, Ave Univ S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Bonilla-Valencia, Leticia; Castillo-Aguero, Silvia; Martinez-Orea, Yuriana] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Zavala-Hurtado, Jose Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Biol, Mexico City 09340, DF, Mexico; [Garcia, Francisco J.

We studied community- and species-level leaf functional trait changes in a full factorial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization experiment in a semi-arid grassland. Nitrogen was the only nutrient addition to significantly affect leaf functional traits, and N addition increased community-weighted specific leaf area (SLA) by 19%, leaf chlorophyll content by 34%, height by 26%, and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) decreased by 11% while leaf thickness and toughness did not change significantly. At the species level, most species contributed to the community-weighted trait and increased in SLA, chlorophyll, height, and LDMC with N addition. These intraspecific changes in functional traits account for 51-71% of the community-level changes in SLA, chlorophyll, plant height, and LDMC. The remaining change is due to species abundance changes; the two most abundant species (Bouteloua gracilis and Carex filifolia) decreased in abundance with N addition while subdominant species increased in abundance. We also found annual variation in SLA, chlorophyll, plant height, and LDMC to be as important in influencing traits as N addition, likely due to differences in precipitation. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) did not change significantly with N addition. However, N addition caused a 34% increase in leaf area index (LAI) and a 67% increase in canopy chlorophyll density. We demonstrate that nitrogen-induced changes in both functional traits and species abundances magnify ANPP changes in LAI and canopy chlorophyll density. Therefore, ANPP underestimates N addition-induced ecosystem-level changes in the canopy vegetation.","[Tatarko, Anna R.; Knops, Johannes M.

Less is known about the effects of plant species richness on functions related to higher trophic levels, such as the consumption of biomass by animals, that is, herbivory. Previous studies have shown positive, neutral, or negative effects of plant species richness on herbivory. In the framework of a grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment), we investigated herbivory (the proportion of leaf area damaged and the amount of leaf biomass consumed by arthropod herbivores) along two experimental gradients of plant species richness ranging from 1 to 60 species (Main Experiment) and from 1 to 8 species (Trait-Based Experiment) biannually for five and three years, respectively. Additionally, plant functional diversity, based on traits related to plant growth, was manipulated as the number of functional groups in a community (Main Experiment) or a gradient of functional trait dissimilarity (Trait-Based Experiment). Herbivory at the level of plant communities ranged from 0% to 31% (0 and 33.8 g/m(2)) in the Main Experiment and 0% to 8% (0 and 13.7 g/m(2)) in the Trait-Based Experiment, and it was on average higher in summer than in spring. For both experimental gradients and all years investigated, we found a consistent increase in damaged leaf area and consumed biomass with increasing plant species richness. As mechanistic explanations for effects of plant species richness, we propose changes in plant quality and herbivore communities. The presence of specific plant functional groups significantly affected herbivory, likely related to traits affecting plant defense and nutritional value, but we found little evidence for effects of plant functional diversity. The general positive relationship between plant species richness and herbivory might contribute to effects of plant species richness on other ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient mineralization and can cascade up the food web also affecting higher trophic levels.","[Meyer, Sebastian T.; Scheithe, Lukas; Hertzog, Lionel; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger St 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wagg, Cameron] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Hertzog, Lionel] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, Ledeganckstr 35, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Technical University of Munich; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Ghent University,"Meyer, ST (autor correspondente), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sebastian.t.meyer@tum.de,"Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/AAH-3856-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Wagg, Cameron/O-4318-2019","Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/0000-0003-0833-1472; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Wagg, Cameron/0000-0002-9738-6901; Hertzog, Lionel/0000-0003-0869-9672",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1451]; Technical University of Munich,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Technical University of Munich,"We thank Enrica de Luca and Alexandra Weigelt for providing plant biomass data and Marlen Gubsch and Annett Lipowsky for providing plant trait data.

Given that approximately one-quarter of grasslands worldwide have been converted to agriculture, understanding the consequences of agricultural conversion for ecosystem functioning can provide insight into potential changes in the world's most intensively managed biomes. The Great Plains of the United States represents a major grassland region that has experienced substantial conversion of prairie grassland ecosystems to agriculture, leading to widespread changes in plant species composition and functional trait diversity. While the converted system dramatically improves food, fuel and fibre production, changes in plant trait diversity may alter the capacity of these ecosystems to provide sustaining and regulating services to society. 2. Using three key plant functional traits, we illustrate how the trait composition and trait diversity of the Great Plains plant communities has been dramatically altered when visualized in multidimensional trait space, showing strong displacement and a 10-fold reduction in trait space volumes, as systems have shifted from grassland to agricultural regimes. However, individual case studies demonstrate large variation in the direction and magnitude of trait diversity change during conversion, with some case studies exhibiting much larger reductions in trait diversity from the average on conversion, largely a consequence of the changes in species richness accompanying agricultural conversion. 3. Synthesis and applications. The conversion of grassland to agriculture does not necessarily lead to a loss of functional trait diversity, as crop choice and diversity can ameliorate the functional trait differences between native-dominated and agricultural communities. In this study, regardless of the sign and magnitude of change in trait space, a shift in trait range was observed, reflecting the dramatically different selection that agricultural plant functional traits experience compared with their native counterparts. Historical agricultural policy and modern land-use patterns have led to a landscape with decreasing plant diversity and functional capacity. However, initiatives to increase agricultural diversity on-farm and at the landscape level through the implementation of cover crops of the perennialization of cropping systems may allow ecosystems to recover and maintain greater functional capacity.","[Lin, Brenda B.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10025 USA; [Lin, Brenda B.; Flynn, Dan F.

Despite several field studies, still uncertainties remain about the interplay of species traits and ecosystem processes that lead to the functional diversity observed in grasslands. Here, we used an individual-based process-oriented model to simulate a biodiversity field experiment located in Central Europe. With the focus on plant functional types (PFT), the simulation model well reproduced vegetation attributes of grassland communities at different diversity levels (of up to four PFTs of grasses, small herbs, tall herbs and legumes). To understand how plant traits and competition between plants affects the functional composition of grasslands, we tested in a simulation study the impact of different ecosystem processes and detected sensitive plant traits. According to our model results, competition for space affects community productivity stronger than competition for light. While some traits increase and strengthen the growth of plants, other functional traits make plants stronger through advantages in demographic processes. Our model-based findings can be substantiated by several independent field studies in terms of relative yield, plant density, plant biomass and life span of plant functional types.

These include small scale disturbances like a falling tree, but also large scale disturbances like eutrophication and climate change. Resilience is a useful indicator to assess whether an ecosystem has the capacity to maintain functioning with environmental variability. In this study we tested whether plant functional traits can be distinguished to develop a response-and-effect framework for general predictions concerning resilience. We defined response traits to assess the system's resistance to disturbance, and effect traits to assess its recovery after disturbance. We used a dataset with 932 vegetation plots containing 104 species from a selected wetland area in The Netherlands. The environmental variability was related to response traits and the response traits to effect traits with RLQ analysis, fourth-corner analysis and Spearman's rank correlation. As a result, combinations of traits that specify effects of environmental change on ecosystem resilience were found. A strong resistance to environmental variability was shown, and consequently, a positive effect on resilience. Due to correlations between response and effect traits, combinations of traits were identified having a variable effect on the resilience of the system. In this way this study argues to further develop a response-and-effect framework to understand and assess ecosystem resilience. The selection of traits is system-specific, and therefore, one should only select those response and effect traits that differentiate between response to environmental variability and effects on ecosystem functioning.

Plant traits can provide unique insights into plant performance at the community scale. Functional composition, defined by both functional diversity and community-weighted trait means (CWMs), can affect the stability of above-ground net primary production (ANPP) in response to climate extremes. Further complexity arises, however, when functional composition itself responds to environmental change. The duration of climate extremes, such as drought, is expected to increase with rising global temperatures; thus, understanding the impacts of long-term drought on functional composition and the corresponding effect that has on ecosystem function could improve predictions of ecosystem sensitivity to climate change. 2. We experimentally reduced growing season precipitation by 66% across six temperate grasslands for 4 years and measured changes in three indices of functional diversity (functional dispersion, richness and evenness), community-weighted trait means and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and (at most sites) leaf turgor loss point (pi(TLP)) were measured for species cumulatively representing similar to 90% plant cover at each site. 3. Long-term drought led to increased community functional dispersion in three sites, with negligible effects on the remaining sites. Species re-ordering following the mortality/senescence of dominant species was the main driver of increased functional dispersion. The response of functional diversity was not consistently matched by changes in phylogenetic diversity. Community-level drought strategies (assessed as CWMs) largely shifted from drought tolerance to drought avoidance and/or escape strategies, as evidenced by higher community-weighted pi(TLP), SLA and LNC. Lastly, ecosystem drought sensitivity (i.e. relative reduction in ANPP in drought plots) was positively correlated with community-weighted SLA and negatively correlated with functional diversity. 4. Synthesis. Increased functional diversity following long-term drought may stabilize ecosystem functioning in response to future drought. However, shifts in community-scale drought strategies may increase ecosystem drought sensitivity, depending on the nature and timing of drought. Thus, our results highlight the importance of considering both functional diversity and abundance-weighted traits means of plant communities as their collective effect may either stabilize or enhance ecosystem sensitivity to drought.","[Griffin-Nolan, Robert J.; Hoffman, Ava M.; Smith, Melinda D.; Knapp, Alan K.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Griffin-Nolan, Robert J.; Hoffman, Ava M.; Smith, Melinda D.; Knapp, Alan K.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Blumenthal, Dana M.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80522 USA; [Collins, Scott L.; Farkas, Timothy E.; Whitney, Kenneth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Mueller, Kevin E.] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Ocheltree, Troy W.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of New Mexico; University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; Colorado State University,"Griffin-Nolan, RJ (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Griffin-Nolan, RJ (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rgriffi2@colostate.edu,"Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; Mueller, Kevin E/I-3633-2019; Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008; Whitney, Kenneth D/B-2971-2011","Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Mueller, Kevin E/0000-0002-0739-7472; Whitney, Kenneth D/0000-0002-2523-5469; Griffin-Nolan, Robert/0000-0002-9411-3588; Smith, Melinda/0000-0003-4920-6985","NSF Macrosystems Biology Program [DEB-1137378, 1137363, 1137342]",NSF Macrosystems Biology Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"NSF Macrosystems Biology Program, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1137378, 1137363 and 1137342",NA,101,63,66,48,244,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Although both mechanisms have been studied in plant communities and experiments at small spatial extents, it remains unclear whether evidence from small-extent case studies translates into a generalizable macroecological pattern. Here, we evaluate dominance and niche partitioning effects simultaneously in grassland systems world-wide.Location: Two thousand nine hundred and forty-one grassland plots globally.Time period: 2000-2014.Major taxa studied: Vascular plants.Methods: We obtained plot-based data on functional community structure from the global vegetation plot database sPlot , which combines species composition with plant trait data from the TRY  database. We used data on the community-weighted mean (CWM) and FD for 18 ecologically relevant plant traits. As an indicator of primary productivity, we extracted the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS. Using generalized additive models and deviation partitioning, we estimated the contributions of trait CWM and FD to the variation in annual maximum NDVI, while controlling for climatic variables and spatial structure.Results: Grassland communities dominated by relatively tall species with acquisitive traits had higher NDVI values, suggesting the prevalence of dominance effects for BEF relationships. We found no support for niche partitioning for the functional traits analysed, because NDVI remained unaffected by FD. Most of the predictive power of traits was shared by climatic predictors and spatial coordinates. This highlights the importance of community assembly processes for BEF relationships in natural communities.Main conclusions: Our analysis provides empirical evidence that plant functional community structure and global patterns in primary productivity are linked through the resource economics and size traits of the dominant species. This is an important test of the hypotheses underlying BEF relationships at the global scale.","[Engel, Thore] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Engel, Thore] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Comp Sci, Halle An Der Saale, Germany; [Engel, Thore] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecosyst Serv, Leipzig, Germany; [Engel, Thore; Bruelheide, Helge; Hoss, Daniela; Sabatini, Francesco M.; Dengler, Juergen; Jandt, Ute; Kattge, Jens; Roemermann, Christine] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Engel, Thore; Hoss, Daniela; Velez-Martin, Eduardo; Pillar, Valerio] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Bruelheide, Helge; Sabatini, Francesco M.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle An Der Saale, Germany; [Sabatini, Francesco M.] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BiGeA, BIOME Lab, Bologna, Italy; [Sabatini, Francesco M.] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Engel, Thore; Altman, Jan; Cerny, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Arfin-Khan, Mohammed A.

This has proven difficult because the putative causes (e.g., environment, species identity, biodiversity, and functional traits) are numerous and correlated. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of a formal framework for unambiguously relating theoretical language to precise, quantitative expressions of that language. Using a formal framework for the graphical expression of complex causal hypotheses, we developed a causal diagram of the concepts required to comprehensively test whether hypothesized sets of functional traits mediate the relationship between community structure and ecosystem function. We then used causal analysis, simulations, and field data to develop and test analytical strategies for understanding how community structure influences ecosystem functions via functional traits. Formal causal analysis showed that biodiversity-ecosystem function correlations are noncausal associations. Using simulations, we showed how biodiversity correlations and species identity effects can arise from misspecification or incomplete mediation by functional trait composites. We also found that different types of model misspecification result in different patterns of residuals, which may be used to diagnose gaps in functional trait hypotheses. Treating the model misspecifications eliminated associations between species identity or biodiversity and ecosystem function. Finally, we provide an example of the analysis of field data to demonstrate how to use these insights to conduct a research program that has the goal of understanding the mechanistic trait relationships that link community structure to ecosystem function.","[Schoolmaster, Donald R., Jr.; Cronin, James Patrick] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; [Schoolmaster, Donald R., Jr.] WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 612 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav, 612 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zirbel, Chad R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Schoolmaster, DR (autor correspondente), US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA.;Schoolmaster, DR (autor correspondente), WK Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",schoolmasterd@usgs.gov,"Zirbel, Chad R/J-7745-2019","Zirbel, Chad R/0000-0002-9289-1722; Cronin, James Patrick/0000-0001-6791-5828",U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ecosystems Program; USGS-NSF Graduate Research Internship Partnership [DGE1424871],U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ecosystems Program; USGS-NSF Graduate Research Internship Partnership,"All authors contributed to the ideas for and to the writing and revising of drafts of the manuscript.

Progressive, realistic, biodiversity losses are generally strongly nested, but this nestedness is a potentially confounding effect. Here, we address whether nonrandom trait loss or degree of nestedness drives the relationship between diversity and productivity in a realistic biodiversity-loss experiment. We isolated the effect of nestedness through post hoc analyses of data from an experimental biodiversity manipulation in a California serpentine grassland. We found that the order in which plant traits are lost as diversity declines influences the diversity productivity relationship more than the degree of nestedness does. Understanding the relationship between the expected order of species loss and functional traits is becoming increasingly important in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss worldwide. Our findings illustrate the importance of species composition and the order of species loss, rather than nestedness per se, for understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of realistic species losses on ecosystem functioning.","[Wolf, Amelia A.; Zavaleta, Erika S.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Wolf, AA (autor correspondente), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",amywolf@gmail.edu,,"Wolf, Amelia/0000-0001-7660-3455",NSF [DEB0918785],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by NSF grant DEB0918785.

Plant traits can be used to predict ecosystem responses to environmental change using a response-effect trait framework. To do this, appropriate traits must be identified that explain a species' influence on ecosystem function (effect traits) and the response of those species to environmental change (response traits). Response traits are often identified and measured along gradients in plant resources, such as water availability; however, precipitation explains very little variation in most plant traits globally. Given the strong relationship between plant traits and ecosystem functions, such as net primary productivity (NPP), and between NPP and precipitation, the lack of correlation between precipitation and plant traits is surprising. 2. We address this issue through a systematic review of >500 published studies that describe plant trait responses to altered water availability. The overarching goal of this review was to identify potential causes for the weak relationship between commonly measured plant traits and water availability so that we may identify more appropriate response traits. 3. We attribute weak trait-precipitation relationships to an improper selection of traits (e.g., nonhydraulic traits) and a lack of trait-based approaches that adjust for trait variation within communities (only 4% of studies measure community-weighted traits). We then highlight the mechanistic value of hydraulic traits as more appropriate response traits with regard to precipitation, which should be included in future community-scale trait surveys. 4. based ecology has the potential to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to predicted changes in precipitation; however, this predictive power depends heavily on the identification of reliable response and effect traits. To this end, trait surveys could be improved by a selection of traits that reflect physiological functions directly related to water availability with traits weighted by species relative abundance.","[Griffin-Nolan, Robert J.; Carroll, Charles J.

We documented the impacts of clearcutting on the functional structure of tree and herbaceous communities in hemiboreal, cool-temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical forests in the Japanese archipelago and identified forest vegetation that is vulnerable to deterioration of important ecosystem functions. We combined species data for leaf, stem, flower and fruit traits related to productivity, nutrient cycling and habitat quality for wildlife with phytosociological vegetation data from unmanaged and previously clearcut forests, then calculated functional structure indices [community mean (CM) of trait values, functional richness (FRic) and functional divergence (RaoQ)] of plant communities. For tree species, functional structure indices of specific leaf area (SLA), leaf carbon and nitrogen concentrations, maximum height, wood density and flower size differed between unmanaged and clearcut forests, while for herb species, only maximum height differed between the two forest types. Functional structure indices showed divergent patterns across forest vegetation zones. In hemiboreal, cool-temperate and warm-temperate forests, the CMs of SLA and leaf nitrogen concentration were greater and that of leaf carbon concentration was smaller in clearcut than in unmanaged forests. Although clearcut forests had greater species richness than unmanaged forests, FRic and/or RaoQ of maximum height were smaller in clearcut forests. In hemiboreal and cool-temperate forests, FRic and RaoQ of SLA were also smaller in clearcut forests. In contrast, subtropical forests showed no differences in species richness and functional structures between unmanaged and clearcut forests.Synthesis and applications. Functional redundancy of plant communities differs among traits and among forest vegetation zones. After intensive logging, hemiboreal, cool-temperate and warm-temperate forests were more vulnerable to the loss of ecosystem functions related to leaf and stem traits of tree species than were subtropical forests, which appeared relatively resilient. Locally adaptive management to maintain multiple ecosystem functions should be developed based on the degree of functional complementarity among plant species in forest communities.

The internal cycling of nitrogen (N) is a critical process in terrestrial ecosystems. Nitrification occurs when soil microbes convert ammonium to nitrate. Nitrification is known to be regulated by abiotic soil properties, but less is known about how plant communities influence this important ecosystem function. 2. Two contrasting hypotheses propose mechanisms for how communities influence ecosystem processes. The 'mass ratio hypothesis' proposes that dominant species control ecosystem processes, e.g. communities dominated by plants with high leaf N content may increase rates of N cycling. The 'diversity hypothesis' proposes that community diversity controls ecosystem processes, e.g. diverse communities may increase rates of N cycling by providing a more consistent supply of organic N as variable litter qualities break down at different rates. Each hypothesis was simultaneously evaluated using structural equation modelling in the context of a ponderosa pine forest. 3. The first principle component extracted from a species-trait matrix captured interspecific covariation in leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf N content. This 'leaf economics spectrum' was scaled to the community-level by calculating community-weighted mean leaf trait axis scores. Quadratic entropy was used as the index of understorey functional diversity to capture variation in functional traits within the community. 4. Structural equation modelling results suggest that soil factors, such as pH, temperature, C:N mass ratio and total N were the dominant factors exerting direct control over nitrification potential. Understorey leaf traits were positively associated with nitrification potential, suggesting that high-quality litter inputs increase rates of nitrification. The negative indirect effects of pine abundance on nitrification mediated through soil properties were much stronger than the direct effect of understorey leaf traits. 5. Synthesis. The leaf economics spectrum is an important gradient of functional trait variation that has consequences for internal N cycling. Nitrification potential was more strongly linked to dominant leaf traits than to functional diversity, thereby lending more support to the mass ratio hypothesis. However, functional diversity still explained some of the observed variation in biomass production. Leaf traits can be used to understand how internal N cycling rates will be affected by changes in vegetation structure.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University,"Laughlin, DC (autor correspondente), Univ Waikato, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",daniel.laughlin@nau.edu,"Laughlin, Daniel/G-8855-2012",,Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU); U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) [08-JV-11221633-23],Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI) at Northern Arizona University (NAU); U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS)(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"I thank M.

Metal mining in drylands generates waste tailings with high toxicity, physical instability, as well as water and thermal stresses that hamper their biological colonization. This limits the restoration of ecosystem functions that are essential to re-integrate these artificial micro-deserts within the landscape matrix. 2. We assessed the functional role of local nurse plant species and their traits to restore ecosystem functions related to soil fertility, soil microbial productivity and the reduction of abiotic stress. We sampled 30 metalliferous tailings in a mining district from semi-arid Spain to detect nurse plant species and quantify their ability to promote essential functions from their establishment on the barren substrate up to the adult stage. 3. We found 11 plant species acting as nurses out of 102 species able to colonize barren soils. Ten nurses further triggered a cascade of effects increasing soil fertility and microbial productivity and/or lowering soil abiotic stress. 4. Plant species with larger life-forms and longer periods of establishment since tailing abandonment contributed the most to the promotion of ecosystem functions. C4 plant species developing root systems with lower intensivity and depth: laterality ratios, as well as leaves with lower carbon: nitrogen ratios (C:N) induced a faster recovery of ecosystem functions. 5. Synthesis and applications. We propose a protocol for selecting key species to be used in restoration programmes based on their ability to restore ecosystem functions under extremely stressful conditions. We encourage combination of multiple target species with complementary traits in order to reinforce the rehabilitation of ecosystem functions.","[Antonio Navarro-Cano, Jose; Verdu, Miguel; Goberna, Marta] CSIC UVEG GV, Ctr Invest Desertificac, Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE),"Navarro-Cano, JA (autor correspondente), CSIC UVEG GV, Ctr Invest Desertificac, Valencia, Spain.",jose.a.navarro@uv.es,"Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/L-8281-2013; Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Goberna, Marta/A-9183-2012","Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8091-1063; Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; Goberna, Marta/0000-0001-5303-3429",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2014-58333-P]; Fundacion BBVA,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fundacion BBVA(BBVA Foundation),"Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: CGL2014-58333-P; Fundacion BBVA",NA,50,39,41,10,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Using a novel response-effect trait framework, we seek to identify and explain the mechanisms governing the cascading effects of environment on plant traits and ecosystem multi-functioning in the large Poyang Lake wetland, China. We sampled the above-ground biomass of the plant communities in 129,100 m(2) plots and estimated the community weighted mean (functional identity, CWM) and distribution (functional diversity, FD) of seven plant morphological and phenological traits. The response-effect trait model (as showed by generalized multilevel path models) explained 97% and 51% of the variation in community productivity and soil carbon, respectively, and indicated that CWM morphometric (-morph) and CWM phenotypic (-pheno) traits promoted community productivity. Soil nutrient, followed by soil moisture exerted dominant and direct control on soil carbon. Elevation as well as soil moisture and nutrients had indirect effects on community productivity and soil carbon either via CWM or FD traits. Our study indicates that mass ratio processes (as reflected by CWM) modified the variations in community productivity and that niche complementary processes (as reflected by FD) explained some of the variations in soil carbon, though the relationships were weak. We conclude that a trait-based approach is useful in predicting the cascading effects of environmental factors on productivity, while the tested traits (that did not include root traits) mediated only a few environmental effects on soil carbon.","[Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang; Ge, Dabing; Zou, Dongsheng; Wu, Aiping; Liu, Qiaolin] Hunan Agr Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dongting La, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Beijing East Rd 1038, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Nanchang Inst Technol, Res Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha Res Stn Agr & Environm Monitoring, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Changsha, Hunan 410125, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res SDC, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Ankara, Turkey","Hunan Agricultural University; Nanchang Institute Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Middle East Technical University","Fu, H; Yuan, GX (autor correspondente), Hunan Agr Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dongting La, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.;Fu, H; Yuan, GX (autor correspondente), Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Beijing East Rd 1038, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",huifu367@163.com; yuangx987@163.com,"Wu, Aiping/AAU-8710-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770510, 31760148, 31560145]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [20171BAB214006]; WATEC-Centre for Water Technology, AU; TuBITAK Outstanding Scientist Program 2232","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); WATEC-Centre for Water Technology, AU; TuBITAK Outstanding Scientist Program 2232(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 31770510, 31760148, 31560145) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China (Grant no. 20171BAB214006).

Here, we present a method which uses two different groups of biotic predictor variables being (1) abundance-weighted mean (=aggregated) trait values and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FD(Q)) to test the competing hypotheses on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships after accounting for co-varying abiotic factors. We applied this method to data recorded on biodiversity-biomass relationships and environmental variables in 35 semi-natural temperate grasslands and used a literature-based matrix of fourteen plant functional traits to assess the explanatory power of models including different sets of predictor variables. Aboveground community biomass did not correlate with species richness. Abiotic factors, in particular soil nitrogen concentration, explained about 50% of variability in aboveground biomass. The best model incorporating functional trait diversity explained only about 30%, while the best model based on aggregated trait values explained about 54% of variability in aboveground biomass. The inclusion of all predictor variable groups in a combined model increased the predictive power to about 75%. This model comprised soil nitrogen concentration as abiotic factor, aggregated traits being indicative for species competitive dominance (rooting depth, leaf distribution, specific leaf area, perennial life cycle) and functional trait diversity in vegetative plant height, leaf area and life cycle. Our study strongly suggests that abiotic factors, trait values of the dominant species and functional trait diversity in combination may best explain differences in aboveground community biomass in natural ecosystems and that their isolated consideration may be misleading.","[Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, DE-07743 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, DE-07701 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Max Planck Society,"Schumacher, J (autor correspondente), Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, Ernst Abbe Pl 2, DE-07743 Jena, Germany.",croscher@bgc-jena.mpg.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) [FOR 456],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank I.

While these studies have generally confirmed the importance of biodiversity to the functioning of ecosystems, their broader significance has been difficult to interpret. The main reasons for this difficulty concern the small scales of the experiment, a bias towards plants and grasslands, and most importantly a general lack of clarity in terms of what attributes of functional diversity (FD) were actually manipulated. We review how functional traits, functional groups, and the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity have been used in current BEF research. Several points emerged from our review. First, it is critical to distinguish between response and effect functional traits when quantifying or manipulating FD. Second, although it is widely done, using trophic position as a functional group designator does not fit the effect-response trait division needed in BEF research. Third, determining a general relationship between taxonomic and FD is neither necessary nor desirable in BEF research. Fourth, fundamental principles in community and biogeographical ecology that have been largely ignored in BEF research could serve to dramatically improve the scope and predictive capabilities of BEF research. We suggest that distinguishing between functional response traits and functional effect traits both in combinatorial manipulations of biodiversity and in descriptive studies of BEF could markedly improve the power of such studies. We construct a possible framework for predictive, broad-scale BEF research that requires integrating functional, community, biogeographical, and ecosystem ecology with taxonomy.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Naeem, S (autor correspondente), Univ Washington, Dept Zool, 24 Kincaid Hall, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",naeems@u.washington.edu,,,,,,NA,111,460,478,14,248,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Niche complementarity and selection effect have been widely investigated to address biodiversity-productivity relationships. However, the overlooking of the specific role played by key species has limited so far our capacity to comprehensively assess the relative importance of other potential drivers of biodiversity effects. Here, we conducted a grassland diversity-productivity experiment to test how four potential facets of biodiversity effects, namely species richness, functional diversity, species identity and the relaxation of intraspecific competition, account for variations in above and root biomass production. We grew six plant species in monoculture, as well as in every combination of two, three and six species. Plant density was kept constant across the richness gradient but we additionally grew each species in half-density monoculture to estimate the strength of intraspecific competition for each studied species. We characterized eight functional traits, including root traits, related to nutrient and light acquisition and computed both the functional dissimilarity and the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait. We further partitioned above-ground biodiversity effect into complementarity and selection effects. We observed strong positive biodiversity effects on both above-ground and root biomass as well as strong positive complementarity effect. These arose largely from the presence of a particular species (Plantago lanceolata) and from CWM trait values more than from a higher functional dissimilarity in plant mixtures. P. lanceolata displayed the highest intraspecific competition, which was strongly relaxed in species mixtures. By contrast, the presence of Sanguisorba minor negatively affected the productivity of plant mixtures, this species suffering more from interspecific than intraspecific competition. This study provides strong evidences that the search for key species is critical to understand the role of species diversity on ecosystem functioning and demonstrates the major role that the balance between intraspecific and interspecific competition plays in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Developing more integrative approaches in community and ecosystem ecology can offer opportunities to better understand the role that species diversity plays on ecosystem functioning.

Recent studies have focused mostly on leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits to predict species responses to grazing and the consequent change in ecosystem functioning. However, studies of leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits seldom identify the mechanisms linking grazing impact on leaf traits to ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multi-organization-level approach, we examined the effects of grazing on leaf traits (i.e., leaf area, leaf dry mass and specific leaf area) and ecosystem functioning across six communities of three vegetation types along a soil moisture gradient in the Xilin River Basin of Inner Mongolia grassland, China. Our results showed that the effects of grazing on leaf traits differed substantially when scaling up from leaf-level to species, functional group (i.e., life forms and water ecotype types), and community levels; and they also varied with vegetation type or site conditions. The effects of grazing on leaf traits diminished progressively along the hierarchy of organizational levels in the meadow, whereas the impacts were predominantly negative and the magnitude of the effects increased considerably at higher organizational levels in the typical steppe. Soil water and nutrient availability, functional trade-offs between leaf size and number of leaves per individual, and differentiation in avoidance and tolerance strategies among coexisting species are likely to be responsible for the observed responses of leaf traits to grazing at different levels of organization and among vegetation types. Our findings also demonstrate that, at both the functional group and community levels, standing aboveground biomass increased with leaf area and specific leaf area. Compared with the large changes in leaf traits and standing aboveground biomass, the soil properties were relatively unaffected by grazing. Our study indicates that a multi-organization-level approach provides more robust and comprehensive predictions of the effects of grazing on leaf traits and ecosystem functioning.","[Zheng, S.

However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (N-area), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem management from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.","[Sakschewski, Boris; von Bloh, Werner; Boit, Alice; Rammig, Anja; Thonicke, Kirsten] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Sakschewski, Boris; von Bloh, Werner; Boit, Alice; Rammig, Anja; Thonicke, Kirsten] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, CSIC, Global Ecol Unit CREAF, Catalonia 08193, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Catalonia 08193, Spain",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Max Planck Society; Wageningen University & Research; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF),"Sakschewski, B (autor correspondente), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Telegraphenberg A31, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",boris.sakschewski@pik-potsdam.de,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016","Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469; Rammig, Anja/0000-0001-5425-8718; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875","European Union [283093]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS 'Climat, Environnement et Societe' France","European Union(European Commission); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS 'Climat, Environnement et Societe' France","We thank Nuno Carvalhais and Matthias Forkel from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (Jena, Germany), Jorg Asmus (University of Bergen, Norway), and Jasmin Joshi (University of Potsdam, Germany) for lively discussions about an earlier version of this manuscript.

Using a generalized multilevel path model, we examined the cascading effects of hydrological gradients on plant diversity and ecosystem functions in two distinct habitat types (short grassland with a natural community dominated by Carex spp. and tall grassland with a managed artificial community dominated by Triarrhena lutarioriparia and Phragmites australis). We found significant differences in the response of plant diversity and AGB to hydrological gradients. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, multiple-trait functional diversity measures (i.e., functional richness, functional dispersion & Rao's quadratic entropy) and community-weighted mean (CWM) of shoot height were all significantly higher and functional divergence and CWM of tuber significantly lower in tall grassland. AGB was significantly higher in short grassland, largely driven by variations of functional diversity rather than of taxonomic diversity. Moreover, we found a significant cascading effect of elevation and soil moisture on AGB, directly or indirectly induced by changes in functional diversity in the short grassland, while only direct effects of elevation on AGB were observed in the tall grassland. Therefore, our study provides strong evidence that human-induced changes in habitat types uncoupled the cascading effects of hydrological gradients on ecosystem functions mediated by either the taxonomic or the functional diversity.","[Fu, Hui; Wang, Xiaoyan; Ge, Dabing; Tan, Xiaoyao; Yuan, Guixiang] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ecol Dept, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Lake Dongti, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Nanchang Inst Technol, Res Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res SDC, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Limnol Lab, Dept Biol Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Erdemli Mersin, Turkey","Hunan Agricultural University; Nanchang Institute Technology; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University","Fu, H; Ge, DB (autor correspondente), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Ecol Dept, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Lake Dongti, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China.",huifu367@163.com; 1157630608@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760148, 31770510]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China [2020JJ5231, 2020JJ5247]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31760148, 31770510; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2020JJ5231, 2020JJ5247",NA,60,1,1,7,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,JAN,2022,15,1,,,,NA,,,e2359,10.1002/eco.2359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2359,NA,OCT 2021,10,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,YN5HJ,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000702359800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few empirical studies have investigated the strength and form of the relationship between species and functional diversity (i.e., the presence of functional redundancy in ecological communities) in this context. In particular, we know little about how local extinctions in real communities might impact functional diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between species and functional diversity in plant communities along a grazing gradient across Mongolian rangeland ecosystems. We applied a recently described measure of functional diversity that incorporates species' dissimilarities defined from plant functional traits and tested several hypothesized forms of the relationship between species and functional diversity using linear and nonlinear modeling techniques. We found a significant sigmoid logistic relationship between species richness and functional diversity in relatively benign environmental conditions. This indicates high functional redundancy at low levels of species richness followed by a rapid increase at intermediate levels, until functional diversity reaches an asymptote at high levels (i.e., two-phase functional redundancy). In contrast, we generally observed a positive linear relationship between these parameters in relatively harsh environmental conditions, indicating low functional redundancy. Observed functional redundancy probably resulted from two factors, intrinsic redundancy in species' functional traits and extrinsic redundancy caused by nonrandom compositional change that is nonrandom with respect to functional traits. Lack of either intrinsic or extrinsic redundancy may result in low functional redundancy. Two-phase functional redundancy suggests that functional traits are abruptly lost from a community below a certain level of species richness, and a community then shifts into a contrasting state that has a few limited functional groups characterized by disturbance-resistant traits, as a consequence of disturbances such as livestock grazing. This study represents a major step forward in predicting the consequences of livestock grazing on the functioning of Mongolian rangeland ecosystems.","[Sasaki, Takehiro; Okubo, Satoru; Okayasu, Tomoo; Ohkuro, Toshiya; Takeuchi, Kazuhiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Ecosyst Studies, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Jamsran, Undarmaa] Mongolian State Univ Agr, Ctr Ecosyst Study, Ulaanbaatar 210153, Mongolia",University of Tokyo; Mongolian University of Life Sciences,"Sasaki, T (autor correspondente), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, 6-3 Aoba, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",sasa67123@gmail.com,"Okuro, Toshiya/AAP-8431-2020; Sasaki, Takehiro/C-8896-2012; Jamsran, Undarmaa/AAS-9181-2021; Okubo, Satoru/E-6236-2010","Okuro, Toshiya/0000-0003-2618-9828; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152; Okubo, Satoru/0000-0002-3736-513X",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship for Young Scientists [1811503]; Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment [G071],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Research Fellowship for Young Scientists(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment","This study would not have been possible without the willing cooperation of the local herders at the study sites.

While it is acknowledged that biodiversity contributes to EMF, the relative importance of functional traits diversity (niche complementarity) and dominance (selection effects) for EMF needs further investigation. To address this gap, we analysed how tree species diversity influences EMF, using data on species functional traits (specific wood density, specific leaf area and maximum plant height) and four ecosystem functions (carbon storage, habitat quality, forage provision and rockfall protection) in an Afromontane forest in South Africa. We tested the hypotheses that (i) trait diversity rather than dominance would link species richness to EMF; and (ii) diversity rather than species richness effects would increase with the level of EMF. For all possible scenarios of EMF indices, functional trait diversity metrics, especially functional divergence and functional richness correlated positively with EMF. On the other hand, functional dominance also influenced EMF, but played limited role in mediating EMF response to species richness, when compared with functional diversity. Results further revealed that total diversity effects, not species richness effect, generally increased with the level of EMF. In summary, we show that species richness does not fully capture the functional contribution of different species. Compared to dominance, trait diversity had significant advantage in explaining biodiversity-EMF relationship, stressing a greater role of niche complementarity as mechanism underpinning delivery of multiple functions. We argue that functional dominance reflects more the competitive dominance of traits and species within a given community and therefore is more likely to have greater effects on single functions than on multifunctionality.","[Mensah, Sylvanus; Salako, Kolawole Valere; Kakai, Romain Glele] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 04 BP 1525, Cotonou, Benin; [Assogbadjo, Achille; Sinsin, Brice] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Ecol Appliquee, 03 BP 1974, Cotonou, Benin; [Seifert, Thomas] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest Growth & Dendroecol, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Seifert, Thomas] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",University of Abomey Calavi; University of Abomey Calavi; University of Freiburg; Stellenbosch University,"Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 04 BP 1525, Cotonou, Benin.",sylvanus.m89@gmail.com,"Seifert, Thomas/AAW-1576-2021","Seifert, Thomas/0000-0002-9611-6272; Mensah, Sylvanus/0000-0001-6838-749X; Salako, Kolawole Valere/0000-0002-7817-3687","SHARE Intra-ACP; National Research Foundation of South Africa through the project Catchman Letaba; African Forest Forum through the research grant on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry linked to Climate Change; Research Division of Stellenbosch University; EU","SHARE Intra-ACP; National Research Foundation of South Africa through the project Catchman Letaba; African Forest Forum through the research grant on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry linked to Climate Change; Research Division of Stellenbosch University; EU(European Commission)","The data used in this study was collected during SM doctoral research supported by the SHARE Intra-ACP, the National Research Foundation of South Africa through the project Catchman Letaba and the African Forest Forum through the research grant on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry linked to Climate Change.

Ecosystem functions such as primary or secondary production may be maximized by species richness, evenness in species abundances, or the presence or dominance of species with certain traits. Here, we combine surveys of natural fish communities (conducted in July and August 2016) with morphological trait data to examine relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function (quantified as fish community biomass) across 14 subtidal eelgrass meadows in the Northeast Pacific (54 degrees N, 130 degrees W). We employ both taxonomic and functional trait measures of diversity to investigate whether ecosystem function is best predicted by species diversity (complementarity hypothesis) or by the presence or dominance of species with particular trait values (selection or dominance hypotheses). After controlling for environmental variation, we find that fish community biomass is maximized when taxonomic richness and functional evenness are low, and in communities dominated by species with particular trait values, specifically those associated with benthic habitats and prey capture. While previous work on fish communities has found that species richness is often positively correlated with ecosystem function, our results instead highlight the capacity for regionally prevalent and locally dominant species to drive ecosystem function in moderately diverse communities. We discuss these alternate links between community composition and ecosystem function and consider their divergent implications for ecosystem valuation and conservation prioritization.","[Eger, Aaron M.; Baum, Julia K.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Best, Rebecca J.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Eger, Aaron M.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Victoria; Northern Arizona University; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Eger, AM (autor correspondente), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",aaron.eger@unsw.edu.au,"; Best, Rebecca J/D-2934-2013","Baum, Julia/0000-0002-9827-1612; Eger, Aaron/0000-0003-0687-7340; Best, Rebecca J/0000-0003-2103-064X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; World Wildlife Fund of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); World Wildlife Fund of Canada,"We acknowledge funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada in the form of a graduate scholarship, Discovery Grants, and Engage Grants.

To fill this knowledge gap, we translocated monoliths hosting communities with four and 16 sown species from a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment ('The Jena Experiment') into a controlled environment facility for ecosystem research (Ecotron). This allowed quantifying the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem C fluxes as well as three parameters of C uptake efficiency (water and nitrogen use efficiencies and apparent quantum yield). By combining data on ecosystem C fluxes with vegetation structure and functional trait-based predictors, we found that increasing plant species and functional diversity led to higher gross and net ecosystem C uptake rates.

However, multiple alternate classifications exist in which the number of functional groups, the number of species per functional group, and the grouping of species differ from the a priori scheme. Without assessing the relative precision, or ability of an a priori scheme to accurately predict ecosystem functioning relative to its many alternatives, the validity and utility of analyses based on a single a priori classification scheme remains unclear. We examine the precision of a priori classifications used in 10 experimental grassland systems in Europe and the United States that have found evidence for a significant role of functional plant diversity in governing ecosystem function. The predictive precision of the a priori classifications employed in these studies was seldom significantly higher than the precision of random classifications. Post-hoc classification schemes that performed well in predicting ecosystem function resembled each other more with regard to species composition than average classifications, but there was still considerable variability in the manner in which these classification schemes grouped species. These results suggest that we need a more nuanced understanding of how the diversity of functional traits of species in an assemblage affects ecosystem functioning.","Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27706 USA; Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",Duke University; Columbia University; University of Zurich; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Wright, JP (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",jw67@duke.edu,"Wright, Justin/AAG-6461-2019; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Tilman, David/ABD-5309-2021","Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,NA,36,188,200,6,178,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

To do so, we performed a short-term greenhouse experiment using saplings to estimate the importance of above- and below-ground traits in modulating soil and water quality. Above-ground traits yielded stronger effects on soil and water quality than below-ground traits. Above-ground biomass held the strongest positive effect on ecosystem multifunctionality, being the most beneficial attribute for the soil functions assessed.

Functional traits can be used to describe the composition of communities through indices that seek to explain the factors that drive community assembly, biotic effects on ecosystem processes or both. Appropriately representing functional composition is therefore essential for predicting the consequences of environmental context and management actions for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in heterogeneous landscapes. 2. Functional indices can be constructed from single or multiple traits; however, it is not clear how they differ in information content or ability to predict biodiversity - ecosystem function relationships in complex landscapes. Here, we compare the utility of analogous single-and multi-trait indices in linking environmental variation and functional composition to ESs in a heterogeneous landscape, relating functional indices based on three plant traits [height, relative growth rate and root density (RD)] to variation in the physical environment and to two ESs (forage production and soil carbon) and their net ES level. 3. Two orthogonal gradients, elevation and soil bulk density (BD), explained significant variation in several dimensions of functional composition comprised of single traits. These traits in turn significantly predicted variation in ESs and their net values. Only one index measured with multiple traits (functional richness) varied with the physical environment, while none predicted variation in ES or net ES levels. 4. One ES, soil carbon, increased with the community-average value of RD, while the other, forage production, was related to the range and community-average value of height. In turn, average RD increased with soil BD while the average and range of height declined with elevation. Due to these environmental patterns, soil carbon and forage production did not covary strongly, leading to moderate net ES levels across the landscape. 5. Synthesis: Single-trait indices of functional composition best linked variation in environmental gradients with productivity and soil carbon. Because the environment-trait functioning relationships were independent of one another, the ESs were independently distributed across the landscape, providing little evidence of synergies or trade-offs. Single-and multi-trait indices contained unique information about functional composition of these communities, and both are likely to have a place in predicting variation in ESs under different scenarios.","[Butterfield, Bradley J.; Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Butterfield, BJ (autor correspondente), No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, 800 S Beaver St,Peterson Hall 330, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",Bradley.Butterfield@nau.edu,"Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176",,,,NA,53,126,135,6,205,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

However, the relative importance of functional versus taxonomic diversity in predicting aboveground biomass during restoration is poorly studied. Here, we used a trait-based approach to test for the importance of multiple plant diversity attributes in regulating aboveground biomass in a 30-years-old restored subtropical forest in southern China. We show that both taxonomic and functional diversities are significant and positive regulators of aboveground biomass; however, functional diversity (FD) was more important than taxonomic diversity (species richness) in controlling aboveground biomass. FD had the strongest direct effect on aboveground biomass compared with species richness, soil nutrients, and community weighted mean (CWM) traits. Our results further indicate that leaf and root morphological traits and traits related to the nutrient content in plant tissues represent the existence of a leaf and root economic spectrum, and the acquisitive resource use strategy influenced aboveground biomass. Our results suggest that both taxonomic and FD play a role in shaping aboveground biomass, but FD is more important in supporting aboveground biomass in this type of environments. These results imply that enhancing FD is important to restoring and managing degraded forest landscapes.","[Abu Hanif, Md.; Yu, Qingshui; Rao, Xingquan; Shen, Weijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Abu Hanif, Md.; Yu, Qingshui; Rao, Xingquan; Shen, Weijun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Abu Hanif, Md.] Hajee Mohammad Danesh Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Agroforestry & Environm, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh; [Yu, Qingshui] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc,Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Peking University","Shen, WJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.;Shen, WJ (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China.",hanif_hstu@yahoo.com; yuqingshui@pku.edu.cn; rxq99@scbg.ac.cn; shenweij@scbg.ac.cn,"; Shen, Weijun/G-2942-2010","Hanif, Md Abu/0000-0002-1541-5650; Shen, Weijun/0000-0001-7574-8839","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31425005, 31290222, 31130011]; CAS-TWAS President's PhD Fellowship Program, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Ten Thousand Talents Program; Guangdong Province Baiqianwan Talents Program","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS-TWAS President's PhD Fellowship Program, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Ten Thousand Talents Program; Guangdong Province Baiqianwan Talents Program","The research project was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31425005, 31290222, and 31130011), the CAS-TWAS President's PhD Fellowship Program, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Ten Thousand Talents Program, and the Guangdong Province Baiqianwan Talents Program.",NA,49,8,11,4,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,DEC,2019,8,12,,,,NA,,,612,10.3390/plants8120612,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants8120612,NA,,20,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,KB7CN,31888237,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000506648700086,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overgrazing has resulted in widespread decline in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands world-wide in recent decades. However, few studies have examined the patterns and thresholds of grazing-induced changes in community structure and ecosystem functioning along a grazing gradient and based on species-level responses and plant functional traits. 2. To identify the thresholds of grazing intensity (GI) at both species and community levels, we conducted a grazing manipulation experiment with seven levels of GI (0-9 sheep ha(-1)) and two topographies (flat vs. slope) in a typical steppe. Four plant functional traits were measured, including specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and stem: leaf ratio. 3. The threshold of GI that significantly altered community composition was at 3.75 sheep ha(-1) for the flat system and 3.0 sheep ha(-1) for the slope system. For both flat and slope systems, the threshold GI for changes in primary productivity was at 3.0 sheep ha(-1), beyond which the productivity decreased substantially. 4. At the species level, the abundances of common species, most of which are perennial grasses, declined at moderate grazing intensities (3.0-4.5 sheep ha(-1)). The abundances of most rare species, which are perennial forbs, declined at low grazing intensities (1.5-3 .0 sheep ha(-1)). SLA and LNC are good predictors of species-level responses to grazing. Low SLA and high LNC species are negatively affected by high GI, while high SLA and low LNC species are little affected by grazing. The negative effect of GI on species' abundance was greater in the slope system than in the flat system. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that the structural and functioning thresholds of grazing intensity depend on plant traits and species composition, which is mediated by topographic location. These findings, integrating plant functional traits and threshold approaches, have important implications for determining sustainable grazing intensity in grassland management and biodiversity conservation in semi-arid regions.","[Li, Wenhuai; Xu, Fengwei; Zheng, Shuxia; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Xu, Fengwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Taube, Friedhelm] Univ Kiel, Inst Crop Sci & Plant Breeding, Grass & Forage Sci Organ Agr, Hermann Rodewald Str 9, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Kiel","Bai, YF (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Li, Wenhuai/A-1268-2015","Li, Wenhuai/0000-0002-1113-2020; Taube, Friedhelm/0000-0001-7175-2881",State Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500804]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31320103916]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050400],State Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We are very grateful to David Hooper, Hans Cornelissen, Takehiro Sasaki and Scott Collins for their comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

We ask two questions: (1) Does phylogenetic diversity contain additional information not explained by functional traits? And (2) What are the strength and nature of the correlation between phylogeny and functional traits according to the evolutionary scale considered? We used data from permanent forest plots of northeastern Canada for which these links have been demonstrated and important functional traits identified. We show that the nature of the relationship between traits and phylogeny varies dramatically among traits, but also according to the evolutionary distance considered. The demonstration that different characters show phylogenetic autocorrelation at different evolutionary depths suggests that phylogenetic content of traits may be too crude to determine whether phylogenies contain relevant information. However, our study provides support for the use of phylogenies to assess ecosystem functioning when key functional traits are unavailable. We also highlight a potentially important contribution of phylogenetics for conservation and the study of the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and the provision of services, given the accumulating evidence that mechanisms promoting diversity effects shift over time to involve different traits.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Joly, Simon] Jardin Botan Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Joly, Simon] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret & Temperee, Ripon, PQ JOV 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, POB 8888,Ctr Ville Stn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,,"Joly, Simon/0000-0002-0865-8267",NSERC; NSERC-Hydro-Quebec Chair on tree growth,NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC-Hydro-Quebec Chair on tree growth,"Financial support for this research came from NSERC discovery grants to SJ and CM, as well as the NSERC-Hydro-Quebec Chair on tree growth (CM).",NA,64,30,31,1,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the contribution of intraspecific variability to ecosystem functions in the face of global change remains unknown. We quantified the relative contribution of intra- and inter-specific functional changes on productivity in 48 plots subjected to eight years of nitrogen addition and warming in a Tibetan alpine meadow. The change of the mean (community weighted mean) and the variation (Rao's quadratic entropy) in trait values in response to nitrogen addition and warming were separated into the changes driven by interspecific and intraspecific trait variations using a variance partitioning method. We found that productivity showed a hump-shaped response to nitrogen addition, with the highest productivity at intermediate levels of nitrogen addition. This hump-shaped response was mediated by the changes in plant functional structure. A community having higher interspecific variation in plant height and individuals producing bigger leaf area can increase productivity via niche complementary and dominance effects, respectively. Warming reduced productivity directly and marginally decreased individuals' leaf area which suppressed productivity indirectly. Our research suggests a non-negligible role of plant intraspecific trait variability in maintaining ecosystem functions, especially in the face of global change.","[Zhang, Li; Huang, Mengjiao] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Inst Ecochongming SIEC, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Coastal Ecosyst Res Stn Yangtze River Estuary,Mini, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li; Huang, Mengjiao] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Bamboo Res Inst, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Cappelli, Seraina Lisa] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Liu, Xiang; Xiao, Yao] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Ecol, State Key Lab Herbage Improvement & Grassland Agro, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Cardou, Francoise] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Biol Sci Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rong, Yizhong] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shurong] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special For, Minist Educ, Haikou, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Nanjing Forestry University; University of Zurich; Lanzhou University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Anhui Agricultural University; Hainan University,"Zhou, SR (autor correspondente), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special For, Minist Educ, Haikou, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/AAP-3415-2020; Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017","Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/0000-0002-8141-404X; Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Xiao, Yao/0000-0003-2044-6993; Cardou, Francoise/0000-0002-6527-9212",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31830009]; Hainan University (KYQD (ZR)) [20081]; Nanjing Forestry University [163100030],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University (KYQD (ZR)); Nanjing Forestry University,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31830009), Hainan University (KYQD (ZR) - 20081) and Nanjing Forestry University (163100030).",NA,50,0,0,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,,NA,NA,,,,,NA,,,,10.1111/oik.09559,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.09559,NA,jan.-23,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,7N7YV,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000907552000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although traditionally used in (semi)-natural situations, its concepts and methods could certainly apply to address key issues in the large variety of agricultural systems encountered across the world. In this review, we present major advances in comparative plant functional ecology that were made possible over the last two decades by the rapid development of a trait-based approach to plant functioning and prospects to apply it in agricultural situations. The strength of this approach is that it enables us to assess the interactions between organisms and their environment simultaneously on a large number of species, a prerequisite to address questions relative to species distribution, community assembly and ecosystem functioning. The trait concept will be first defined, before presenting a conceptual framework to understand the effects of environmental factors on plant community structure and ecosystem properties via plant traits. We will then argue that leading dimensions of variation among species can be captured by some selected traits and show that a combination of three easily measured traits-specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass), plant height and seed mass-enables us to assess how different species use their resources, interact with neighbours and disperse in time and space. The use of traits to address central questions in community ecology will be reviewed next. It will be shown that traits allow us to (1) understand how plant species are sorted according to the nature of environmental gradients, (2) evaluate the relative importance of habitat filtering and limiting similarity in the process of community assembly and (3) quantify two main components of community functional structure, namely, community-weighted means of traits and community functional divergence. The relative impacts of these two components on ecosystem properties will then be discussed in the case of several components of primary productivity, litter decomposition, soil water content and carbon sequestration. There is strong support for the biomass ratio hypothesis, which states that the extent to which the traits of a species affect those ecosystem properties depends on the abundance of this species in the community. Assessing the role of functional divergence among species on ecosystem properties will require major methodological breakthroughs, both in terms of metrics and statistical procedures to be used. In agricultural situations, we show that trait-based approaches have been successfully developed to assess the impacts of management practices on (1) the agronomic value of grasslands and (2) the functional composition and structure of crop weed communities and how these could affect the functioning of the crop. Applications in forestry are still poorly developed, especially in temperate regions where the number of species in managed forest remains relatively low. The last decades of research have led to the constitution of large data sets of plant traits, which remain poorly compatible and accessible. Recent advances in the field of ecoinformatics suggest that major progress could be achieved in this area by using improved metadata standards and advancing trait domain ontologies. Finally, concluding remarks, unanswered questions and directions for research using the functional approach to biodiversity made possible by the use of traits will be discussed in the contexts of ecological and agronomical systems. The latter indeed cover a wide range of environmental conditions and biological diversity, and the prospect for reducing environmental impacts in highly productive, low-diversity systems will certainly imply improving our skills for the management of more diverse systems prone to a trait-based approach as reviewed here.","[Garnier, Eric] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Navas, Marie-Laure] Montpellier SupAgro, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Garnier, E (autor correspondente), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",eric.garnier@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012; Garnier, Eric/CAH-9875-2022","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",,,,NA,298,289,307,32,691,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

Historical conceptual divisions in ecology are dissolving as ecologists seek general currencies for understanding plant function, population dynamics, species interactions and ecosystem processes. Foremost among such synthetic approaches are population-ecosystem models (PEMs), which treat the biomass dynamics of individuals as a foundation for coupled demographic and biogeochemical processes. 2. Because plant productivity and tissue composition drive terrestrial energy and nutrient cycling, and plant growth itself is often used as a fitness proxy, PEMs predict that phenomena related to population dynamics, such as species coexistence, are associated with processes at the ecosystem level. I argue that this line of thought reflects a persistent misunderstanding of the relationship of plant growth-the creation of new structural biomass- and individual fitness. 3. A survey of measured energetic costs of a wide variety of plant functions suggests that the majority of assimilated energy for many plants is allocated to survival rather than growth processes. This diversion of assimilate to survival-such as fighting infection, reducing potential tissue damage, or storing reserves in the face of defoliation risk-contributes to individual fitness but may not impact the flow of energy and nutrients in the environment or to other trophic levels. 4. Synthesis. Using simple models of plant energy budgets, I demonstrate how incorporating survival allocation into PEMs using a bet-hedging approach can decouple population and ecosystem dynamics. In revisiting what little is known about how individual plants use energy, I suggest that recasting plant strategy theory in an energetic-demographic framework may offer a useful way forward in the drive to unify population and ecosystem processes.","[Fridley, Jason D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Fridley, JD (autor correspondente), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",fridley@syr.edu,,,U.S.-New Zealand Fulbright Scholarship,U.S.-New Zealand Fulbright Scholarship,"I am indebted to many colleagues who provided advice, discussion and manuscript comments, including L.

FD has received ample theoretical attention, but empirical studies are limited. We evaluate changes in species richness and FD during tropical secondary forest succession after shifting cultivation in Mexico. We also test whether species richness is a good predictor of FD. FD was calculated based on a combination of nine functional traits, and based on two individual traits important for primary production (specific leaf area) and carbon sequestration (wood density). Stand basal area was a good predictor of successional changes in diversity and FD, in contrast to fallow age. Incidence-based FD indices increased logarithmically with stand basal area, but FD weighted by species' importance values lacked pattern with succession. Species richness and diversity are strong predictors of FD when all traits were considered; linear relationships indicate that all species are equally functionally complementary, suggesting there is little functional redundancy. In contrast, when FD was calculated for individual traits and weighted for abundances, species richness may underestimate FD. Selection of functional trait(s) critically determines FD, with large consequences for studies relating biodiversity to ecosystem functioning. Careful consideration of the traits required to capture the ecosystem process of interest is thus essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that plant traits can provide such a link. Using subalpine grasslands in the central French Alps as a case study, we investigate the response of plant traits to changes in soil resource availability and disturbance regimes associated with changing grassland management as well as the effects of changes in plant traits on measured ecosystem properties. We found that fertilization leads to greater specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content which leads to greater productivity and faster litter decomposition, and that grazing leads to higher leaf toughness and leaf dry matter content which leads to lower productivity and slower decomposition compared to mowing. A state and transition model was used as a flexible conceptual tool for integrating data on community composition, plant traits, and ecosystem properties in the context of management-mediated successional dynamics in subalpine grasslands. Focusing on the biology driving the transition between grassland states, we incorporated plant traits into the formulation of a state and transition model and demonstrated how they could be used to provide a mechanistic link between community shifts and ecosystem properties under complex management regimes with strong land-use legacies.","Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMS 2925, Stn Alpine Joseph Fourier, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Quetier, F (autor correspondente), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, IMBIV, Catedra Biogeog, Velez Sarsfield 299, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",fabien.quetier@ujf-grenoble.fr,"Quétier, Fabien/U-3432-2019; Quétier, Fabien/K-6872-2015","Quétier, Fabien/0000-0002-3767-0353; Quétier, Fabien/0000-0002-3767-0353",,,,NA,132,197,207,10,230,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, the distinct effect of each pathway on ecosystem function is difficult to determine as they are complementary and shaped by environmental heterogeneity. We examined the distinct effects of functional diversity (FD) and identity (FI) on water consumption and use efficiency (WUE), vegetative and reproductive biomass production and reorganization capacity under variable water availability. Methods Eight semiarid annual plant species, varying in natural size range, were grown in different assemblages representing various levels of FD and FI. Assemblages were based on species potential growth rate (PGR) and grown under two water availability levels. We measured total biomass, seed biomass, root to shoot ratio and water consumption. Results FD had a distinct positive effect on water consumption, total biomass and seed production but not on WUE. Mean PGR (FI) had a distinct positive effect on water consumption and total biomass production, but a negative effect on WUE and seed production. FD and FI had no clear effects on reorganization capacity or stability in total biomass production in response to decreased water availability. Conclusions We present the discrete contributions of FD and FI to ecosystem function. The positive effect of FD on biomass production reflects better exploitation of the growing space and reduced competition through greater size diversity, emphasizing the importance of interplant interactions and differentiation for enhancing ecosystem function. The positive effect of FI on biomass production reflects the higher performance of high PGR species, albeit at the expense of WUE and seed production resulting from higher competition.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Dovrat, Guy] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Albert Katz Int Sch Desert Studies, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Volcani Ctr, Bet Dagan, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Dovrat, G (autor correspondente), Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science Foundation [861/09],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 861/09",NA,40,6,6,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two-and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.","[Flynn, Dan F.

It remains unclear how functional diversity affects the productivity of aquatic plant communities with different life-forms. We constructed free-floating plant communities dominated by Salvinia natans and submerged plant communities dominated by Vallisneria natans to explore the effects of disturbance (clonal fragmentation) on functional diversity-productivity relationships under different nutrient availability. Results showed that, in free-floating plant communities, disturbance had significant impacts on three community-weighted means traits (average leaf length, average leaf width and average root length), functional evenness (FEve) and productivity under high nutrient conditions. Three single-trait indices and FEve showed reverse correlations with productivity. In submerged plant communities, disturbance-induced considerable variations of single- and multi-trait indices and inapparent variation of productivity. Functional evenness was negatively related to community productivity under low nutrient conditions. Our results suggest that mechanisms of mass ratio and niche complementarity can simultaneously explain variations in free-floating plant community productivity under high nutrient conditions. Niche complementarity had a weak explanatory power for variations in submerged plant community productivity under low nutrient conditions. Our study provides the first evidence for the non-negligible role of nutrients and life-forms in functional diversity-productivity relationships of aquatic plant communities.","[Ma, Xiaowen; Wang, Qiuyue; Wang, Huiyuan; Li, Dexiang; Li, Fuchao; Yu, Dan; Liu, Chunhua] Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Liu, CH (autor correspondente), Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",liuchh@163.com,"Wang, Qiuyue/HKD-3773-2023","liu, chunhua/0000-0002-3932-477X",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),The authors gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2042020kf1025),NA,66,0,0,15,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,FEB,2023,850,3,,,,NA,683,697,,10.1007/s10750-022-05118-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05118-x,NA,DEC 2022,15,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,8E0LW,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000900944700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conflicting hypotheses suggest that plant traits within communities should show divergence to reflect strategies to reduce competition or convergence to reflect strong selection for the environmental conditions operating. Further hypotheses suggest that plant traits related to productivity show convergence within communities, but those related to disturbance show divergence. Data on functional diversity (FDvar) of 12 traits from 30 communities ranging from arable fields, mown and grazed grasslands to moorland and woodland were employed to test this using randomisations tests and correlation and regression analysis. No traits showed consistent significant convergence or divergence in functional diversity. When correlated to measures of the environment, the most common pattern was for functional diversity to decline (7 out of 12 traits) and the degree of convergence (7 out of 12 traits) to increase as the levels of productivity (measured as primary productivity, soil nitrogen release and vegetation C:N) and disturbance increased. Convergence or a relationship between functional diversity and the environment was not seen for a number of important traits, such as LDMC and SLA, which are considered as key predictors of ecosystem function. The analysis indicates that taking into account functional diversity within a system may be a necessary part of predicting the relationship between plant traits and ecosystem function, and that this may be of particular importance within less productive and less disturbed systems.","[Pakeman, Robin J.; Lennon, Jack J.; Brooker, Rob W.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk,"Lennon, Jack J/C-1973-2013; Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015","Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133",,,,NA,51,47,51,4,108,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,2011,167,1,,,,NA,209,218,,10.1007/s00442-011-1980-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-1980-6,NA,,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,807QE,21476032,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000293914000021,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In North American shortgrass prairie, we measured plant abundance, functional traits related to growth rate and drought tolerance, and aboveground net primary productivity to identify: species-level responsiveness to precipitation (precipitation sensitivity S-spp) across functional groups; S-spp relationships to continuous plant traits; and whether continuous trait-S-spp relationships scaled to the community level. Across 32 plant species, we found strong bivariate relationships of both leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf osmotic potential psi(osm) with S-spp. Yet, LDMC and specific leaf area were retained in the lowest Akaike information criterion multiple regression model, explaining 59% of S-spp. Most relationships between continuous traits and S-spp scaled to the community level but were often contingent on the presence/absence of particular species and/or land management at a site. Thus, plant communities in shortgrass prairie may shift towards slower growing, more stress-resistant species in drought years and/or chronically drier climate. These findings highlight the importance of both leaf economic and drought tolerance traits in determining species and community responses to altered precipitation.","[Wilcox, Kevin R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Wilcox, Kevin R.; Blumenthal, Dana M.; Kray, Julie A.; Porensky, Lauren M.] USDA ARS, Crops Res Lab, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Mueller, Kevin E.] Cleveland State Univ, Biol Geol & Environm Sci, 2121 Euclid Ave,SI 219, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Derner, Justin D.] USDA ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, 8408 Hildreth Rd, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; [Ocheltree, Troy] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Wyoming; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Colorado State University,"Wilcox, KR (autor correspondente), Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.;Wilcox, KR (autor correspondente), USDA ARS, Crops Res Lab, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",kevin.wilcox@uwyo.edu,"; Wilcox, Kevin/D-7281-2013","Blumenthal, Dana/0000-0001-7496-0766; Ocheltree, Troy/0000-0002-7707-5639; Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736; Wilcox, Kevin/0000-0001-6829-1148; Mueller, Kevin/0000-0002-0739-7472",US Department of Agriculture,US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We would like to thank Julie Bushey, Mary Carlson, Brenda Castlemain, Kelly Chesus, Paula Johnson, Caitlyn Kraft, Dan LeCain, Lauren Mancini, Christina Swope, Nicole Reese, Seth Romero, Dan Spitzer, Nick Whitehill, and Courtney Youngberg for collecting plant trait data, and Mary Ashby, Jeff Thomas, Matt Mortenson, and numerous students for collecting long-term vegetation data.

We combined different biodiversity measures (functional, phylogenetic, richness, evenness) in generalized linear models to determine which combinations provided the most parsimonious explanations of variation in biomass production. Although multivariate functional diversity indices alone consistently explained more variation in productivity than other single measures, phylogenetic diversity and plant height represented the most parsimonious combination.

Yet, in heterogeneous forests, ecosystem function of different strata could be associated with traits or evolutionary relationships differently. Here, we integrate phylogenies and traits to evaluate the effects of elevational diversity on above-ground biomass across forest strata and spatial scales. Community-weighted means of height and leaf phosphorous concentration and functional diversity in specific leaf area exhibited positive correlations with tree biomass, suggesting that both positive selection effects and complementarity occur. However, high shrub biomass is associated with greater dissimilarity in seed mass and multidimensional trait space, while species richness or phylogenetic diversity is the most important predictor for herbaceous biomass, indicating that species complementarity is especially important for understory function. The strength of diversity-biomass relationships increases at larger spatial scales. We conclude that strata- and scale- dependent assessments of community structure and function are needed to fully understand how biodiversity influences ecosystem function.","[Luo, Ya-Huang; Burgess, Kevin S.; Liu, Jie; Tan, Shao-Lin; Zou, Jia-Yun; Gao, Lian-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Ya-Huang; Li, De-Zhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Germplasm Bank Wild Species Southwest China, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Biol Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Burgess, Kevin S.] Univ Syst Georgia, Columbus State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, Dept Biol, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Tan, Shao-Lin; Zou, Jia-Yun; Li, De-Zhu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Coll Life Sci, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Kun; Gao, Lian-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Lijiang Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Kunming Inst Bot, Lijiang 674100, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS","Gao, LM (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Li, DZ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Germplasm Bank Wild Species Southwest China, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Li, DZ (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Coll Life Sci, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Gao, LM (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Lijiang Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Kunming Inst Bot, Lijiang 674100, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",dzl@mail.kib.ac.cn; gaolm@mail.kib.ac.cn,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020; Li, De-Zhu/G-8203-2011; Tan, Shao-Lin/GQQ-1238-2022; Gao, Lian-Ming/AAU-2613-2021; Gao, Lianming/H-4527-2011; Zou, Jia-Yun/HNO-9810-2023","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; Li, De-Zhu/0000-0002-4990-724X; Tan, Shao-Lin/0000-0001-9977-7773; Gao, Lian-Ming/0000-0001-9047-2658; Gao, Lianming/0000-0001-9047-2658; Zou, Jia-Yun/0000-0001-6927-2782; Luo, Ya-Huang/0000-0002-0073-419X","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31010000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31800354]; China Postdoctoral Science Fundation [2017M623082]; Program of Science and Technology Talents Training of Yunnan Province, China [2017HA014]; Postdoctoral targeted funding from Yunnan Province","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Fundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Program of Science and Technology Talents Training of Yunnan Province, China; Postdoctoral targeted funding from Yunnan Province","We are grateful to all the staff from Lijiang Forest Ecosystem Research Station and Xin-Feng Liao, Zhi-Qiong Mo and Zu-Chang Xu for their help with field data collection.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to synthesize current knowledge about and ecosystem function and services along with their linkages to PFTs in temperate forest ecosystem. A systematic literature review with appropriate keywords and suitable inclusion and exclusion criterion was applied for generating of the information in accordance to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Forty-eight studies (31 on functional traits and 17 on linkages of PFT with various ecosystem services) reveals that aboveground biomass and wood productivity was associated with leaf morphological, chemical and stem traits, however, only a few studies dealt with leaf physiological, stoichiometry, regenerative and root traits. Litter decomposition was mostly associated with leaf chemical and morphological traits followed by leaf physiological and stoichiometry traits; however, evaluations between PFTs and ecosystem services (ESs) were categorically not accounted the association with stem, root and regenerative traits in temperate forests. Leaf morphological, chemical, stoichiometry and stem traits were important predictors of ecosystem process and functioning and facilitate for the measurements of ecosystem services. However, limited and skewed studies suggest more focus researches on physiological, regenerative and root traits in temperate forest for assessing the unexplored services.

There are theoretical reasons for predicting that species that differ in intraspecific trait variability will also differ in their effects on ecosystem functioning, particularly in variable environments. We discuss whether species with greater trait variability are likely to exhibit greater temporal stability in their population dynamics, and under which conditions this might lead to stability in ecosystem functioning. Resolving this requires us to consider several questions. First, are species with high levels of variation for one trait equally variable in others? In particular, is variability in response and effects traits typically correlated? Second, what is the relative contribution of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to trait variability? If local adaptation dominates, then stability in function requires one of two conditions: (i) individuals of appropriate phenotypes present in the environment at high enough frequencies to allow for populations to respond rapidly to the changing environment, and (ii) high levels of dispersal and gene flow. While we currently lack sufficient information on the causes and distribution of variability in functional traits, filling in these key data gaps should increase our ability to predict how changing biodiversity will alter ecosystem functioning.","[Wright, Justin P.; Ames, Gregory M.; Mitchelll, Rachel M.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Wright, Justin P.] Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res & Systemat Bot, Maulbeerallee 2a, Potsdam, Germany",Duke University; University of Potsdam,"Wright, JP (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Wright, JP (autor correspondente), Univ Potsdam, Dept Biodivers Res & Systemat Bot, Maulbeerallee 2a, Potsdam, Germany.",jw67@duke.edu,"Wright, Justin/AAG-6461-2019","Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347; Mitchell, Rachel/0000-0002-0867-9068; Ames, Gregory/0000-0003-4893-5318","US Army Engineer Research Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) [W9132T-11-2-0008]; NSF [DBI 1401800]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1401800] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US Army Engineer Research Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","J.W. and G.A. were supported by the US Army Engineer Research Development Center, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) (cooperative agreement no.

To address this knowledge gap, we combined a lysimeter setup in a controlled environment facility (Ecotron) with large ecosystem samples/monoliths originating from a long-term biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and a modeling approach. Our goals were (1) quantifying the impact of plant species richness (four vs. 16 species) on day- and nighttime ecosystem water vapor fluxes; (2) partitioning ecosystem evapotranspiration into evaporation and plant transpiration using the Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) energy partitioning model; and (3) identifying the most parsimonious predictors of water vapor fluxes using plant functional-trait-based metrics such as functional diversity and community weighted means. Daytime measured and modeled evapotranspiration were significantly higher in the higher plant diversity treatment, suggesting increased water acquisition. The SW model suggests that, at low plant species richness, a higher proportion of the available energy was diverted to evaporation (a non-productive flux), while, at higher species richness, the proportion of ecosystem transpiration (a productivity-related water flux) increased. While it is well established that LAI controls ecosystem transpiration, here we also identified that the diversity of leaf nitrogen concentration among species in a community is a consistent predictor of ecosystem water vapor fluxes during daytime. The results provide evidence that, at the peak of the growing season, higher leaf area index (LAI) and lower percentage of bare ground at high plant diversity diverts more of the available water to transpiration, a flux closely coupled with photosynthesis and productivity. Higher rates of transpiration presumably contribute to the positive effect of diversity on productivity.","[Milcu, Alexandru; Landais, Damien; Ravel, Olivier; Roy, Jacques] CNRS, Ecotron UPS 3248, Campus Baillarguet, F-34980 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Milcu, Alexandru] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CEFE,CNRS,UMR 5175,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Eugster, Werner; Bachmann, Dorte; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Guderle, Marcus; Hildebrandt, Anke] Univ Jena, Inst Geosci, Burgweg 11, D-07749 Jena, Germany; UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Gockele, Annette] Univ Freiburg, Geobot, Inst Biol 2, Schanzlestr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Lange, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoell Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Freiburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Max Planck Society; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Technical University of Munich","Milcu, A (autor correspondente), CNRS, Ecotron UPS 3248, Campus Baillarguet, F-34980 Montferrier Sur Lez, France.;Milcu, A (autor correspondente), Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CEFE,CNRS,UMR 5175,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",alex.milcu@cnrs.fr,"Hildebrandt, Anke/J-7062-2012; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Milcu, Alexandru/X-6267-2018","Hildebrandt, Anke/0000-0001-8643-1634; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Roy, Jacques/0000-0003-2275-9870; Milcu, Alexandru/0000-0002-2889-1234; Bachmann, Dorte/0000-0003-2171-3838","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [FOR 456]; ProExzellenz initiative of the German Federal State of Thuringia; ExpeER Transnational Access program [EU-FP7 I3]; SNF [315230E-131194]; Languedoc-Roussillon region; Herault Conseil General","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ProExzellenz initiative of the German Federal State of Thuringia; ExpeER Transnational Access program; SNF; Languedoc-Roussillon region(Region Occitanie); Herault Conseil General","We thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) for funding the Jena-Ecotron experiment (FOR 456) and A.

Tropical forests may also show different responses to a changing climate, with baseline climatic conditions potentially inducing differences in the strength and timing of responses to droughts. Trait-based approaches provide an opportunity to link functional composition, ecosystem function and environmental changes. We demonstrate the power of such approaches by presenting a novel analysis of long-term responses of different tropical forest to climatic changes along a rainfall gradient. We explore how key ecosystem's biogeochemical properties have shifted over time as a consequence of multi-decadal drying. Notably, we find that drier tropical forests have increased their deciduous species abundance and generally changed more functionally than forests growing in wetter conditions, suggesting an enhanced ability to adapt ecologically to a drying environment.","[Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus; Oliveras, Imma; Rifai, Sami; Gvozdevaite, Agne; Moore, Sam; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus] Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, Biodivers Dynam, Leiden, Netherlands; [Fauset, Sophie] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Adu-Bredu, Stephen; Peprah, Theresa] KNUST, CSIR Forestry Res Inst Ghana, Kumasi, Ghana; [Affum-Baffoe, Kofi] Forestry Commiss Ghana, Mensurat Unit, Kumasi, Ghana; [Baker, Timothy R.; Hubau, Wannes; Lewis, Simon L.; Phillips, Oliver L.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Ecol & Global Change, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Feldpausch, Ted R.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kraft, Nathan J.

To assess the resilience of this vegetation to drought and grazing, we undertook a trait-based approach using field inventory, historical survey databases, and traits data literature. Using a hierarchical clustering approach, we gathered the species present from 1970 to 2015 into functional groups according to their effect traits related to primary productivity and biogeochemical cycles. First, we studied the evolution of functional redundancy (FRe) and response diversity (RDiv) of the functional effect groups to drought and grazing, two indicators of resilience, since the 1970s. Second, we looked at the spatial variation of these two indices in 2015, according to local topography. FRe and RDiv of 80% of the functional groups examined declined since 1970, endangering the persistence of the studied functions. Local topography strongly influenced current FRe and RDiv, with depressions presenting higher values. Finally, by examining species' abundances, their regeneration, and the functional group to which they belong, we determined some key species that could benefit from protection to ensure the persistence of the ecosystem functions supported by the woody vegetation. This study has expanded knowledge about the savanna's response to pressures and has shown how a functional traits-based approach could be an effective tool to guide the management of tropical savannas.","[Dendoncker, Morgane; Vincke, Caroline] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Taugourdeau, Simon] PPZS, CIRAD, UMR, SELMET, Dakar, Senegal; [Taugourdeau, Simon] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro, SELMET, CIRAD,INRAE, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais UQO, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Dept Sci Nat, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Universite Catholique Louvain; CIRAD; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Universite de Montpellier; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Dendoncker, M (autor correspondente), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",morgane.dendoncker@uclouvain.be,,,,,,NA,166,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,FEB,2023,14,2,,,,NA,,,291,10.3390/f14020291,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14020291,NA,,23,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,9H0RD,NA,"gold, Green Published",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000938548100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across the temperate forest sub-set of this spectrum, we assess gradients in canopy structural traits, characterise canopy structural types (CST) and evaluate drivers and functional consequences of canopy structural variation. We derive CSTs from multivariate canopy structure data, illustrating variation along three primary structural axes and resolution into six largely distinct and functionally relevant CSTs. Our results illustrate that within-ecosystem successional processes and disturbance legacies can produce variation in canopy structure similar to that associated with sub-continental variation in forest types and eco-climatic zones.

However, how important these effects are in driving ecosystem multifunctionality in natural forests, relative to other drivers, such as below-ground biodiversity (e.g. soil microbial diversity), community-level functional traits and environmental conditions, remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that tree species or phylogenetic diversity (PD), stand structure, functional traits and soil microbial diversity jointly regulate temperate forest multifunctionality (FM) along a local-scale environmental gradient. Using repeated census data from a 25-ha old-growth temperate forest, we first quantified eight ecosystem functions and properties related to above- and below-ground nutrient cycling. We then used these to estimate ecosystem multifunctionality using both averaging and multiple threshold (50%, 75% and 95%) approaches. Finally, we used structural equation models to explore how different facets of tree (tree species, functional and PD) and soil (bacteria, fungi and nematode diversity) biodiversity influence ecosystem multifunctionality, as well as how these relationships are modulated by stand structural attributes and environmental conditions (topography and soil nutrients). Forest multifunctionality was positively related to stand structural complexity but negatively related to acquisitive traits (i.e. community-weighted mean of specific leaf area). Plant PD had no significant direct effect on FM, but it had a significant indirect effect via increased stand structural complexity. The effect of soil microbial diversity on FM increased with increasing threshold levels of FM and outperformed tree diversity and environmental conditions at the highest threshold level (i.e. 95%). Forests on steep slopes had lower levels of ecosystem multifunctionality due to decreased stand structural complexity. Soil nutrients were responsible for regulating FM via plant trait composition and, to a lesser extent, via tree diversity, stand structure and soil microbial diversity. Synthesis. Plant PD, stand structure and soil microbial diversity jointly regulated FM, and these effects were influenced by local-scale changes in environmental conditions. Soil microbial diversity was a key driver of highly multifunctional forests, whereas conservation of complex stand structure and conservative trait dominance could enhance mean values of multiple functions.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoke; Li, Hui; Hao, Zhanqing; Wang, Xugao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Medioambiente, Madrid, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Madrid, Spain; [Jucker, Tommaso] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mori, Akira S.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hao, Zhanqing] Northernwest Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Xian, Peoples R China; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, Moulis, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Nanjing Forestry University; Nanjing Forestry University; Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Alcala; University of Bristol; Yokohama National University; Peking University; Peking University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","Wang, XG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",wangxg@iae.ac.cn,"Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Li, Hui/AEA-0681-2022; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31730015, 31722010, 41671050]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2017241]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 31030000]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences [ZDBS-LY-DQC019]; Nanjing Forestry University [163010230]; UK NERC Independent Research Fellowship [NE/S01537X/1]; Fellowship 'Atraccion de Talento Investigador' [2016-T2/AMB-1665]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Nanjing Forestry University; UK NERC Independent Research Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Fellowship 'Atraccion de Talento Investigador'; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31730015, 31722010 and 41671050; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS, Grant/Award Number: 2017241; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB 31030000; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Grant/Award Number: ZDBS-LY-DQC019; Nanjing Forestry University, Grant/Award Number: 163010230; UK NERC Independent Research Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: NE/S01537X/1; Fellowship `Atraccion de Talento Investigador', Grant/Award Number: 2016-T2/AMB-1665; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41",NA,65,40,47,29,230,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Adopting a functional trait-based approach might overcome this context-dependence. As an early exploration of this approach, we used a greenhouse experiment with seeds of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera to assess the potential invasion effects on community trait composition and biomass production. Location: Three distant European seed origins, northern France, southern Sweden and central Norway, into transplanted turves from Trondheim, Norway. Methods: At the end of the greenhouse experiment, we measured plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and standing biomass of both the invasive plant and the turf communities. With these data we evaluated invasion effects on community trait composition and standing biomass (as a first test of ecosystem function effects), including dependence on invasive species origin and recipient community composition. Results: Invasion by I. glandulifera introduced divergent trait values (high plant height and SLA, low LDMC) to the recipient community. The trait set of both the invader and, to a lesser extent, the community were altered following invasion, seemingly driven by increased light competition. Competitive and graminoid-dominated communities showed stronger changes in LDMC following invasion. Functional traits of both the communities and the invasive species helped explain the increase in standing biomass. Southern invader plants more strongly affected the recipient community than their northern counterparts, resulting in stronger biomass reduction of the recipient community. Conclusions: This study shows how invasion-induced increases in productivity are effectuated through both the introduction of different invader traits and shifts in the co-occurring species trait set, illustrating the potential of a functional trait-based approach.","[Helsen, Kenny; Kapas, Rozalia E.; Rakvaag, Grete; Graae, Bente J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Trondheim, Norway; [Helsen, Kenny] Univ Leuven, Biol Dept, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Heverlee, Belgium; [Speed, James D.

We examined how precipitation changes affect community structure and aboveground biomass (AGB) according to manipulated precipitation experiments in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. Bayesian model and structural equation models (SEM) were used to test variation and causal relationship among precipitation, plant diversity, functional attributes, and AGB. The results showed that the responses of species richness, evenness, and plant community weighted means traits to precipitation changes in amount and year were significant. The SEM demonstrated that precipitation change in amount and year has a direct effect on richness, evenness, and community-weighted mean (CWM) for height, leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and leaf carbon content (LCC) and AGB; there into CWM for height and LDMC had a direct positive effect on AGB; LA had a direct negative effect on AGB. Three dominant species showed diverse adaptation and resource utilization strategies in response to precipitation changes. A. polyrhizum showed an increase in height under the precipitation treatments that promoted AGB, whereas the AGB of P. harmala and S. glareosa was boosted through alterations in height and LA. Our results highlight the asynchronism of variation in community composition and structure, leaf functional traits in precipitation-AGB relationship. We proposed that altered AGB resulted from the direct and indirect effects of plant functional traits (plant height, LA, LDMC) rather than species diversity, plant functional traits are likely candidate traits, given that they are mechanistically linked to precipitation changes and affected aboveground biomass in a desert steppe.","[Cheng, Huan; Gong, Yuanbo] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Huan] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zuo, Xiaoan] Chinese Acad Sci, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Gong, YB (autor correspondente), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",gyb@sicau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071140, 41622103]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071140 and 41622103).,NA,86,8,8,22,53,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

In this study, we related the trait composition of plant communities to soil nutrients and disturbance as environmental drivers and to productivity, decomposition and soil carbon as ecosystem properties. We surveyed two sites, one comprising intensively grazed and fertilized grasslands, the other consisting of semi-natural grassland and open heathland. Species abundance and trait values of 149 species were recorded in 69 plots, as well as parameters describing soil resources, land-use disturbances, and ecosystem properties. Our main goal was to test whether the average or the diversity of the trait values of the vegetation had stronger effects on ecosystem properties (mass ratio vs. diversity hypothesis). Structural equation modeling was used to perform a simultaneous analysis of trait responses and effects. Specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents were always negatively correlated with stem dry matter content and canopy height, indicating greater investments in supportive and nutrient-conserving tissue as plants increased in size. In the agricultural site, disturbance was the single most important factor decreasing plant height, while leaf traits such as specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents increased with soil resources in heathlands. Productivity was directly or indirectly driven by leaf traits, and investments in structural tissue increased standing biomass and soil carbon. Different environmental drivers in the two sites produced opposing leaf trait effects on litter decomposition. Ecosystem properties were explained by the community mean trait value as predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Evidence for effects of functional diversity on productivity and other ecosystem properties was not detected, suggesting that diversity productivity relationships depend on the length of the investigated environmental gradients. We conclude that changes in community composition and dominance hierarchies deserve the most attention when ecosystem properties must he maintained.","[Lienin, Patrick; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Lienin, P (autor correspondente), Univ Connecticut, Dept Plant Sci & Landscape Architecture, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",patrick.lienin@uconn.edu,,,"State of Lower-Saxony; Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany [ZN 2026]","State of Lower-Saxony; Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany(Volkswagen)","This study was conducted as part of a collaborative research project with the Hebrew University, Israel, and funded by the State of Lower-Saxony and the Volkswagen Foundation, Hannover, Germany (Grant No. ZN 2026).

It assumes that species traits are central to these impacts, and is designed to be applicable in different historical, climatic contexts and local settings. Preliminary results are presented to show its applicability. Methods Eleven sites, representative of various types of land-use changes occurring in marginal agro-ecosystems across Europe and Israel, were selected. Climatic data were obtained at the site level; soil data, disturbance and nutrition indices were described at the plot level within sites. Sixteen traits describing plant stature, leaf characteristics and reproductive phase were recorded on the most abundant species of each treatment. These data were combined with species abundance to calculate trait values weighed by the abundance of species in the communities. The ecosystem properties selected were components of above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition of litter. Key Results The wide variety of land-use systems that characterize marginal landscapes across Europe was reflected by the different disturbance indices, and were also reflected in soil and/or nutrient availability gradients. The trait toolkit allowed us to describe adequately the functional response of vegetation to land-use changes, but we suggest that some traits (vegetative plant height, stem dry matter content) should be omitted in studies involving mainly herbaceous species. Using the example of the relationship between leaf dry matter content and above-ground dead material, we demonstrate how the data collected may be used to analyse direct effects of climate and land use on ecosystem properties vs. indirect effects via changes in plant traits. Conclusions This work shows the applicability of a set of protocols that can be widely applied to assess the impacts of global change drivers on species, communities and ecosystems.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France; Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, Stn Alpine Joseph Fourier, UMS 2925, F-38042 Grenoble 09, France; INRA, Equipe ORPHEE, UMR 1248, ARCHE, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; Univ Coimbra, Dept Bot, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal; Univ S Bohemia, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Landscape Ecol Grp, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; Macaulay Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Lab Rangeland Ecol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Plant Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Universidade de Coimbra; Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Stockholm University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; James Hutton Institute; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Tel Aviv University; University of Sherbrooke,"Garnier, E (autor correspondente), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",eric.garnier@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Garnier, Eric/CAH-9875-2022; Freitas, Helena/ABE-6998-2020; Beemster, Gerrit/E-6668-2016; Robson, Thomas Matthew/J-3381-2012; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015; Doležal, Ji?í/H-1583-2014; Castro, Helena/AAO-6270-2021; Freitas, Helena/A-2803-2010; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012; Vile, Denis/A-5637-2008; Sternberg, Marcelo/AFQ-1615-2022; Quetier, Fabien/K-6872-2015","Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Beemster, Gerrit/0000-0001-6014-053X; Robson, Thomas Matthew/0000-0002-8631-796X; Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133; Castro, Helena/0000-0003-1818-1535; Freitas, Helena/0000-0002-1907-9615; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154; Vile, Denis/0000-0002-7948-1462; Sternberg, Marcelo/0000-0001-8710-4141; Golodets, Carly/0000-0001-6509-9716; Fortunel, Claire/0000-0002-8367-1605; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051; Rusch, Graciela/0000-0003-3769-8345; Quetier, Fabien/0000-0002-3767-0353",,,,NA,102,412,429,6,286,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

We evaluated how hydrological gradients (i.e., soil water content and elevation) affected the taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional diversity and assessed how changes in these measures of diversity ultimately drove variations in above-ground biomass (AGB). Results showed that a combination of hydrological gradients and functional trait composition (i.e., the community weighted means, the single-trait functional diversity and the multiple-trait functional diversity) better explained variations (40.8%) of AGB. No significant relationships between taxonomic diversity and AGB were observed. The dominant species became taller with thicker stem, and co-occurring species showed greater divergent distribution of stem diameter towards higher soil water content. As elevation increased, the dominant plant had thinner leaves with later onset of flowering and longer flowering duration, and co-occurring species showed less divergent distribution of lamina thickness and leaf dry-mass content. Our results highlighted that the positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations were largely attributed to the co-operations of selection and complementary effects, as evidences showed that the dominant trait values (i.e., community weighted mean of shoot height) and trait diversity (i.e., functional evenness) improved biomass production of wetland plants.","[Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang; Ge, Dabing; Zou, Dongsheng; Liu, Qiaolin; Wu, Aiping] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Inst Ecol, Ecol Dept, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Lou, Qian; Dai, Taotao; Yuan, Guixiang; Guo, Chunjing; Zhong, Jiayou; Hu, Jianmin] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Beijing East Rd 1038, Nanchang 330029, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Fang, Shaowen] Hydrol Bur Jiangxi Prov, Nanchang 330059, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Nanchang Inst Technol, Res Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha Res Stn Agr & Environm Monitoring, Key Lab Agroecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Beijing 410125, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenrong] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Hunan Agricultural University; Nanchang Institute Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Fu, H (autor correspondente), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Biosci & Biotechnol, Inst Ecol, Ecol Dept, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China.",huifu367@163.com,"Wu, Aiping/AAU-8710-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560145, 31770510, 31560148, 31400404, 31760148]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [20171BAB214006, 2015ZBBF6008, 20161BAB214153]; Science and Technology Program of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Resources [KT201509]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); Science and Technology Program of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Resources,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31560145, 31770510, 31560148, 31400404 and 31760148; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 20171BAB214006, 2015ZBBF6008 and 20161BAB214153; the Science and Technology Program of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Resources, Grant/Award Number: KT201509",NA,52,12,13,14,99,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,JUN,2018,11,4,,,,NA,,,e1950,10.1002/eco.1950,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.1950,NA,,9,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GI2RK,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000434219200013,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we know little about the underlying short-term evolutionary processes. Using five plant species selected for twelve years in a biodiversity experiment in mixture or monoculture and plants without such a selection history, we assessed whether differential selection altered productivity, biodiversity effects, and functional trait differences within newly assembled monocultures and 2-species mixtures. Plants without a past community selection history in the biodiversity experiment produced the lowest assemblage biomass and showed the weakest biodiversity effects. In newly assembled mixtures, plants with a selection history in mixtures produced more biomass than plants with a monoculture selection history. Biodiversity effects were generally positive and differed significantly between selection histories. However, contrary to our expectations, biodiversity effects were not stronger for mixture-type plants. Biodiversity effects were influenced by both trait differences between plants and community-weighted means, but these relationships were mostly independent of selection history. Our findings suggest that twelve years of selection history in monocultures or species mixtures differentiated plants of each species into monoculture-and mixture-types. Such rapid evolution of different community-types within grassland species and its effect on ecosystem services and functioning are likely to be important for species conservation practice.","[van Moorsel, Sofia J.; Schmid, Marc W.; Hahl, Terhi; Zuppinger-Dingley, Debra; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [van Moorsel, Sofia J.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Stewart Biol Bldg,1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",University of Zurich; McGill University,"van Moorsel, SJ; Schmid, B (autor correspondente), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.;van Moorsel, SJ (autor correspondente), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Stewart Biol Bldg,1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",sofia.vanmoorsel@ieu.uzh.ch; contact@mwschmid.ch; terhi.hahl@uzh.ch; debra.zuppinger@ieu.uzh.ch; bernhard.schmid@uzh.ch,"Zuppinger-Dingley, Debra/N-7022-2013; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; van Moorsel, Sofia Julia/ABD-2745-2020","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; van Moorsel, Sofia Julia/0000-0003-1947-8971; Schmid, Marc W/0000-0001-9554-5318; Zuppinger-Dingley, Debra/0000-0002-4573-0563","Swiss National Science Foundation [147092, 166457]; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich; German Science Foundation [FOR 1451, SCHM 1628/5-2]",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich; German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to T.

Support, however, comes mostly from experimental studies conducted at small spatial scales in low-diversity systems. Here, we test whether different species contribute to different ecosystem functions that are important for carbon cycling in a high-diversity human-modified tropical forest landscape in Southern Mexico. We quantified aboveground standing biomass, primary productivity, litter production, and wood decomposition at the landscape level, and evaluated the extent to which tree species contribute to these ecosystem functions. We used simulations to tease apart the effects of species richness, species dominance and species functional traits on ecosystem functions. We found that dominance was more important than species traits in determining a species' contribution to ecosystem functions. As a consequence of the high dominance in human-modified landscapes, the same small subset of species mattered across different functions. In human-modified landscapes in the tropics, biodiversity may play a limited role for ecosystem multifunctionality due to the potentially large effect of species dominance on biogeochemical functions. However, given the spatial and temporal turnover in species dominance, biodiversity may be critically important for the maintenance and resilience of ecosystem functions.","[Lohbeck, Madelon; Bongers, Frans; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico; [Lohbeck, Madelon] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.;Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.;Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, United Nations Ave,POB 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.",madelon.lohbeck@wur.com,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875","SEP-CONACYT [2009-129740]; NSF [DEB 1147429, DEB 0639393]; NSF-LTREB; research program ALW [863.15.017]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Wageningen University and Research; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development) [W85-326]; MABOTRO [SEMARNAT-CONACYT 2002-C01-0597, SEP-CONACYT CB-2005-01-51043, PAPIIT-DGAPA IN213714]; DiverSus project [IAI CRN 2015, SGP-CRA2015]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [283093]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1147429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",SEP-CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF-LTREB(National Science Foundation (NSF)); research program ALW; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Wageningen University and Research; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development); MABOTRO; DiverSus project; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"The authors thank Gilberto Jampangape for assistance during fieldwork and the community of Loma Bonita for assistance and hospitality.

While most studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have examined randomized species losses, trait-based filtering associated with species-specific vulnerability to drivers of diversity loss can strongly influence how ecosystem functioning responds to declining biodiversity. Moreover, the responses of ecosystem functioning to diversity loss may be mediated by environmental variability interacting with the suite of traits remaining in depauperate communities. We do not yet understand how communities resulting from realistic diversity losses (filtered by response traits) influence ecosystem functioning (via effect traits of the remaining community), especially under variable environmental conditions. Here, we directly test how realistic and randomized plant diversity losses influence productivity and invasion resistance across multiple years in a California grassland. Compared with communities based on randomized diversity losses, communities resulting from realistic (drought-driven) species losses had higher invasion resistance under climatic conditions that matched the trait-based filtering they experienced. However, productivity declined more with realistic than with randomized species losses across all years, regardless of climatic conditions. Functional response traits aligned with effect traits for productivity but not for invasion resistance. Our findings illustrate that the effects of biodiversity losses depend not only on the identities of lost species but also on how the traits of remaining species interact with varying environmental conditions. Understanding the consequences of biodiversity change requires studies that evaluate trait-mediated effects of species losses and incorporate the increasingly variable climatic conditions that future communities are expected to experience.","[Wolf, Amelia A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Funk, Jennifer L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Selmants, Paul C.] US Geol Survey, Western Geog Sci Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Morozumi, Connor N.] Emory Univ, Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut Program, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Hernandez, Daniel L.] Carleton Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Pasari, Jae R.] Portland State Univ, Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Zavaleta, Erika S.] Univ Calif Santa, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Emory University; Carleton College; Portland State University,"Wolf, AA (autor correspondente), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78705 USA.",amywolf@utexas.edu,"Funk, Jennifer/AAX-9325-2021","Wolf, Amelia/0000-0001-7660-3455; Morozumi, Connor/0000-0003-0235-3857; Selmants, Paul/0000-0001-6211-3957",NSF [DEB0918785],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was funded by the NSF Grant DEB0918785.

Two main hypotheses have emerged that address B-EF relationships: niche complementarity (NC) and the mass-ratio (MR) effect. We tested the relative importance of these hypotheses in a subtropical old-growth forest on the island nation of Taiwan for two EFs: aboveground biomass (ABG) and coarse woody productivity (CWP). Functional dispersion (FDis) of eight plant functional traits was used to evaluate complementarity of resource use. Under the NC hypothesis, EF will be positively correlated with FDis. Under the MR hypothesis, EF will be negatively correlated with FDis and will be significantly influenced by community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values. We used path analysis to assess how these two processes (NC and MR) directly influence EF and may contribute indirectly to EF via their influence on canopy packing (stem density). Our results indicate that decreasing functional diversity and a significant influence of CWM traits were linked to increasing AGB for all eight traits in this forest supporting the MR hypothesis. Interestingly, CWP was primarily influenced by NC and MR indirectly via their influence on canopy packing. Maximum height explained more of the variation in both AGB and CWP than any of the other plant functional traits. Together, our results suggest that multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence EF, and understanding their relative importance will help to elucidate the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem function.","[Chiang, Jyh-Min; Lin, Yiching] Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Spasojevic, Marko J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Panama City, Panama; [Sun, I-Fang] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien 97401, Taiwan; [Su, Sheng-Hsin] Taiwan Forestry Res Inst, Taipei 10066, Taiwan; [Chen, Zueng-Sang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Chem, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Teh] Natl Chung Hsin Univ, Dept Agron, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Swenson, Nathan G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [McEwan, Ryan W.] Univ Dayton, Dept Biol, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",Tunghai University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; National Dong Hwa University; National Taiwan University; National Chung Hsing University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Dayton,"Chiang, JM (autor correspondente), Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.",jyhmin@thu.edu.tw,"Chen, Chien-Teh/AAW-6030-2021; Su, Sheng-Hsin/AAC-3596-2021; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020","Chen, Chien-Teh/0000-0001-8721-165X; Su, Sheng-Hsin/0000-0003-1337-3335; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Muller-Landau, Helene C./0000-0002-3526-9021; Chiang, Jyh-Min/0000-0002-6293-1551","National Science Council of Taiwan [102-2313-B-029-003-MY3, 98-2313-B-029-001-MY3]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-1046113]; Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program; Council of Agriculture; National Science Council of Taiwan; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1354741] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program; Council of Agriculture; National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Council of Taiwan (102-2313-B-029-003-MY3, 98-2313-B-029-001-MY3 to J-MC), the US National Science Foundation (DEB-1046113), and the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science Research Grants Program (to RWM).

The large number of disparate metrics used to quantify functional diversity reflects the range of attributes underlying this concept, generally summarized as functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence. However, in practice, we know very little about which attributes drive which ecosystem functions, due to a lack of field-based tests. Here we test the association between eight leading functional diversity metrics (Rao's Q, FD, FDis, FEve, FDiv, convex hull volume, and species and functional group richness) that emphasize different attributes of functional diversity, plus 11 extensions of these existing metrics that incorporate heterogeneous species abundances and trait variation. We assess the relationships among these metrics and compare their performances for predicting three key ecosystem functions (above-and belowground biomass and light capture) within a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Many metrics were highly correlated, although unique information was captured in FEve, FDiv, and dendrogram-based measures (FD) that were adjusted by abundance. FD adjusted by abundance outperformed all other metrics in predicting both above-and belowground biomass, although several others also performed well (e. g. Rao's Q, FDis, FDiv). More generally, trait-based richness metrics and hybrid metrics incorporating multiple diversity attributes outperformed evenness metrics and single-attribute metrics, results that were not changed when combinations of metrics were explored. For light capture, species richness alone was the best predictor, suggesting that traits for canopy architecture would be necessary to improve predictions. Our study provides a comprehensive test linking different attributes of functional diversity with ecosystem function for a grassland system.","[Clark, Christopher M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Clark, Christopher M.] Arizona State Univ, Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA; [Flynn, Dan F.

In field experiment, we created some diversity-level assemblages by removing functional groups across two grassland ecosystems and evaluated the responses of spatial stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to varying functional trait diversity. The results revealed that higher diversity promoted greater spatial stability in the semi-shrub grassland ecosystem except SGB, whereas the similar pattern in diversity-stability relationship had been scarcely found in the typical steppe ecosystem. Additionally, we found that factors-influencing spatial stability varied across different grassland types. In the typical steppe ecosystem, spatial stability was only accounted for by positive sampling effect induced by high dispersal rate of rhizomatous grass. By contrast, in the semi-shrub grassland ecosystem, diversity level together with positive sampling effect commonly contributed to spatial stability, moreover, effect of particular trait overshadowed that of diversity. We also found that the positive diversity-stability relationship did not exist when compared with two grassland types. Research provides new insights into understanding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in varying environments. This relationship is not consistent across different ecosystems and is often system-dependent. Critical trait of species is particularly an important determinant for ecosystem functioning.","[Zhao Na; Lv Jinying; Wang Kun] China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang Zhengwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS","Wang, K (autor correspondente), China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",wangkun@cau.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011",,,,,NA,35,5,5,1,37,ACADEMIC JOURNALS,VICTORIA ISLAND,"P O BOX 5170-00200 NAIROBI, VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS 73023, NIGERIA",1684-5315,,,AFR J BIOTECHNOL,Afr.

However, predicting biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships based on community assembly remains challenging because assembly outcomes are often contingent on history and the consequences of history for ecosystem functions are poorly understood. In a grassland restoration experiment, we isolated the role of history for the relationships between plant biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions by initiating assembly in three different years, while controlling for all other aspects of community assembly. We found that two aspects of assembly history-establishment year and succession-altered species and trait community trajectories, which in turn altered net primary productivity, decomposition rates, and floral resources. Moreover, history altered BEF relationships (which ranged from positive to negative), both within and across functions, by modifying the causal pathways linking species identity, traits, diversity, and ecosystem functions. Our results show that the interplay of deterministic succession and environmental stochasticity during establishment mediate historical contingencies that cause variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions, even under otherwise identical assembly conditions. An explicit attention to history is needed to understand why biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships vary in natural ecosystems: a critical question at the intersection of fundamental theory and applications to environmental change biology and ecosystem restoration.","[Catano, Christopher P.; Groves, Anna M.; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Catano, Christopher P.; Groves, Anna M.; Brudvig, Lars A.] Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolut & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Catano, CP (autor correspondente), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Catano, CP (autor correspondente), Michigan State Univ, Program Ecol Evolut & Behav, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",chcatano@gmail.com,,"Catano, Christopher/0000-0002-4060-7291; Brudvig, Lars/0000-0002-3857-2165","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1552197, GRFP DGE-1424871]",U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: DEB-1552197, GRFP DGE-1424871",NA,41,0,0,25,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2023,104,2,,,,NA,,,,10.1002/ecy.3910,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3910,NA,DEC 2022,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8C2WJ,36315030,hybrid,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000901938900001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we hypothesized that leaf anatomical traits were closely related to gross primary productivity (GPP) because photosynthesis commonly occurs in the chloroplasts of palisade and spongy tissues in leaf. Eight leaf anatomical traits were measured in 916 plant species inhabiting from tropical to cold-temperate forests in eastern China: adaxial epidermis thickness (AD), abaxial epidermis thickness (AB), leaf thickness (LT), palisade tissue thickness (PT), and spongy tissue thickness (ST), palisade-spongy tissue ratio (PT/ST), palisade tissue-leaf thickness ratio (PT/LT), and spongy tissue-leaf thickness ratio (ST/LT). Leaf anatomical traits showed significant latitudinal patterns at species, plant functional group (PFG), and community levels (p<.05), and they differed between PFG and community. Temperature and precipitation were the main factors influencing AD, AB, PT/ST, and PT/LT, explaining 33-72% of the total variation at large scale. Furthermore, AB, LT, PT/ST, and PT/LT were significantly correlated with the aridity index.

Nutrient enrichment frequently increases plant productivity and decreases diversity while herbivores tend to maintain plant diversity in productive systems. However, the mechanisms by which nutrient enrichment and herbivores regulate plant diversity remain unclear. Abundance-based mechanisms propose that fertilization leads to the extinction of rare species due to random loss of individuals of all species. In contrast, functional-based mechanisms propose that species exclusion is based on functional traits which are disadvantageous under fertilized conditions. We tested mechanistic links between fertilization and diversity loss in the presence or absence of consumers using data from a 4-year fertilization and fencing experiment in an alpine meadow. We found that both abundance- and functional-based mechanisms simultaneously affected species loss in the absence of herbivores while only abundance-based mechanisms affected species loss in the presence of herbivores. Our results indicate that an abundance-based mechanism may consistently play a role in the loss of plant diversity with fertilization, and that diversity decline is driven primarily by the loss of rare species regardless of a plant's functional traits and whether or not herbivores are present. Increasing efforts to conserve rare species in the context of ecosystem eutrophication is a central challenge for grazed grassland ecosystems.","[Yang, Zhongling; Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhongling] Henan Univ, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Key Lab Plant Stress Biol, Coll Life Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England; [Hautier, Yann; Borer, Elizabeth T.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Ecol & Biodivers, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Zhang, Chunhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Henan University; University of Oxford; Utrecht University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Du, GZ (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",yang_zhl06@126.com; guozdu@lzu.edu.cn,"Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Zhang, Chunhui/G-4663-2016; Hautier, Yann/D-5426-2015","Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Zhang, Chunhui/0000-0002-1500-4114; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41430749, 31300363]; Postdoctoral Foundation of China [2013M541970, 2014T70675]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postdoctoral Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"Special thanks to T.

However, most of the studies have been conducted in controlled experiments in grasslands, few observational, field studies have been carried out in forests. In this paper, we report variations of species diversity, functional diversity and aboveground biomass (AGB) for woody plants (trees and shrubs) along a chronosequence of four successional stages (18-year-old fallow, 30-year-old fallow, 60-year-old fallow, and old-growth forest) in a tropical lowland rainforest recovered after shifting cultivation on Hainan Island, China. Fifty randomly selected sample plots of 20 m x 20 m were investigated in each of the four successional stages. Four functional traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum species height and leaf dry matter content) were measured for each woody plants species and the relationships between species/functional diversity and AGB during secondary succession were explored. The results showed that both plant diversity and AGB recovered gradually with the secondary succession. AGB was positively correlated with both species and functional diversity in each stage of succession. Consistent with many controlled experimental results in grasslands, our observational field study confirms that ecosystem functioning is closely related to biodiversity during secondary succession in species rich tropical forests.

The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that are measured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. A variety of linear and nonlinear methods were used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in the most comprehensive data set. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits.Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs whenever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining community assembly across different ecosystems.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Dept Biol Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato; University of Waikato,"Laughlin, DC (autor correspondente), Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",d.laughlin@waikato.ac.nz,,,Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund [UOW1201],Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),"I thank Chris Lusk, Mike Clearwater, the students and staff in the Plant Biology and Ecology Lab at the University of Waikato, and two anonymous referees for providing helpful comments and suggestions.

Here, we examined the responses of plant species dominant under ambient nutrient conditions (baseline species) versus those that become dominant under increased nutrient conditions (enriched species) in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The expression of 8 functional traits was quantified for 3 baseline and 3 enriched species within one short-term and one long-term nutrient addition experiment. We found that enriched species occupied a trait space characterized by traits that generally correspond with faster growth rates than baseline species. Additionally, the enriched species shifted in their trait expression relative to the control more than the baseline species with nutrient additions, particularly within the long-term experiment. The trait space shifts of individual species with nutrient additions scaled up to affect community aggregate trait values within both experiments. However, traits that responded to nutrient additions at the community level were not strong predictors of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) within the short-term experiment. In contrast, in the long-term experiment, one response trait (community aggregate height) strongly correlated with variation in ANPP with nutrient additions. The link between plant functional traits and community and ecosystem responses to chronic nutrient additions shown here will provide important insight into key mechanisms driving grassland responses to global change.","[La Pierre, Kimberly J.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA",Yale University; Colorado State University,"La Pierre, KJ (autor correspondente), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",kimberly.lapierre@berkeley.edu,"Smith, Melinda D/J-8987-2014","Komatsu, Kimberly/0000-0001-7056-4547",Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Center for Field Ecology Pilot Grant; Lee Pierce Fund; Konza LTER; NSF [(NSF-DEB-1042132]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1042132] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Center for Field Ecology Pilot Grant; Lee Pierce Fund; Konza LTER; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"The authors are grateful for field and lab help from M.

In this context, regenerative seed traits play an important, yet overlooked, role because they largely determine the ability of plants to disperse and re-establish. A survey of recent publications in community ecology suggests that seed germination traits in particular are neglected at the expense of other relevant but overused traits based only on seed morphology. As a response to this bias, we discuss the functional significance of seed germination traits in comparison with morphological and biophysical seed traits, and advocate their use in vegetation science. We also demonstrate how research in community assembly, climate change and restoration ecology can benefit from the inclusion of germination traits, encompassing functions that cannot be explained solely by adult plant traits. Seed germination experiments conducted in the laboratory or field to quantify these traits provide ecologically meaningful and relatively easy-to-obtain information about the functional properties of plant communities. We argue that bridging the gap between seed physiologists and community ecologists will improve the prediction of plant assemblages, and propose further perspectives for including seed traits into the research agenda of functional community ecologists.","[Jimenez-Alfaro, Borja] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Silveira, Fernando A.

Exploring the mechanisms underlying the change in ecosystem productivity under anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs is of fundamental ecological interest. It has been proposed that functional traits, environmental factors and species richness are central drivers linking ecosystem productivity with environmental change. However, few studies have considered the joint effects of functional traits, environmental factors and species richness on ecosystem productivity under increasing N inputs. 2. We established a N-manipulation experiment in a Tibetan alpine steppe in 2013. Using structural equation models, we assessed the effects of N-induced changes in environmental factors, species richness and trait metrics (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of trait distribution) on gross ecosystem productivity as well as three resource use efficiencies (water, light and phosphorus (P) use efficiencies), based on measurements during the peak growing season in 2016. 3. We found that both light and P use efficiencies decreased under N enrichment, largely due to the N-induced decline in functional diversity of leaf P concentration. However, both gross ecosystem productivity and water use efficiency exhibited initial increases and subsequent slight decreases with N addition. These nonlinear patterns were closely associated with both the increased morphological trait (i.e. mean of leaf area) and decreased diversity of leaf P concentration. 4. Synthesis. Our results illustrate how N-induced changes in functional traits may have dual effects on ecosystem productivity: the stimulating effects of the dominant trait identity via increasing canopy light interception versus the inhibiting effect of decreasing trait diversity via declining resource use efficiencies. Our results highlight the importance of including functional traits in land surface models to improve predictions of the response of ecosystem function to N inputs.","[Zhan, Dianye; Peng, Yunfeng; Li, Fei; Yang, Guibiao; Wang, Jun; Yu, Jianchun; Yang, Yuanhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Dianye; Li, Fei; Yang, Guibiao; Wang, Jun; Yu, Jianchun; Yang, Yuanhe] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guoying] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Yang, YH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yang, YH (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yhyang@ibcas.ac.cn,"Yang, Yuanhe/D-1448-2011; Zhou, Guoying/AAE-5590-2020; Yu, Jian/HJY-2670-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31825006, 91837312, 31770521]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-SMC049]; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Cooperation Team","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Cooperation Team","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31825006, 91837312, 31770521; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: QYZDB-SSW-SMC049; Chinese Academy of Sciences-Peking University Pioneer Cooperation Team",NA,63,29,35,21,188,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Animal (secondary) productivity is not dependent on plant functional diversity, but the variability in productivity of grasslands is related to the functional diversity of leaf dry matter content.

However, how soil moisture condition, plant species richness interactively affect ecosystem functions in shrub-encroached grasslands is poorly understood. We conducted a soil moisture x species richness microcosm experiment using semi-arid grassland species with a N-fixing shrub Caragana microphylla Lam. as the dominant species to evaluate how soil moisture and plant species richness affected ecosystem functions directly or indirectly via regulating community functional structure, such as community weighted mean values (CWM) and functional dispersion (FDis). Soil moisture and species richness interactively affected soil functions (soil C-, N-, P cycles and soil multifunctionality), with greater species richness buffering the adverse effects of soil drought. Soil moisture and species richness showed opposite effects on FDis but similar effects on CWM. FDis mediated the indirect effect of soil moisture and species richness on ecosystem functions, while CWM only mediated the indirect effect of soil moisture. More specifically, both soil moisture and plant species richness were negatively associated with soil P cycle, and the CWMPC1 contributed by traits related to resource-conservative strategy was positively associated with soil N cycle. Species richness showed a positive direct effect on total shoot biomass, which was mainly contributed by the complementarity effect of neighbor species richness. This study provides strong empirical support of how biomass and soil nutrient cycles respond to the changes of soil moisture and plant species richness in C. microphylla shrub-encroached grasslands, and insights on the mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of soil condition and community species composition on multiple ecosystem functions in N-fixing shrub encroached grasslands in semi-arid grassland regions.

Grassland provides ecosystem goods and services, mainly through the provisioning of milk and meat. Therefore, the proper use of grasslands will be essential for feeding the nine billion people that will inhabit planet Earth by 2050. In the context of a changing climate, we should better understand the interactions of environment, management and grass crop at individual, community and ecosystem levels. Functional ecology focuses on the roles and functions that species play in the community or ecosystem in which they occur. Functional ecology thus aims to understand how plant species adapt to environmental conditions and how management can alter this adaptation. Here, we review the latest advances in plant functional traits research and on species strategies to the main environmental factors occurring in grassland ecosystems: nutrient availability, grazing, cutting and shading. Functional ecology also provides a framework to better understand how species strategies interact with the species composition at the community level. Therefore, the literature on community assembling theories in relation to ecosystem processes most relevant to grassland management and services is also reviewed. Finally, future research questions and some new orientations for grassland experts are offered in order to meet the challenge of maintaining productivity and preservation of these semi-natural environments in the face of global change.","[Pontes, Laise da Silveira] Agron Inst Parana, IAPAR, BR-84001970 Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil; [Maire, Vincent] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Grp Rech Biol Vegetale, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Maire, Vincent] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; [Schellberg, Juergen] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Crop Sci Grp, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Louault, Frederique] INRA, Ecosyst Prairial UREP UR0874, F-63039 Clermont Ferrand, France",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; University of Bonn; INRAE,"Pontes, LD (autor correspondente), Agron Inst Parana, IAPAR, CP 129, BR-84001970 Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil.",laisepontes@iapar.br,"Pontes, Laíse/GSN-8975-2022; Pontes, Laíse/B-8234-2016","Pontes, Laíse/0000-0002-3906-3047; Maire, Vincent/0000-0002-3245-2568; LOUAULT, Frederique/0000-0002-9430-4261",German Research Foundation (DFG) [SCHE 549/2-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to Jean-Francois Soussana and Pascal Carrere, as well as all INRA-UREP team for the support on traits' experiment at Clermont-Ferrand.

Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Petchey, OL (autor correspondente), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",o.petchey@shef.ac.uk,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; TATSUTA, HARUKI/F-2997-2010","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; ",,,,NA,125,1511,1601,56,1190,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Biodiversity is being lost in our rapidly changing world. Most studies that examine biodiversity measure species richness, but loss of functional diversity (FD) - defined as the trait variation or dispersion in an assemblage - is equally important. FD is useful for management actions focused on ecosystem services or functions, especially when ecosystem function is ambiguously defined, or there are multiple functions of interest. Because FD is often a multivariate measure of species differences, it has additional relevance given that we seldom have a complete understanding of how traits translate to function. 2. This Special Profile includes six papers that examine how management activities or policy could benefit from consideration of the functional contributions of species. When focused on species richness, management activities may unintentionally reduce FD, with detrimental consequences for ecosystem services or stability. For example, two of the studies included in this Special Profile show that grassland management (e.g. mowing or grazing) can result in loss of FD, which may result in an unintended loss of ecosystem services. 3. A third paper reviews how species extinction and environmental change can negatively affect FD and, potentially, ecosystem function. At the individual species level, invasions offer insight into the importance of species traits. The fourth paper in this Special Profile describes how an invader is successful because of unique trait values, underlining the importance of examining FD when considering management options. In another paper, eutrophication is shown to drastically affect lichen functional groups (some decreasing and some increasing) with a minor effect on overall richness. The final paper demonstrates that the ability of aquatic plants to maintain biomass production in changing environments is determined by their complementary contributions to productivity. These complementary contributions to ecosystem function - especially given that they are more important in fluctuating environments - need to be included in evaluations of diversity. 4. Synthesis and applications. As FD is increasingly assessed in applied studies, it will call into question how we measure diversity and evaluate management success. It is clear that species richness cannot be the only measure considered. Given that environmental change and management activities can reduce FD as well as the number of species, management goals and criteria for success need to include FD.","[Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON M1C 1J3, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto,"Cadotte, MW (autor correspondente), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON M1C 1J3, Canada.",mcadotte@utsc.utoronto.ca,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693",,,,NA,28,55,57,1,122,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Loss of plant biodiversity triggered by anthropogenic and climatic factors jeopardizes environmental stability and sustainable forage production. The understanding of biodiversity mechanisms and functional traits of species can help to design forage production systems to buffer against perturbations. Resilience and productivity are linked to plant species characteristics and interactions that enable them to recover from adverse conditions and compensate for the loss of susceptible species. Benefits of diversified crops including enhanced carbon assimilation, nitrogen fixation, and turnover are transferred to soil microbes which in return contribute to resilience against drought and poor soil fertility. In the absence of disturbances, these mechanisms are credited for stability and climax ecosystems. Cultivated systems are more fragile because management interferes with many functions while maintaining few. Strategies that sustain an entire range of functions can increase production regardless of climatic and management factors. This has been demonstrated in binary mixtures of cool season grasses including meadow bromegrass (Bromus biebersteinii Roem. & Schult.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), and intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R.

Therefore, mixing crop varieties is a promising alternative practice to transform modern high-input agriculture that is associated with a drastic reduction of within-field crop genetic diversity and is widely recognized as unsustainable. Here, we review the effects of mixtures of varieties on ecosystem functioning, and their underlying ecological mechanisms, as studied in ecology and agronomy, and outline how this knowledge can help designing more efficient mixtures. We recommend the development of two complementary strategies to optimize variety mixtures by fostering the ecological mechanisms leading to a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and its stability through time, i.e., sampling and complementarity effects. (1) In the trait-blind approach, the design of high-performance mixtures is based on estimations of the mixing abilities of varieties. While this approach is operational because it does not require detailed trait knowledge, it relies on heavy experimental designs to evaluate mixing ability. (2) The trait-based approach is particularly efficient to design mixtures of varieties to provide particular baskets of services but requires building databases of traits for crop varieties and documenting the relations between traits and services. The performance of mixtures requires eventually to be evaluated in real economic, social, and agronomic contexts. We conclude that the need of a multifunctional low-input agriculture strongly increases the attractiveness of mixtures but that new breeding approaches are required to create varieties with higher mixing abilities, to foster complementarity and selection effects through an increase in the variance of relevant traits and to explore new combinations of trait values.","[Barot, Sebastien; Lata, Jean-Christophe; Niboyet, Audrey] UPEC, CNRS, IRD, IEES P, 7 Quai St Bernard,Bat A,7e Etage,CC 237, F-75005 Paris, France; [Allard, Vincent] INRA, UMR Genet Diversite & Ecophysiol Cereales 1095, 234 Ave Brezet, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Cantarel, Amelie; Le Roux, Xavier] Univ Lyon 1, UMR CNRS 5557, UMR INRA 1418, Ecol Microbienne, Villeurbanne, France; [Enjalbert, Jerome; Goldringer, Isabelle] UPS, CNRS, INRA, UMR 0320,Genet Vegetale, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gauffreteau, Arnaud] Univ Paris Saclay, INRA, UMR Agron 211, AgroParisTech, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Lata, Jean-Christophe] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Dept Geoecol & Geochem, Lenin Ave 30, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Porcher, Emanuelle] Sorbonne Univ, MNHN CNRS UPMC, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Ctr Ecol & Sci Conservat,UMR 7204, CP135,43 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); INRAE; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); VetAgro Sup; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite,"Barot, S (autor correspondente), UPEC, CNRS, IRD, IEES P, 7 Quai St Bernard,Bat A,7e Etage,CC 237, F-75005 Paris, France.",sebastien.barot@ird.fr,"barot, sébastien/A-8447-2012; Allard, Vincent/B-8806-2009","barot, sébastien/0000-0002-5910-538X; Allard, Vincent/0000-0003-1949-9158; Amelie, Cantarel/0000-0002-7445-3403; LE ROUX, Xavier/0000-0001-9695-0825; Porcher, Emmanuelle/0000-0002-9264-8239",ANR through the project Wheatamix; INRA meta-programme EcoServ through the project SolFaMi,ANR through the project Wheatamix(French National Research Agency (ANR)); INRA meta-programme EcoServ through the project SolFaMi,The authors acknowledge support from the ANR through the project Wheatamix and from the INRA meta-programme EcoServ through the project SolFaMi.

Agricultural production, or the growing of plants under controlled conditions to produce desired resources, can be a helpful tool for providing the quantities of seeds needed for large-scale restoration. In some ecosystems, agricultural production of native plant seeds is part of the restoration process. This is particularly true for native plants that are similar to major food crops, such as native grasses. However, conventional crops have contrasting characteristics (e.g. fast growing, high yield for a focused use) from those desired in restored vegetation (plants capable of surviving and providing ecosystem services in variable environments). This contrast leads to significant, often opposing differences in desirable characteristics in crop versus natural systems. Examples include rapid germination in domesticated crops versus seed dormancy in wild plants, uniform germination, growth and flowering versus bet-hedging strategies, or high seed retention versus seed dispersal. While it may be useful to maximize productivity of native plants in agricultural environments with similar trait modifications, for restoration, the demands of the natural environment should be primary, and agricultural production should aim to maximize the diversity, function, and evolutionary potential of native species. Any perceived benefits that come from the production of large quantities of inexpensive seeds that cannot meet the needs of wild communities are short-sighted. We suggest research directions that will be needed to meld agricultural production needs with those of restoration practitioners, as a challenge for those invested in the procurement and use of wild seeds.","[Leger, Elizabeth A.; Agneray, Alison C.] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, 1664 N Virginia St,Mail Stop 0314, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Baughman, Owen W.] Eastern Oregon Agr Res Ctr, Nat Conservancy, 67826-A Highway 205, Burns, OR 97720 USA; [Brummer, E.

Phylogenetic diversity (PD) represents a potentially valuable measure of restoration success because it can correlate with functional trait diversity that drives ecosystem function. However, PD patterns in restored communities are rarely assessed. We surveyed plant communities in restored tallgrass prairies 2-19years old and calculated two PD measures, SESMNTD and SESMPD, of the communities and seed mixture applied to sites. We also identified high-threat exotic species present in each site to determine whether PD of the seed mixture applied was related to resistance against invasion. We show that PD in North American tallgrass prairie restorations, as measured by both SESMNTD and SESMPD, is maintained over time even as richness declines. Neither the resulting community PD nor invasion by high-threat exotic species was affected by PD of the seed mixture used in site restoration. Thus, simply maximizing PD of seed mixtures without considering the particular component species is unlikely to help achieve restoration goals.Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that species losses over time are not biased towards species with or without close relatives in the community. If phylogenetic diversity (PD) reflects functional trait diversity in communities, then local declines in species richness may not necessarily mean the loss of ecosystem function in restoration projects. However, PD of restored communities may be limited by low establishment rates for most species. Conservation practitioners should consider PD with careful planning to maintain overall community diversity and potentially maximize ecosystem function and services in restorations. This perspective will require a deeper understanding of the relationships between phylogenetic relatedness and traits associated with competition and fitness.","[Barber, Nicholas A.; Jones, Holly P.; Duvall, Melvin R.; Wysocki, William P.] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Barber, Nicholas A.; Jones, Holly P.] Northern Illinois Univ, Inst Study Environm Sustainabil & Energy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Hansen, Michael J.] Univ Wisconsin Arboretum, Madison, WI 53711 USA; [Gibson, David J.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Gibson, David J.] Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",Northern Illinois University; Northern Illinois University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Barber, NA (autor correspondente), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.;Barber, NA (autor correspondente), Northern Illinois Univ, Inst Study Environm Sustainabil & Energy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",nbarber@niu.edu,,"Jones, Holly/0000-0002-5512-9958",Nature Conservancy; Northern Illinois University; Southern Illinois University Carbondale,Nature Conservancy; Northern Illinois University; Southern Illinois University Carbondale,"We are grateful to W.

Despite a growing awareness of the importance of belowground traits for ecological processes, a synthesis of how root traits can inform restoration of terrestrial plant communities is lacking. We reviewed and summarized existing literature focused on root traits in relation to plant performance measures (i.e. survival, establishment, productivity) in the contexts of drought and competition (including invasion). Root traits related to belowground resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length, deep roots) are frequently related to drought avoidance (i.e. a plant strategy based on optimizing water uptake to maintain function), whereas studies relating root traits to drought tolerance (i.e. a plant strategy that allows plants to withstand low hydration) remain limited. More studies have linked root traits to plant competitive effects (i.e. the influence a plant has on neighbors) than to competitive responses (i.e. a plant's ability to resist the effects of neighbors). Because plants with acquisitive traits decrease resources to the detriment of neighbors, root traits associated with rapid resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length) may be important for understanding competitive effects. Albeit more limited, research suggests root traits associated with resource conservation or stress tolerance (e.g. high root tissue density, high root diameter) may elucidate mechanisms related to competitive responses. Re-vegetation outcomes may be improved by considering root traits, but only if clear links are made between traits and plant performance in varied contexts.","[Garbowski, Magda; Avera, Bethany; Bertram, Jonathan H.; Courkamp, Jacob S.; Gray, Jesse; Hein, Kirsten M.; Lawrence, Ryan; McClelland, Shelby; Post, Alison K.; Slette, Ingrid J.; Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Garbowski, Magda; Bertram, Jonathan H.; Hein, Kirsten M.; Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Avera, Bethany; McClelland, Shelby] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Courkamp, Jacob S.; Lawrence, Ryan] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gray, Jesse; Post, Alison K.; Slette, Ingrid J.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [McIntosh, Mariah] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Winkler, Daniel E.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; University of Montana System; University of Montana; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Garbowski, M (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Garbowski, M (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",magda.garbowski@colostate.edu,"Slette, Ingrid J/AAL-8634-2020; Garbowski, Magda/AAM-6637-2021; Winkler, Daniel E./C-5710-2019","Slette, Ingrid J/0000-0002-7707-3246; Garbowski, Magda/0000-0002-5427-7916; Winkler, Daniel E./0000-0003-4825-9073; McIntosh, Mariah/0000-0002-3921-1441; Courkamp, Jacob/0000-0003-3225-2774",USDA NIFA AFRI Predoctoral Fellowship [2018-07872],USDA NIFA AFRI Predoctoral Fellowship,"This research was supported by USDA NIFA AFRI Predoctoral Fellowship to MG (2018-07872).

Recent investigations suggest that the functional structure of communities, i.e. the composition and diversity of functional traits, is the main driver of ecological processes. However, the predictive power of BEF research is still low, the integration of all components of functional community structure as predictors is still lacking, and the multifunctionality of ecosystems (i.e. rates of multiple processes) must be considered. Here, using a multiple-processes framework from grassland biodiversity experiments, we show that functional identity of species and functional divergence among species, rather than species diversity per se, together promote the level of ecosystem multifunctionality with a predictive power of 80%. Our results suggest that primary productivity and decomposition rates, two key ecosystem processes upon which the global carbon cycle depends, are primarily sustained by specialist species, i.e. those that hold specialized combinations of traits and perform particular functions. Contrary to studies focusing on single ecosystem functions and considering species richness as the sole measure of biodiversity, we found a linear and non-saturating effect of the functional structure of communities on ecosystem multifunctionality. Thus, sustaining multiple ecological processes would require focusing on trait dominance and on the degree of community specialization, even in species-rich assemblages.","[Mouillot, David] Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Ecol Syst Marins Cotiers, UMR 5119, Montpellier, France; [Villeger, Sebastien] Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, UMR 5174, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Mason, Norman W.

Conservation measures are thus essential to safeguard the ecosystem services that biodiversity provides and human society needs. Current anthropogenic threats may lead to detrimental (and perhaps irreversible) ecosystem degradation, providing strong motivation to evaluate the response of ecological communities to various anthropogenic pressures. In particular, ecosystem functions that sustain key ecosystem services should be identified and prioritized for conservation action. Traditional diversity measures (e.g. species richness') may not adequately capture the aspects of biodiversity most relevant to ecosystem stability and functionality, but several new concepts may be more appropriate. These include response diversity', describing the variation of responses to environmental change among species of a particular community. Response diversity may also be a key determinant of ecosystem resilience in the face of anthropogenic pressures and environmental uncertainty. However, current understanding of response diversity is poor, and we see an urgent need to disentangle the conceptual strands that pervade studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Our review clarifies the links between response diversity and the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by focusing on the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity and the concept of functional redundancy. We provide a conceptual model to describe how loss of response diversity may cause ecosystem degradation through decreased ecosystem resilience. We explicitly explain how response diversity contributes to functional compensation and to spatio-temporal complementarity among species, leading to long-term maintenance of ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent quantitative studies suggest that traditional diversity measures may often be uncoupled from measures (such as response diversity) that may be more effective proxies for ecosystem stability and resilience. Certain conclusions and recommendations of earlier studies using these traditional measures as indicators of ecosystem resilience thus may be suspect. We believe that functional ecology perspectives incorporating the effects and responses of diversity are essential for development of management strategies to safeguard (and restore) optimal ecosystem functionality (especially multifunctionality). Our review highlights these issues and we envision our work generating debate around the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functionality, and leading to improved conservation priorities and biodiversity management practices that maximize ecosystem resilience in the face of uncertain environmental change.","[Mori, Akira S.; Furukawa, Takuya] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Sasaki, Takehiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan",Yokohama National University; University of Tokyo,"Mori, AS (autor correspondente), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",akkym@kb3.so-net.ne.jp,"Furukawa, Takuya/I-7835-2012; Sasaki, Takehiro/C-8896-2012; Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013; Furukawa, Takuya/AAK-8941-2020","Furukawa, Takuya/0000-0003-2006-6560; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152; Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198; Furukawa, Takuya/0000-0003-2006-6560",JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) Global COE Program for Yokohama National University [E03]; Kondo Grant of the Asahi Glass Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25712036] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) Global COE Program for Yokohama National University; Kondo Grant of the Asahi Glass Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by the JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) Global COE Program for Yokohama National University (E03) and by the Kondo Grant of the Asahi Glass Foundation.

Functional diversity is the range and distribution of functional trait values in a community. It can be described, among other indicators, by community-level weighted means of trait values (CWM) and functional divergence. Standard methods exist for trait measurements but not for assessments of CWM and functional divergence in the field. No research has addressed the effects of different methods of estimating relative abundances, nor the need to estimate traits at individual, population or species level, or whether methods could be used that bypass taxonomy all together. This study reviews and evaluates plot-level assessment methods of functional diversity in herbaceous vegetation. We asked: (i) Should the objective of the study influence the method for estimating relative abundance? (ii) What are the strengths and limitations of intensive vs. 'rapid' approaches, and when should either be applied? (iii) Are taxon-free methods robust in comparison to taxon-explicit methods of trait measurement? Under what circumstances might they be applied? Our review of published studies that have measured functional diversity in the field showed that the choice of metric has not generally taken into account the link between the metric and the functions of interest, and that vegetation cover has been most widely used, regardless of study purpose. We compared quantitatively in subalpine grasslands three methods for quantification of species abundances plus one taxon-free method. We found that: (i) data base trait values were robust across years for a diverse set of dominant species; (ii) CWM have little sensitivity to method for estimating relative abundances; this sensitivity also depends on traits, for example, seed mass results were less stable than leaf traits and heights; (iii) robust estimates of CWM were obtained from visual estimates of species ranks and biomass using a dry-weight ranking method (BOTANAL), whereas functional divergence was more sensitive to method; and (iv) the taxon-free method should be treated with more caution and performed particularly poorly for estimates of functional divergence. We conclude that methodology can affect estimates of functional diversity.

The costs, subsequent trade-offs, and effects on plant performance of mechanical traits are not well understood, but it appears that many of these traits have evolved in response to abiotic and biotic mechanical forces and resource deficits. The relationships between environmental stresses and mechanical traits can be specific and direct, as in responses to strong winds, with structural reinforcement related to plant survival. Some traits such as leaf toughness might provide protection from multiple forms of stress. In both cases, the adaptive value of mechanical traits may vary between habitats, so is best considered in the context of the broader growth environment, not just of the proximate stress. Plants can also show considerable phenotypic plasticity in mechanical traits, allowing adjustment to changing environments across a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is not always clear whether a mechanical property is adaptive or a consequence of the physiology associated with stress. Mechanical traits do not only affect plant survival; evidence suggests they have downstream effects on ecosystem organization and functioning (e.g., diversity, trophic relationships, and productivity), but these remain poorly explored.","Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, INRA, Lab Franco Chinois Informat Automat & Math Appl L, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China","Monash University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS","Read, J (autor correspondente), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",jenny.read@sci.monash.edu.au,,"stokes, alexia/0000-0002-2276-0911",,,,NA,252,213,224,6,242,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9122,1537-2197,,AM J BOT,Am.

A possible mechanism for this positive effect of biodiversity is that more diverse plant communities have a greater capacity to respond to environmental changes through shifts in species dominance and composition. In our study, we utilized data from five long-term grassland biodiversity experiments located in North America (three studies) and Central Europe (two studies), in which plant species richness and global change drivers were manipulated simultaneously. The global change drivers included warming, drought, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, elevated N inputs, or intensive management. Across drivers, functional change over time was significantly greater for communities of high plant diversity than that of low diversity because of a higher functional and phylogenetic richness and mostly associated with a dominance by species with a 'slow and tall' strategy. Community functional shifts in response to global change drivers were, however, relatively weak and mostly not influenced by diversity. The exception to this was warming, where diverse communities showed stronger shifts than species-poor communities. Our results confirm the hypothesis that diverse communities have a greater capacity for functional change than species-poor communities, particularly in their successional dynamics, but also potentially in their responses to environmental change. This capacity could underlie the positive biodiversity-stability relationship and buffer ecosystem responses to environmental change.","[Vogel, Anja; Roscher, Christiane; Weigelt, Alexandra; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Vogel, Anja; Weigelt, Alexandra; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Vogel, Anja] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Jena, Germany; [Manning, Peter] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, Frankfurt, Germany; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cowles, Jane; Isbell, Forest; Kimmel, Kaitlin; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Jousset, Alexandre L.

We report results of the analysis of 11 variables addressing several aspects of key ecosystem processes like biomass production, resource use (space, light, and nitrogen), and decomposition, measured across three years in plots of varying plant species richness at eight different European grassland field sites. Differences among sites explained substantial and significant amounts of the variation of most of the ecosystem processes examined. However, against this background of geographic variation, all the aspects of plant diversity and composition we examined (i.e., both numbers and types of species and functional groups) produced significant, mostly positive impacts on ecosystem processes. Analyses using the additive partitioning method revealed that complementarity effects (greater net yields than predicted from monocultures due to resource partitioning, positive interactions, etc.) were stronger and more consistent than selection effects (the covariance between monoculture yield and change in yield in mixtures) caused by dominance of species with particular traits. In general, communities with a higher diversity of species and functional groups were more productive and utilized resources more completely by intercepting more light, taking up more nitrogen, and occupying more of the available space. Diversity had significant effects through both increased vegetation cover and greater nitrogen retention by plants when this resource was more abundant through N-2 fixation by legumes. However, additional positive diversity effects remained even after controlling for differences in vegetation cover and for the presence of legumes in communities. Diversity effects were stronger on above- than belowground processes. In particular, clear diversity effects on decomposition were only observed at one of the eight sites. The ecosystem effects of plant diversity also varied between sites and years. In general, diversity effects were lowest in the first year and stronger later in the experiment, indicating that they were not transitional due to community establishment. These analyses of our complete ecosystem process data set largely reinforce our previous results, and those from comparable biodiversity experiments, and extend the generality of diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships to multiple sites, years, and processes.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, NERC, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ Zurich, Inst Environm Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Lehrstuhl Biogeog, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Tecn Lisboa, Dept Engn Florestal, PT-1399 Lisbon, Portugal; Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies, Biodivers Conservat Lab, GR-81100 Mitilini, Lesbos, Greece; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, Ireland; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr Res No Sweden, Crop Sci Sect, SE-90403 Umea, Sweden; Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; Ecole Normale Super, Ecol Lab, UMR 7625, F-75230 Paris 05, France; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Basel; Imperial College London; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); University of Zurich; Max Planck Society; University of Bayreuth; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Aegean; University College Cork; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Turku; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); University of Sheffield,"Spehn, EM (autor correspondente), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schoenbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",eva.spehn@unibas.ch,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; Woodward, Frank Ian/P-4530-2019; Leadley, Paul/E-4773-2012; Finn, John A/D-4635-2009; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-8797-2021; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Freitas, Helena/ABE-6998-2020; Read, David/C-2454-2013; Caldeira, Maria/D-4107-2013; Freitas, Helena/A-2803-2010; Woodward, Ian F/B-7762-2008; Spehn, Eva/B-7070-2018; Giller, Paul/AAB-1187-2021; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-9693-2021; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Högberg, Peter/B-2916-2012; Caldeira, Maria/HPD-8762-2023; Koricheva, Julia/G-6754-2011","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Finn, John A/0000-0003-3616-5563; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Caldeira, Maria/0000-0002-3586-8526; Freitas, Helena/0000-0002-1907-9615; Giller, Paul/0000-0002-0641-7152; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219; Högberg, Peter/0000-0002-2849-2719; Koricheva, Julia/0000-0002-9033-0171; Spehn, Eva M./0000-0002-5172-3415; Dimitrakopoulos, Panayiotis/0000-0002-8374-4392; Pereira, Joao/0000-0002-3658-5587; Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465",,,,NA,110,376,405,15,378,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

However, to date, principles of functional trait ecology have not been widely applied to agricultural research and management. Here, we discuss why and how a functional trait approach - distinct from a traditional agronomic trait approach that focuses strictly on crop yield components - can provide a valuable framework for agricultural research. We illustrate these points with an emphasis on commodity crops. The literature suggests a key role for functional trait-based research in understanding the causes and consequences of changes in agroecosystem structure and function. This includes novel approaches to understanding crop breeding and productivity, agroecosystem dynamics and non-crop biodiversity maintenance, the contributions of agroecosystems to global net primary productivity and other biogeochemical cycles, and agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We propose that a key step in advancing trait-based agricultural research is the consolidation of functional trait data for the world's most common crop and fodder species, the main commodities on approximate to 12 billion ha of land. Using Coffea arabica as an example, we show there is strong potential to populate a comprehensive data base of crop functional trait data. For C.arabica, there exist hundreds of observations for ecologically important leaf economics' and root economics' traits, either in smaller data bases or peer-reviewed studies, but these have not been consolidated. A similar opportunity for functional trait data consolidation exists for many of the world's most common crops.Synthesis and applications. A unified functional trait data base for just 65 of the world's most common agricultural crops can be used to provide baseline evaluations of the functional diversity across croplands covering approximate to 81% of the Earth's land surface. This functional trait data, and other trait-based research, could further be used to evaluate how changes in interspecific and intraspecific crop diversity are mechanistically linked with alterations in agroecosystem function. Ultimately, trait-based research that examines the causes and consequences of agricultural homogenization may contribute to more ecologically informed management of agricultural diversity, from genetic through to global scales.

The importance of PSFs for understanding ecosystem functioning has been the focus of much recent research, for example, in predicting the consequences for agricultural production, biodiversity conservation, and plant population dynamics. Here, we describe an experiment designed to test PSFs left by plants with contrasting traits under field conditions. This is one of the first, large-scale field experiments of its kind. We removed the existent plant community and replaced it with target plant communities that conditioned the soil. These communities consisted of contrasting proportions of grass and forb cover and consisted of either fast- or slow-growing plants, in accordance with the plant economics spectrum. We chose this well-established paradigm because plants on opposite ends of this spectrum have developed contrasting strategies to cope with environmental conditions. This means they differ in their feedbacks with soil abiotic and biotic factors. The experimental procedure was repeated in two successive years in two different subplots in order to investigate temporal effects on soils that were conditioned by the same plant community. Our treatments were successful in creating plant communities that differed in their total percentage cover based on temporal conditioning, percentage of grasses versus forbs, and percentage of fast- versus slow-growing plants. As a result, we expect that the influence of these different plant communities will lead to different PSFs. The unique and novel design of this experiment allows us to simultaneously test for the impacts of temporal effects, plant community composition and plant growth strategy on PSFs. Here, we describe the experimental design and demonstrate why this effective design is ideal to advance our understanding of PSFs in the field. (C) 2019 The Authors.

As experiments progress. there is a growing need for adequate theories and models to provide robust interpretations and generalisations of experimental results. and to Formulate new hypotheses. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances that have been made on the two major questions in this area: (1) How does biodiversity affect the magnitude of ecosystem processes (short-term effects of biodiversity)? (2) How does biodiversity contribute to the stability and maintenance of ecosystem processes in the face of perturbations (lung-term effects of biodiversity)? Positive short-term effects of species diversity on ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity. and nutrient retention, have been explained by two major types of mechanisms: (1) Functional niche complementarity (the complementarity effect). and (2) selection of extreme trait values (the selection effect). In both cases, biodiversity provides a range of phenotypic trait variation. In the complementarity effect, trait variation then forms the basis For a permanent association of species that enhances collective performance. In the selection effect, trait variation comes into play only as an initial condition, and a selective process then promotes dominance by species with extreme trait values. Major differences between within-sire effects of biodiversity and across-sits productivity diversity patterns have also been clarified. The local effects of diversity on ecosystem processes are expected to be masked by the effects of varying environmental parameters in across-site comparisons. A major reappraisal of the paradigm that has dominated during the last decades seems necessary if we are to account for long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. The classical deterministic, equilibrium approaches to stability do not explain the reduced temporal variability of aggregate ecosystem properties thar has been observed in more diverse systems. On the other hand, stochastic, nonequilibrium approaches do show two types of biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity in a fluctuating environment: (1) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance, and (2) a performance enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean. The basic mechanisms involved in these long-term insurance effects are very similar to those that operate in short-term biodiversity effects: temporal niche complementarity, and selection of extreme trait values. The ability of species diversity to provide an insurance against environmental fluctuations and a reservoir of variation allowing adaptation to changing conditions may be critical in a long-term perspective. These recent theoretical developments in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem Functioning suggest that linking community and ecosystem ecology is a fruitful avenue, which paves the way for a new ecological synthesis.","Ecole Normale Super, UMR 7625, Ecol Lab, F-75230 Paris 05, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Loreau, M (autor correspondente), Ecole Normale Super, UMR 7625, Ecol Lab, 46 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 05, France.",loreau@ens.fr,,,,,,NA,92,663,755,22,588,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,2000,91,1,,,,NA,3,17,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910101.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910101.x,NA,,15,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,372ML,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000165237400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We synthesize classical concepts and the recent literature on a wide range of aspects of leaf venation. We describe 10 major structural features that contribute to multiple key functions, and scale up to leaf and plant performance. We describe the development and plasticity of leaf venation and its adaptation across environments globally, and a new global data compilation indicating trends relating vein length per unit area to climate, growth form and habitat worldwide. We synthesize the evolution of vein traits in the major plant lineages throughout paleohistory, highlighting the multiple origins of individual traits. We summarize the strikingly diverse current applications of leaf vein research in multiple fields of science and industry. A unified core understanding will enable an increasing range of plant biologists to incorporate leaf venation into their research.","[Sack, Lawren; Scoffoni, Christine] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Sack, L (autor correspondente), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",lawrensack@ucla.edu,"Sack, Lawren/A-5492-2008","Sack, Lawren/0000-0002-7009-7202","National Science Foundation [IOS-0753233, IOS-1147292]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to M.

Climate change and grazing could directly alter ecosystem functioning and stability, or indirectly by changing species diversity, composition and plant functional traits. By synthesizing results from publications of the most recent 30-years, we found that effects of climate change and grazing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning varied from positive to negative, depending on different scenarios. Generally, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), belowground net primary production (BNPP), and species richness showed strong negative responses to 4 degrees C warming, 50% precipitation decrease, and high grazing intensity. Responses of ANPP, BNPP and species richness to precipitation increase were mostly positive, whereas their responses to 2 degrees C warming and low-to-moderate grazing intensity varied from positive to negative. Negative effects of 2 degrees C warming on ANPP were substantially greater in grasslands that had been grazed than those that had not been grazed, and larger in arid and semi-arid grasslands than those in sub-humid and humid grasslands. Under 50% precipitation increase, ANPP responses were larger in grazed than ungrazed grasslands, and bigger in arid and semi-arid than sub-humid and humid grasslands. High levels of grazing intensity had greater effects on productivity and species richness than did warming and precipitation decrease. Currently, although there are increasing number of experiments which have included both climate change and grazing factors, more studies are needed to test the joint effects of climate change (e.g. warming, changes in precipitation patterns) and grazing (grazing intensity and livestock type) on biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Multi-factor experiments would provide a more comprehensive understanding for sustainable grassland management in future.","[Li, Wenhuai; Li, Xiang; Zhao, Yujin; Zheng, Shuxia; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiang; Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bai, YF (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Bai, YF (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Li, Wenhuai/A-1268-2015","Li, Wenhuai/0000-0002-1113-2020; Zhao, Yujin/0000-0003-0225-6491","National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFA0604702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31320103916, 31630010]",National Key Research and Development Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are very grateful to David Hooper for his valuable comments on an early version of our manuscript and for polishing the language.

Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence: a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A 'mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Grime, JP (autor correspondente), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",j.p.grime@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,NA,80,1754,1874,64,1124,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

Two hypotheses underpin many of the discussions. The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which proposes that biodiversity peaks at intermediate levels of disturbance, is often extended to predict that productivity follows the same response pattern. The Mass Ratio Hypothesis (MRH) proposes that the biological traits of the dominant species are the critical drivers of ecosystem function (e.g., productivity) and that these species increase in biomass rapidly after disturbance then stabilize. As a consequence, species diversity first peaks then declines after disturbance as a few species dominate the site. Both provide a conceptual link among disturbance, species diversity and productivity (an index of ecosystem function). We assessed the current state of empirical support for these two hypotheses with a literature survey and determined if their conformance is related to ecosystem type or site productivity. Conformance of IDH reported in past reviews (considering all ecosystems) ranged from 16 to 21%. This contrasts with our finding that in terrestrial ecosystems conformance to IDH was 46% (22 of 48 studies), 17% studies reported non-compliance, and 23% reported inconclusive results. Most studies explained their results with respect to IDH or MRH. Only two studies were specifically designed to test the validity of IDH or MRH. We conclude that (i) the IDH is mostly applicable to predict species diversity response to disturbance in upland sites of medium to high productivity and the MRH is applicable to organic sites of low productivity; (ii) there is a critical need for more studies specifically designed to test these hypotheses in natural ecosystems using common protocols; and (iii) enhanced understanding of these models will add value in refining management policies and in the selection of meaningful diversity indicators of sustainability.","[Kershaw, H.

The provision of these services depends on the control exerted on the biogeochemistry and plant diversity of the system by the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., grazing or mowing intensity. Biogeochemical models incorporate a mechanistic view of the functioning of grasslands and provide a sound basis for studying the underlying processes. However, in these models, the simulation of biogeochemical cycles is generally not coupled to simulation of plant species dynamics, which leads to considerable uncertainty about the quality of predictions. Ecological models, on the other hand, do account for biodiversity with approaches adopted from plant demography, but without linking the dynamics of plant species to the biogeochemical processes occurring at the community level, and this hampers the models' capacity to assess resilience against abiotic stresses such as drought and nutrient limitation. While setting out the state-of-the-art developments of biogeochemical and ecological modelling, we explore and highlight the role of plant diversity in the regulation of the ecosystem processes underlying the ecosystems services provided by multi-species grasslands. An extensive literature and model survey was carried out with an emphasis on technically advanced models reconciling biogeochemistry and biodiversity, which are readily applicable to managed grasslands in temperate latitudes. We propose a roadmap of promising developments in modelling.","[Van Oijen, Marcel] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Meteorol, Pazmany Ps 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Barcza, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Sci, Excellence Ctr, Brunszvik U 2, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary; [Barcza, Zoltan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Confalonieri, Roberto; Movedi, Ermes] Univ Milan, Cassandra Lab, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Korhonen, Panu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Halolantie 31A, Maaninka 71750, Finland; [Kroeel-Dulay, Gyoergy; Lellei-Kovacs, Eszter] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Louarn, Gaetan] INRAE, URP3F, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Louault, Frederique; Martin, Raphael; Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Bellocchi, Gianni] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Moulin, Thibault] Agroscope, Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rolinski, Susanne; Wirth, Stephen Bjoern] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Viovy, Nicolas] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LSCE, IPSL,CEA,UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; University of Milan; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; INRAE; INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); VetAgro Sup; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Van Oijen, M (autor correspondente), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bush Estate, Penicuik EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland.",mvano@ceh.ac.uk; zoltan.barcza@ttk.elte.hu; Roberto.Confalonieri@Unimi.It; panu.korhonen@luke.fi; kroel-dulay.gyorgy@okologia.mta.hu; lellei-kovacs.eszter@okologia.mta.hu; gaetan.louarn@inrae.fr; frederique.louault@inrae.fr; raphael.martin@inrae.fr; thibault.moulin@agroscope.admin.ch; ermes.movedi@unimi.it; catherine.picon-cochard@inrae.fr; rolinski@pik-potsdam.de; Nicolas.Viovy@Lsce.Ipsl.Fr; wirth@pik-potsdam.de; gianni.bellocchi@inrae.fr,"Lellei-Kovács, Eszter/GPL-6111-2022; Gaëtan, Louarn/C-4454-2013; Viovy, Nicolas/S-2631-2018; Barcza, Zoltán/G-3880-2014; Picon-Cochard, Catherine/J-3954-2013","Gaëtan, Louarn/0000-0003-3701-7036; Viovy, Nicolas/0000-0002-9197-6417; Barcza, Zoltán/0000-0002-1278-0636; Korhonen, Panu/0000-0002-0274-6362; Bellocchi, Gianni/0000-0003-2712-7979; Martin, Raphael/0000-0001-8778-7915; LOUAULT, Frederique/0000-0002-9430-4261; Picon-Cochard, Catherine/0000-0001-7728-8936",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir' [16-IDEX-0001 CAP 20-25]; Research Council of Norway through project MYR [281109]; Environment & Rural A ffairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP) (Welsh Government) [C210/2016/2017]; UKCentre for Ecology Hydrology [06297]; Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund; Hungarian Government [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00028]; OP RDE [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803]; project DivCSA (the Academy of Finland) [316215]; project Climasteppe (BMBF) [01DJ18012],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir'(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Research Council of Norway through project MYR(Research Council of Norway); Environment & Rural A ffairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP) (Welsh Government); UKCentre for Ecology Hydrology; Szechenyi 2020 programme; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Hungarian Government; OP RDE; project DivCSA (the Academy of Finland); project Climasteppe (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program `Investissements d'Avenir' (16-IDEX-0001 CAP 20-25).

Indeed, ecosystems provide provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about US$ 232 ha(-1) year(-1). Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that influence plant diversity of permanent grasslands, and we describe underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of permanent grasslands cannot be explained simply by agricultural management rules, e.g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape, e.g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity, acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major species sources for permanent grasslands according to the seed flow. We discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant species composition of permanent grasslands and the necessity to study plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model based on three ecological challenges-dispersal, establishment, and persistence-that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity, and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape heterogeneity on plant diversity. Last, we discuss the ability of farmers to manage each factor and the necessity of such study in the improvement of the current agro-environment schemes efficiency for farmland biodiversity restoration or preservation.","[Amiaud, Bernard; Plantureux, Sylvain] Nancy Univ, UMR, INRA, Agron & Environm Nancy Colmar, 2 Ave Foret Haye, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Gaujour, Etienne; Mignolet, Catherine] ASTER Mirecourt, INRA, UR55, F-88500 Mirecourt, France",INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; INRAE,"Amiaud, B (autor correspondente), Nancy Univ, UMR, INRA, Agron & Environm Nancy Colmar, 2 Ave Foret Haye, F-54505 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",Bernard.Amiaud@ensaia.inpl-nancy.fr,,,"French Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries","French Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries","This review was made within the DIVA 2 project (public action, agriculture, and biodiversity) Design and ownership of agri-environmental measure to obligation of result on pasture: Reconciling agricultural and ecological relevance in public action for biodiversity? funded by the French Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries.

These assumptions allow model parameters to be estimated from current species ranges. Deterioration of growing conditions due to climate change, e.g. more severe drought, will cause local extinction. However, for many plant species, the predicted climate change of higher minimum temperatures and longer growing seasons means, improved growing conditions. Biogeographical models may under some circumstances predict that a species will become locally extinct, despite improved growing conditions, because they are based on an assumption of equilibrium and this forces the species range to match the species-specific macroclimatic thresholds. We argue that such model predictions should be rejected unless there is evidence either that competition influences the position of the range margins or that a certain physiological mechanism associated with the apparent improvement in growing conditions negatively affects the species performance. We illustrate how a process-based vegetation model can be used to ascertain whether such a physiological cause exists. To avoid potential modelling errors of this type, we propose a method that constrains the scenario predictions of the envelope models by changing the geographical distribution of the dominant plant functional type. Consistent modelling results are very important for evaluating how changes in species areas affect local functional trait diversity and hence ecosystem functioning and resilience, and for inferring the implications for conservation management in the face of climate change.","[Kramer, Koen; Bijlsma, Rienk-Jan] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Phys Geog, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France",Wageningen University & Research; Goethe University Frankfurt; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie,"Kramer, K (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",koen.kramer@wur.nl,"Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010","Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274",project DynTerra of the Knowledge Base of the Dutch Ministry of Economics Agriculture and Innovation [KB-14-002-032]; project CSR of the Knowledge Base of the Dutch Ministry of Economics Agriculture and Innovation [KB-14-011-007]; EU-FP6 Integrated Project ECOCHANGE (Challenges in assessing and forecasting biodiversity and ecosystem changes in Europe) [066866 GOCE]; ANR DIVERSITALP project [ANR 07-BDIV-014],project DynTerra of the Knowledge Base of the Dutch Ministry of Economics Agriculture and Innovation; project CSR of the Knowledge Base of the Dutch Ministry of Economics Agriculture and Innovation; EU-FP6 Integrated Project ECOCHANGE (Challenges in assessing and forecasting biodiversity and ecosystem changes in Europe); ANR DIVERSITALP project(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"The discussions and comments by Eric Arets, Richard Bradshaw, Csaba Matyas, Wim Ozinga and Claire Vos are much appreciated.

The primary driving force for global change is precipitation and the secondary one is land use intensity. Research progresses have been performed during the past decade in the following aspects: ecological database development, climate and its variability, ecophysiological response of plants to environments, vegetation and landscape changes, biodiversity patterns and their changes, plant functional types and traits with relation to climatic gradient, productivity and carbon dynamics, pollen-vegetation relationship, trace gas emissions, land use and land cover changes, as well as biogeographical and biogeochemical modelling. In order to achieve the higher level of integrated research, the NECT needs the consistent basic data sets within the same framework, further field experiments and observations, integrated simulations of vegetation structure, process and function from patch, landscape to biome scales, intercomparisons of results and simulations within the transect and to other IGBP transects, multidisciplinary research, national and international co-ordinates, and full scientific plan and implementation strategy.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Max Planck Society","Ni, J (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",jni@ns.ibeas.ac.cn,"Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",,,,NA,34,9,13,1,25,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0577-7496,1672-9072,,ACTA BOT SIN,Acta Bot.

Periods of falling and low [CO2] in the palaeo-record appear to have created selective pressure for important adaptations in modern plants. Today, rising [CO2] is a key component of anthropogenic global environmental change that will impact plants and the ecosystem goods and services they deliver. Currently, there is limited evidence that natural plant populations have evolved in response to contemporary increases in [CO2] in ways that increase plant productivity or fitness, and no evidence for incidental breeding of crop varieties to achieve greater yield enhancement from rising [CO2]. Evolutionary responses to elevated [CO2] have been studied by applying selection in controlled environments, quantitative genetics and trait-based approaches. Findings to date suggest that adaptive changes in plant traits in response to future [CO2] will not be consistently observed across species or environments and will not be large in magnitude compared with physiological and ecological responses to future [CO2]. This lack of evidence for strong evolutionary effects of elevated [CO2] is surprising, given the large effects of elevated [CO2] on plant phenotypes. New studies under more stressful, complex environmental conditions associated with climate change may revise this view. Efforts are underway to engineer plants to: (i) overcome the limitations to photosynthesis from today's [CO2] and (ii) benefit maxi-mally from future, greater [CO2]. Targets range in scale from manipulating the function of a single enzyme (e. g. Rubisco) to adding metabolic pathways from bacteria as well as engineering the structural and functional components necessary for C-4 photosynthesis into C-3 leaves. Successfully improving plant performance will depend on combining the knowledge of the evolutionary context, cellular basis and physiological integration of plant responses to varying [CO2].","[Leakey, Andrew D.

Tropical forests present an important opportunity, as they take up and store large amounts of carbon. It is often suggested that forests with high biodiversity have large stocks and high rates of carbon uptake. Evidence is, however, scattered across geographic areas and scales, and it remains unclear whether biodiversity is just a co-benefit or also a requirement for the maintenance of carbon stocks and uptake. Here, we perform a quantitative review of empirical studies that analyzed the relationships between plant biodiversity attributes and carbon stocks and carbon uptake in tropical forests. Our results show that biodiversity attributes related to species, traits or structure significantly affect carbon stocks or uptake in 64% of the evaluated relationships. Average vegetation attributes (community-mean traits and structural attributes) are more important for carbon stocks, whereas variability in vegetation attributes (i.e., taxonomic diversity) is important for both carbon stocks and uptake. Thus, different attributes of biodiversity have complementary effects on carbon stocks and uptake. These biodiversity effects tend to be more often significant in mature forests at broad spatial scales than in disturbed forests at local spatial scales. Biodiversity effects are also more often significant when confounding variables are not included in the analyses, highlighting the importance of performing a comprehensive analysis that adequately accounts for environmental drivers. In summary, biodiversity is not only a co-benefit, but also a requirement for short- and long-term maintenance of carbon stocks and enhancement of uptake. Climate change policies should therefore include the maintenance of multiple attributes of biodiversity as an essential requirement to achieve long-term climate change mitigation goals.","[van der Sande, Masha T.; Poorter, Lourens; Pena-Claros, Marielos] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Sande, Masha T.; Arets, Eric J.

Mediterranean climates are characterized by a drought season but its length and severity can be highly variable across regions. In this review, we explored population genetic variation in functional traits and fitness in Mediterranean oak and pine species. We tested the hypothesis that increased drought tolerance has evolved as an adaptation to xeric and warm areas of the Mediterranean climate while increased competitive abilities have been favoured in more mesic regions, following a productivity-persistence trade-off within species. We first reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of studies on Pinus sp. and Quercus sp. from Mediterranean climates, and then analysed a set of unpublished data from Spanish common garden experiments of species from the Mediterranean Basin, searching for evidence of trait genetic variation among populations, local adaptation and trait-environment associations. The meta-analysis showed that 82.9% (95% CI 75.7-89.4) of traits per study showed significant population genetic differentiation and that 52.5% (35.6-69.2) of traits in studies with two or more Mediterranean environments exhibited population-by-environment interaction. Population differences in traits related to drought tolerance, cold hardiness and fitness were usually correlated with provenance precipitation and temperature gradients, suggesting that adaptation to different climatic regimes is an important process driving intraspecific genetic divergence. Within the Spanish trial network, however, predicted fitness functions based on climatic transfer distance failed to reveal significantly higher fitness of populations at experimental sites with climates closer to their provenances' ones. Neither the literature review nor the new analyses of the Spanish trial network provided evidence of a negative association between growth- and persistence-related traits at the intraspecific level. Synthesis. Population genetic differentiation in functional traits and fitness is common in Mediterranean species, driven, at least in part, by the adaptation to contrasting temperature and precipitation regimes. Because of experimental constraints or biological reality, our study failed to detect a trade-off between resource-use strategies within species, calling for future studies to investigate further whether intraspecific evolution of stress tolerance occurs at the expense of growth potential in Mediterranean environments or not.","[Ramirez-Valiente, Jose Alberto; Santos del Blanco, Luis; Alia, Ricardo; Robledo-Arnuncio, Juan J.; Climent, Jose] CSIC, Dept Forest Ecol & Genet, Forest Res Ctr INIA, Madrid, Spain; [Ramirez-Valiente, Jose Alberto] CREAF, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Barcelona, Spain; [Santos del Blanco, Luis; Alia, Ricardo; Robledo-Arnuncio, Juan J.; Climent, Jose] Univ Valladolid INIA, Res Inst Sustainable Forest Management, Palencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; Universidad de Valladolid,"Ramirez-Valiente, JA (autor correspondente), CSIC, Dept Forest Ecol & Genet, Forest Res Ctr INIA, Madrid, Spain.;Ramirez-Valiente, JA (autor correspondente), CREAF, Ctr Ecol Res & Forestry Applicat, Barcelona, Spain.",josealberto.ramirezvaliente@gmail.com,"Robledo-Arnuncio, Juan José/G-6792-2012; Climent, José/B-9090-2009; Ramirez-Valiente, Jose Alberto/G-7850-2016; Santos-del-blanco, Luis/L-9523-2014","Robledo-Arnuncio, Juan José/0000-0002-3909-8928; Climent, José/0000-0002-0815-2645; Ramirez-Valiente, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-5951-2938; Santos-del-blanco, Luis/0000-0003-3602-3880",Spanish Ministry of Agriculture [AEG-17-048]; Ministry of Science [RTI2018-094691-B-C32]; European Union [773383],"Spanish Ministry of Agriculture(Spanish Government); Ministry of Science(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); European Union(European Commission)","Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Grant/Award Number: AEG-17-048; Ministry of Science, Grant/Award Number: RTI2018-094691-B-C32; European Union Horizon 2020, Grant/Award Number: 773383",NA,156,12,12,9,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

As g(m) scales positively with foliage photosynthetic capacity (A), the CO2 drawdown from substomatal cavities (C-i) to chloroplasts (C-C, C-i-C-C=A/g(m)) rather than g(m) alone characterizes the mesophyll diffusion limitations of photosynthesis. The dependencies of g(m) on A, foliage structure (leaf dry mass per unit area, M-A), and the resulting drawdowns across a dataset of 81 species of contrasting foliage structure and photosynthetic potentials measured under non-stressed conditions were analysed to describe the structure-driven potential photosynthetic limitations due to g(m). Further the effects of key environmental stress factors and leaf and plant developmental alterations on g(m) and CO2 drawdown were evaluated and the implications of varying g(m) on foliage photosynthesis in the field were simulated. The meta-analysis demonstrated that g(m) of non-stressed leaves was negatively correlated with M-A, and despite the positive relationship between g(m) and A, the CO2 drawdown was larger in leaves with more robust structure. The correlations were stronger with mass-based g(m) and A, probably reflecting the circumstance that mesophyll diffusion is a complex three-dimensional process that scales better with mesophyll volume-weighted than with leaf area-weighted traits. The analysis of key environmental stress effects on g(m) and CO2 drawdowns demonstrated that the effect of individual stresses on CO2 drawdowns varies depending on the stress effects on foliage structure and assimilation rates. Leaf diffusion limitations are larger in non-senescent older leaves and also in senescent leaves, again reflecting more robust leaf structure and/or non-co-ordinated alterations in leaf photosynthesis and g(m). According to simulation analyses, in plants with a larger part of the overall diffusion conductance from the ambient atmosphere to the chloroplasts in the mesophyll, photosynthesis is less sensitive to changes in stomatal conductance. Accordingly, in harsher environments that support vegetation with tougher long-living stress-tolerant leaves with lower g(m), reductions in stomatal conductance that are common during stress periods are expected to alter photosynthesis less than in species where a larger part of the total diffusion limitation is determined by stomata. While structural robustness improves plant performance under environmental stress, low g(m) and inherently large CO2 drawdown in robust leaves limits the photosynthesis of these plants more severely under favourable conditions when stomatal conductance is high. The differences in overall responsiveness to environmental modifications of plants with varying g(m) need consideration in current large-scale ecosystem productivity models.","[Niinemets, Uelo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Diaz-Espejo, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Flexas, Jaume; Galmes, Jeroni] Univ Illes Balears, Grp Recerca Biol Plantes Condic Mediterranies, E-07122 Palma de Mallorca, Spain; [Warren, Charles R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Estonian University of Life Sciences; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS); Universitat de les Illes Balears; University of Sydney,"Niinemets, U (autor correspondente), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",ylo.niinemets@emu.ee,"Galmés, Jeroni/J-6749-2017; Diaz-Espejo, Antonio/B-5361-2008; Flexas, Jaume/C-1898-2012; Diaz-Espejo, Antonio/S-3744-2019; Niinemets, Ülo/A-3816-2008; Warren, Charles/A-6013-2011","Galmés, Jeroni/0000-0002-7299-9349; Diaz-Espejo, Antonio/0000-0002-4711-2494; Flexas, Jaume/0000-0002-3069-175X; Diaz-Espejo, Antonio/0000-0002-4711-2494; Niinemets, Ülo/0000-0002-3078-2192; Warren, Charles/0000-0002-0788-4713",Estonian Ministry of Education and Science [SF1090065s07]; Estonian Academy of Sciences,"Estonian Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); Estonian Academy of Sciences",The authors' work on mesophyll diffusion conductance has been supported by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Science (grant SF1090065s07) and the Estonian Academy of Sciences.,NA,179,224,236,5,100,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0022-0957,1460-2431,,J EXP BOT,J.

One ecosystem property is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are stronger predictors of the mean size of bees, moths, frugivorous birds, and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and the abiotic environment, but suggest that temperature is the most relevant predictor of mean animal body size. Community-weighted means of plant traits and body sizes appear unsuitable to capture the complexity of plant-animal interactions.","[Costa, David Schellenberger; Kleyer, Michael] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Oldenburg, Germany; [Classen, Alice; Peters, Marcell; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Ferger, Stefan; Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany; [Helbig-Bonitz, Maria] Univ Ulm, Inst Expt Ecol, Ulm, Germany; [Boehning-Gaese, Katrin] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Frankfurt, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Wurzburg; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Ulm University; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Costa, DS (autor correspondente), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Oldenburg, Germany.",david.schellenberger.costa@uni-oldenburg.de,"Classen, Alice/H-7655-2013; Böhning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019; Schellenberger Costa, David/AAT-5413-2020","Böhning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586; Schellenberger Costa, David/0000-0003-1747-1506; Classen, Alice/0000-0002-7813-8806; Peters, Marcell/0000-0002-1262-0827","German Science Foundation [KL 756/5-1, FOR 1246]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was made possible by a grant from the German Science Foundation (grant number KL 756/5-1) in the framework of the Collaborative Research Unit FOR 1246 Kilimanjaro ecosystems under global change: Linking,NA,85,11,14,5,38,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,mar.-20,2017,12,3,,,,NA,,,e0174157,10.1371/journal.pone.0174157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174157,NA,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,ER6VC,28319155,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000398945800054,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its importance for ecosystem functioning, the importance of historical environmental conditions as determinants of FD (functional diversity) remains largely unstudied. We quantified the geographic distributions of plant FD (richness and dispersion) across Europe using distribution and functional trait information for 2702 plant species. We then compared the importance of historical and contemporary factors to determine the relevance of past conditions as predictors of current plant FD in Europe. For this, we compared the strength of the relationships between FD with temperature and precipitation stability since the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum), accessibility to LGM refugia, and contemporary environmental conditions (climate, productivity, soil, topography, and land use). Functional richness and dispersion exhibited geographic patterns with strong associations to the environmental history of the region. The effect size of accessibility to LGM refugia and climate stability since the LGM was comparable to that of the contemporary predictors. Both functional richness and dispersion increased with temperature stability since the LGM and accessibility to LGM refugia. Functional richness' geographic pattern was primarily associated with accessibility to LGM refugia growing degree-days, land use heterogeneity, diversity of soil types, and absolute minimum winter temperature. Functional dispersion's geographic pattern was primarily associated with accessibility to LGM refugia growing degree-days and absolute minimum winter temperature. The high explained variance and model support of historical predictors are consistent with the idea that long-term variability in environmental conditions supplements contemporary factors in shaping FD patterns at continental scales. Given the importance of FD for ecosystem functioning, future climate change may elicit not just short-term shifts in ecosystem functioning, but also long-term functional disequilibria.","[Ordonez, Alejandro; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Ordonez, A (autor correspondente), Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",alejandro.ordonez@bios.au.dk,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551",ERC [310886],ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This article is a contribution to the HISTFUNC project (ERC Starting Grant 310886 to J-C.S.).,NA,75,17,17,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

To understand how rare species may influence ecosystem functioning, this study quantifies the contribution of species based on their relative level of rarity to community functional diversity using a trait-based approach. Given that rarity can be defined in several different ways, we use four different definitions of rarity: abundance (mean and maximum), geographic range, and habitat specificity. We find that rarer species contribute to functional diversity when rarity is defined by maximum abundance, geographic range, and habitat specificity. However, rarer species are functionally redundant when rarity is defined by mean abundance. Furthermore, when using abundance-weighted analyses, we find that rare species typically contribute significantly less to functional diversity than common species due to their low abundances. These results suggest that rare species have the potential to play an important role in ecosystem functioning, either by offering novel contributions to functional diversity or via functional redundancy depending on how rare species are defined. Yet, these contributions are likely to be greatest if the abundance of rare species increases due to environmental change. We argue that given the paucity of data on rare species, understanding the contribution of rare species to community functional diversity is an important first step to understanding the potential role of rare species in ecosystem functioning.","[Jain, Meha; Flynn, Dan F.

Based on a dataset from 10 sites investiagted annually from 2004 to 2010 in tropical forest in Southwestern China, we used mixed-effect model and variation partitioning to test the relative importance of stand structural attributes vs. biodiversity on biomass, productivity and their stability. We found that stand structural attributes are dominant predictors for forest biomass and productivity, while diversity is predominant in affecting biomass and productivity stability at all grain sizes (0.04 hm(2)similar to 0.12 hm(2)). Moreover, functional diversity seemed to be more important for biomass, productivity and their stability than taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and richness was more important than the other two diversity components (evenness and divergence). Our results reconcile the recent debate on the relative importance of diversity vs. stand factors on ecosystem properties, and suggest that forest management to adjust stand structure is an effective way to increase forest carbon storage rapidly, but biodiversity conservation may be crucial for ecosystem stability under climate change.","[Guo, Zhiwen; Wang, Xiangping; Fan, Dayong] Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Wang, XP (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangxiangping@bjfu.edu.cn,"Guo, Zhiwen/HHN-8179-2022","fan, dayong/0000-0002-2591-6029","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502104, 2017YFC0503901]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870430]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502104, 2017YFC0503901), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870430).",NA,85,5,8,37,91,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Ecological restoration can restore desirable ecosystem functions, such as creating habitat for animal conservation and carbon sequestration as woody biomass. In order to maintain these beneficial ecosystem functions, restoration projects need to mature into self-perpetuating communities. Here we compared the ecological attributes of two types of restoration, active tree plantings with passive natural forest regeneration (natural regrowth) to existing remnant vegetation in a cleared agricultural landscape. Specifically, we measured differences between forest categories in factors that may predict future restoration failure or ecosystem collapse: aboveground plant biomass and biomass accrual over time (for regrowing stands), plant density and size class distributions, and diversity of functional groups based on seed dispersal and growth strategy traits. We found that natural regrowth and planted forests were similar in many ecological characteristics, including biomass accrual. Despite this, planted stands contained fewer tree recruit and shrub individuals, which may be due to limited recruitment in plantings. If this continues, these forests may be at risk of collapsing into nonforest states after mature trees senesce. Lower shrub density and richness of mid-story trees may lead to lower structural complexity in planting plots, and alongside lower richness of fleshy-fruited plant species may reduce animal resources and animal use of the restored stand. In our study region, natural regrowth may result in restored woodland communities with greater conservation and carbon mitigation value.","[Staples, Timothy L.; Mayfield, Margaret M.; Dwyer, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [England, Jacqueline R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Melbourne, Qld 3169, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Staples, TL (autor correspondente), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.;Staples, TL (autor correspondente), CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",timothy.staples@uqconnect.edu.au,"Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Staples, Tim/AEI-0009-2022; Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012; Mayfield, Margaret Morrow/GLT-4023-2022; England, Jacqueline R/G-6417-2011","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; England, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-3371-1509; Staples, Timothy/0000-0002-8550-2661",,,,NA,74,14,14,9,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Few studies, however, have tested how plant responses to grazing are mediated by resource availability and plant functional group identity. We examined the effects of grazing on functional traits across a broad range of species along a soil moisture gradient in Inner Mongolia grassland. Our results showed that trait syndromes of plant size (individual biomass) and shoot growth (leaf N content and leaf density) distinguished plant species responses to grazing. The effects of grazing on functional traits were mediated by soil moisture and dependent on functional group identity. For most species, grazing decreased plant height but increased leaf N and specific leaf area (SLA) along the moisture gradient. Grazing enhanced the community-weighted attributes (leaf NCWM and SLACWM), which were triggered mainly by the positive trait responses of annuals and biennials and perennial grasses, and increased relative abundance of perennial forbs. Our results suggest that grazing-induced species turnover and increased intraspecific trait variability are two drivers for the observed changes in community weighted attributes. The dominant perennial bunchgrasses exhibited mixed tolerance-resistance strategies to grazing and mixed acquisitive-conservative strategies in resource utilization.","[Zheng, Shuxia; Li, Wenhuai; Lan, Zhichun; Ren, Haiyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kaibo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS","Zheng, SX (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",zsx@ibcas.ac.cn,"Li, Wenhuai/A-1268-2015","Li, Wenhuai/0000-0002-1113-2020",National Natural Science Foundation of China [30900193]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050400],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),We appreciate B.Y. and P.Q. for their insightful comments on an early version of this manuscript.

However, the manner in which invasive plants alter ecosystem functioning and trophic interactions is highly variable can occur through the direct effects of the invader's abundance and its indirect effects via changes in community diversity. Understanding the nature of these interactions between plant invasion, community diversity and ecosystem functioning can provide insight for ecosystem managers. We evaluated whether plant invasion alters the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) by comparing BEF models that either include or subtract the diversity and function values associated with the invasive vine,Vincetoxicum rossicum.To do this, we (1) characterizeV. rossicumwithin the functional trait space of the regional species pool, (2) assess how different components of plant biodiversity vary along aV. rossicuminvasion gradient, and (3) examine howV. rossicuminvasion affects BEF relationships and trophic interactions, both at the plot-scale and incrementally along a site-level invasion gradient. In general, we found thatV. rossicuminvasion was associated with significant declines in plant community diversity across a suite of biodiversity measures; a consequence ofV. rossicum's functional trait structure (height and specific leaf area). We also found thatV. rossicuminvasion resulted in significantly greater productivity (i.e., dominance effects in the inclusion model), but also that the diversity of the remaining resident community was positively associated with productivity (i.e., niche complementarity in the subtraction model). Further, we observed that while the relationship between flower cover and pollinator diversity was positive for both the inclusion and subtraction models, this relationship was stronger in the absence ofV. rossicum. Our findings suggest that while plant invasion can result in enhanced productivityviadominance effects, this comes at the cost of significant declines in diversity. However, it is also the case that remaining resident diversity can exhibit positive effects on multiple functions and support for higher trophic levels.","[Livingstone, Stuart W.; Isaac, Marney E.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Livingstone, Stuart W.; Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough,"Livingstone, SW (autor correspondente), Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.;Livingstone, SW (autor correspondente), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",s.livingstone@utoronto.ca,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; Livingstone, Stuart/0000-0003-1031-8904","Canada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [386,151]; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation [ER13-09-121]; Canada Research Chairs program; Parks Canada; Rouge National Urban Park; TD Professor of Urban Forest Conservation and Biology chair","Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Ontario Research Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Canada Research Chairs program(Canada Research Chairs); Parks Canada; Rouge National Urban Park; TD Professor of Urban Forest Conservation and Biology chair","We wish to thank Diane Srivastava, Oscar Godoy, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

Plant functional traits which reflect the physiological and ecological processes of plants in particular ecosystems are crucial for indicating the variations in the ecosystem structure and function. To better understand the adaptation strategies of plants to hydrological changes and provide a scientific basis for the selection of species in the re-vegetation of the newly formed ecosystems, 14 leaf functional traits and leaf economics spectrum (LES) of 19 dominant plants under different hydrological conditions were investigated in the water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The results showed that anti-seasonal flooding has significant effects on the leaf functional traits of plants (P < 0.05). The net photosynthetic rate of annual plants was significantly higher than that of perennial plants (P < 0.05), and there was a significant correlation between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits (P < 0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that soil water content and available phosphorus were the main factors affecting the leaf function of dominant species, indicating that hydrologic factors were still important environmental factors affecting leaf functional traits of dominant species in the WLFZ. And annuals from the WLFZ have characteristics of thick leaves, high photosynthetic rate, short lifespan, and high nutrient concentrations, which make them close to the fast investment-return end of LES. On the contrary, perennials are close to the slow investment-return end of LES. The high productivity investment of annuals is better than the high defense investment of perennials for adapting to the special habitats in the WLFZ. These results indicated that different functional plants in the WLFZ of the TGR under different hydrological regimes can adopt different strategies by weighing the associations and trade-offs between their economic traits.","[Li, Xiaoling; He, Di; Chen, Gong; Yang, Jin; Yang, Zhengjian; Guo, Xiao juan; Wang, Congfeng; Zhu, Shijiang; Huang, Yingping; Chen, Hongfeng] China Three Gorges Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Ctr Ecol Conservat & Manag, Minist Educ, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaoling; He, Di; Chen, Gong] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Biol & Pharmaceut Sci, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guiyun; Zhang, Dingjun] Three Gorges Corp, Rare Plants Res Inst Yangtze River, Yichang, Peoples R China; [Ye, Chen] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Peoples R China","China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS","Yang, ZJ (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Engn Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Hubei Int Sci & Technol Ctr Ecol Conservat & Manag, Minist Educ, Yichang, Peoples R China.;Huang, GY (corresponding author), Three Gorges Corp, Rare Plants Res Inst Yangtze River, Yichang, Peoples R China.",yangzj1984@ctgu.edu.cn; huang_guiyun@ctg.com.cn,"zhu, shijiang/E-1772-2013","Yang, Zhengjian/0009-0002-5905-7864","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779127, 51209122]; National 111 Intellectual Base [D20015]; Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education [KF2018-02]; Open Project fund of Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [E0520204]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019334]; Research Project on Seed Preservation Technology and Facilities of Rare Plants in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area-Investigation and Collection of Flooding-Tolerant Germplasm Resources [SDHZ2021346]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National 111 Intellectual Base; Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education; Open Project fund of Key Laboratory of Aquatic Plants and Watershed Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Project on Seed Preservation Technology and Facilities of Rare Plants in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area-Investigation and Collection of Flooding-Tolerant Germplasm Resources","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51779127 and 51209122), partially funded by National 111 Intellectual Base (D20015), the Open Research Program of the Engineering Research Center of Eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region of the Ministry of Education (No. KF2018-02).

This study aimed to assess the effects of termite mounds on the diversity of plant functional types (PFTs) and herbaceous' net aboveground primary productivity (NAPP) in plant communities (PCs) of the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve. PCs were identified through canonical correspondence analysis performed on 96 phytosociological releves' realized in plots of 900m(2). PFTs' diversity was compared between savannahs and mounds' plots using generalized linear models. In each plot, 7m(2) subplots were harvested and NAPP was determined. Linear mixed models were performed to assess change in herbaceous NAPP regarding species richness, graminoids' richness, specific leaf area and termite mounds. There is no specific plant community related to mounds. However, the occurrence of termite mounds induced an increase of woody and forbs diversity while the diversity of legumes and graminoids decreased. These diversity patterns led to decreasing of PCs' NAPP. This study confirms that termite-induced resource heterogeneity supports niche differentiation theory and increased savannah encroachment by woody species.","[Gbeffe, Alain K.; Houehanou, Thierry D.; Assede, Emeline S.

There are few robust tools available to link these processes, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long-term forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology. However, their relevance to tackle questions about the links between species composition, climate and forest functioning is unclear. In this regard, demonstrating the ability of gap models to predict the growth of forest stands at the annual parameterization scale resolution-representing a sensitive and integrated signal of tree functioning and mortality risk-appears as a fundamental step. In this study, we aimed at assessing the ability of a gap model to accurately predict forest growth in the short term and potential community composition in the long term, across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. To do so, we present the gap model ForCEEPS, calibrated using an original parameterization procedure for the main tree species in France. ForCEEPS was shown to satisfactorily predict forest annual growth (averaged over a few years) at the plot level from mountain to Mediterranean climates, regardless of the species. Such an accuracy was not gained at the cost of losing precision for long-term predictions, as the model showed a strong ability to predict potential community compositions. The mechanistic relevance of ForCEEPS parameterization was explored by showing the congruence between the values of key model parameter and species functional traits. We further showed that accounting for the spatial configuration of crowns within forest stands, the effects of climatic constraints and the variability of shade tolerances in the species community are all crucial to better predict short-term productivity with gap models. Synthesis. The dual ability of predicting short-term functioning and long-term community composition, as well as the balance between generality and realism (i.e. predicting accuracy) of the new generation of gap models may open great perspectives for the exploration of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, species coexistence mechanisms and the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems.

Understanding associations between shrub ecophysiological function, distribution and environment is necessary for predicting consequences of expansion. We evaluated the role of topographic gradients on upland shrub productivity to understand potential constraints on shrub expansion. At a low arctic tundra site near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada, we measured sap flow, stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits in green alder, and environmental predictors (water and nutrient availability and seasonal thaw depth) across a toposequence in alder patches. Seasonal thaw reduced stem sap flow whereas topographic position predicted stem water potential and productivity-related functional traits. Upslope shrubs were more water-limited than those downslope. Shrubs in drainage channels had traits associated with greater productivity than those on the tops of slopes. The effect of thaw depth on sap flow has implications for seasonal water-use patterns and warming impacts on tundra ecohydrology. Topographic variation in functional traits corresponds with observed spatial patterns of tundra shrub expansion along floodplains and concave hillslopes rather than in upland areas. Green alder is expanding rapidly across the low arctic tundra in northwestern North America; thus, anticipating the implications of its expansion is essential for predicting tundra function.","[Black, Katherine L.; Wallace, Cory A.; Baltzer, Jennifer L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Baltzer, JL (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",jbaltzer@wlu.ca,,"Baltzer, Jennifer/0000-0001-7476-5928; Black, Katherine/0000-0003-4652-120X; Wallace, Cory/0000-0003-2648-9046",ArcticNet; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Changing Cold Regions Network); Canadian Northern Studies Trust; Wilfrid Laurier University; Polar Continental Shelf Program; Polar Knowledge Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; Northern Scientific Training Program,"ArcticNet; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Changing Cold Regions Network)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canadian Northern Studies Trust; Wilfrid Laurier University; Polar Continental Shelf Program; Polar Knowledge Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Northern Scientific Training Program","Funding was provided by ArcticNet, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Changing Cold Regions Network), Canadian Northern Studies Trust, Wilfrid Laurier University, the Polar Continental Shelf Program, Polar Knowledge Canada, Canada Foundation for Innovation, Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and the Northern Scientific Training Program.

We use this approach along a chronosequence of disease infestation (Phytophthora cinnamomi) in the species-diverse Banksia woodlands of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). We compare the use of absolute (community-weighted totals-CWT) and relative cover data (community-weighted means-CWM) to demonstrate the importance of total cover change in reference to the Mass Ratio Hypothesis. Plant species cover-abundance was recorded along a space-for-time disease chronosequence, and functional trait data collected for the 48 dominant species from healthy vegetation. Six traits with deduced links to key ecosystem functions were measured for each species and values for two indices (CWT and CWM) compared along the disease chronosequence. Trait data was collected on plant height, growth form, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, root pattern and carbohydrate storage. Despite substantial shifts in individual species cover and a reduction in total species cover, the majority of CWM values did not change significantly following disease infestation. The use of relative cover-abundance data disregards important changes in total species cover, apparent from our comparative analysis. In contrast to CWMs, all CWT values were reduced following disease infestation, suggesting a potential reduction in productivity, reduced capacity as a carbon sink and altered site water balance. Verification of these potential changes in ecosystem functions is required using fine-scale quantitative techniques. The CWT index is complementary to traditional CWMs and useful when analysing changes in plant trait data where total species cover changes have been detected. In relation to P. cinnamomi infestation, shifts in CWT trait values indicate the ability of an introduced plant pathogen to have substantial indirect impacts beyond substantial floristic change.

However, the capability of plant traits to predict demographic rates remains uncertain, particularly in the context of trees experiencing a changing climate. Here we present data combining 17 plant traits associated with plant structure, metabolism and hydraulic status, with measurements of long-term mean, maximum and relative growth rates for 176 trees from the world's longest running tropical forest drought experiment. We demonstrate that plant traits can predict mean annual tree growth rates with moderate explanatory power. However, only combinations of traits associated more directly with plant functional processes, rather than more commonly employed traits like wood density or leaf mass per area, yield the power to predict growth. Critically, we observe a shift from growth being controlled by traits related to carbon cycling (assimilation and respiration) in well-watered trees, to traits relating to plant hydraulic stress in drought-stressed trees. We also demonstrate that even with a very comprehensive set of plant traits and growth data on large numbers of tropical trees, considerable uncertainty remains in directly interpreting the mechanisms through which traits influence performance in tropical forests.","[Rowland, Lucy; Bittencourt, Paulo R.

However, lack of adequate regulation of ranching activities can lead to the degradation of plant communities, which in turn can impact ecosystem functioning. In the arid ecosystems of north-central Chile, unregulated goat grazing is widespread. Because the vegetation has a relatively short evolutionary history of grazing, it is expected to be highly susceptible to this activity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of goat grazing on plant taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic community structure by comparing 39-year-old grazing exclusion plots and unprotected plots in an arid shrubland in north-central Chile. By integrating analyses of the impact of goat grazing on functional and phylogenetic diversity and dispersion, we studied the mechanisms behind goat impact and the potential consequences. Loss of functional and/or phylogenetic diversity can result in important losses in ecosystem function. As a measure of functional diversity, we recorded plant growth form, life span, and life form. We also reconstructed a phylogeny of all plant species found at the study site and determined the phylogenetic structure of the plant community in ungrazed and grazed areas. We found that goat grazing affected diversity and community composition, leading to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic biotic homogenization and causing overall community impoverishment. Goats acted as a habitat filter, increasing functional convergence and promoting the establishment of exotics plants, which can lead to further losses of biodiversity, decreased ecosystem function and overall lower ecosystem stability.

To restore degraded habitats under a facilitation framework, practitioners must correctly select both the benefactor (nurse) and the beneficiary (facilitated) species. Based on community assembly and species coexistence theory, we propose selecting plant species that largely differ in a suite of functional traits so that competition is minimized and facilitation maximized due to functional complementarity. To apply this guideline in a pilot restoration experiment performed in metalliferous mine tailings in South-Eastern Spain, we first built the plant-plant facilitative interaction network naturally occurring in a set of 12 tailings. After characterizing each species with 20 morphological and physiological traits, we verified that facilitative interactions were predominantly established between functionally distant species. Then, we designed a sowing experiment combining 50 nurse-facilitated species pairs separated by a wide range of functional distances. The success of seedling establishment significantly increased with the functional distance between the nurse and the facilitated plant species. Synthesis and applications. We encourage the use of ecological facilitation together with trait-based species selection to design restoration programmes based on the principle of increasing functional distance between target species. This method may not only promote the restoration of the plant cover but also impact paramount ecosystem functions, thus being an efficient low-cost restoration practice in abiotically stressful ecosystems.","[Antonio Navarro-Cano, Jose; Goberna, Marta; Verdu, Miguel] Ctr Invest Desertificac CSIC UVEG GV, Dept Plant Ecol, Moncada, Spain; [Goberna, Marta] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA),"Navarro-Cano, JA (autor correspondente), Ctr Invest Desertificac CSIC UVEG GV, Dept Plant Ecol, Moncada, Spain.",jose.a.navarro@uv.es,"Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/L-8281-2013; Goberna, Marta/A-9183-2012","Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; Navarro-Cano, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8091-1063; Goberna, Marta/0000-0001-5303-3429","I Convocatoria de ayudas de la Fundacion BBVA a proyectos deInvestigacion; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2014-58333-P, LIFE13NAT/ES/000436]",I Convocatoria de ayudas de la Fundacion BBVA a proyectos deInvestigacion(BBVA Foundation); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"I Convocatoria de ayudas de la Fundacion BBVA a proyectos deInvestigacion (project Mintegra); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: CGL2014-58333-P and LIFE13NAT/ES/000436",NA,58,27,27,6,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

During ecosystem restoration, for example on abandoned fields, plant communities start on bare soil, and diversity is often manipulated in a single sowing event. How such initial plant diversity manipulations influence plant biodiversity development and ecosystem functioning is not well understood. We examined how relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity, biomass production and stability develop over 16 yr in non-weeded plots sown with 15 species, four species, or that were not sown. We found that sown plant communities become functionally similar to unsown, naturally colonized plant communities. However, initial sowing treatments had long-lasting effects on species composition and taxonomic diversity. We found only few relationships between biomass production, or stability in biomass production, and functional or taxonomic diversity, and the ones we observed were negative. In addition, the cover of dominant plant species was positively related to biomass production and stability. We conclude that effects of introducing plant species at the start of secondary succession can persist for a long time, and that in secondary succession communities with natural plant species dynamics diversity-functioning relationships can be weak or negative. Moreover, our findings indicate that in systems where natural colonization of species is allowed effects of plant dominance may underlie diversity-functioning relationships.","[Veen, G.

There is extensive experimental evidence for the importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem functioning. However, such experiments typically prevent immigration by continuously removing non-target species, thereby questioning the generality of these findings to real-world ecosystems. This is particularly true in forest ecosystems where understorey herbaceous species are key biodiversity components but are usually weeded in tree diversity experiments. Consequently, little is known about how tree diversity influences the natural dynamics of understorey herbaceous layers. 2. We conducted a 3-year non-weeded tree diversity experiment composed of eight woody species differing widely in plant economic strategies. We examined how the functional diversity and identity of tree species mixtures drive the temporal dynamics of understorey productivity, functional diversity and composition through canopy packing (CP). 3. Tree mixtures with high functional diversity experienced increased CP over time, thereby decreasing understorey productivity and diversity. Furthermore, herbaceous communities were dominated by species with functional traits typical of low-light conditions [lower community-weighted mean (CWM) of maximum plant height, but larger CWM of specific leaf area] in response to increased CP. 4. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the role of tree functional diversity in shaping the dynamics of biomass, functional diversity and composition of the understorey herbaceous layer during the early successional period. It is expected that the effects of tree functional diversity would also be relevant over time due to the increasing usage of canopy space. This study highlights the significance of natural community processes in determining the effects of tree diversity on the temporal dynamics of previously neglected ecosystem structures and functioning.","[Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Bao, Di-Feng; Xu, Ming-Shan; Yang, Bai-Yu; Zhao, Zhao; Zhang, Li; Yan, En-Rong] Inst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

Multiple assembly processes, including abiotic filtering, competition and multi-trophic relationships, operate simultaneously to structure FD. In water-limited plant communities, FD is likely to reflect trade-offs between drought resistance vs. disturbance resistance and competitive ability. We propose a mathematical mechanistic model for understanding the organization and function of water-limited plant communities. The approach captures the interplay between abiotic filtering, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance. We exploit this powerful model to uncover mechanisms underlying changes in functional diversity along stress gradients. Our approach links biomass production and FD to environmental conditions through plant resource capture ability. Functional groups are defined along a single trade-off axis according to investment in capturing light (shoot) vs. water (root). Species growth rate is determined dynamically by the species traits, water availability and grazing stress. We derive biomass production, functional diversity and composition along precipitation and grazing gradients. Model's results revealed several regimes structuring FD along the precipitation gradient: Struggle for water' at low precipitation, competition for water' at intermediate precipitation and competition for light' at high precipitation. We observed a shift in grazing effect on FD from negative at very low precipitation, to positive at higher precipitation. Unimodal FD-grazing intensity relationship was observed under high precipitation, while under low precipitation, FD decreased moderately with increasing grazing intensity.Synthesis. Our model showcases how fundamental tradeoffs in plant traits may drive functional diversity and ecosystem function along environmental gradients. It offers a mechanism through which novel understandings can be obtained regarding the interplay between water stress, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance intensity and history. We discuss further model testing possibilities as well as required empirical work.","[Nathan, Jonathan; Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Volcani Ctr, ARO, Dept Nat Resources, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University,"Meron, E (autor correspondente), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.;Meron, E (autor correspondente), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Phys, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, Israel.",meron@bgu.ac.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science Foundation [861/09],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"This research has been supported by the Israel Science Foundation, Grant no. 861/09.",NA,87,26,29,8,143,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

In this study, we applied a step-wise modeling procedure to test the relative effects of taxonomic diversity, functional identity, and functional diversity on macrophytes community productivity along water depth gradient. We sampled 42 plots and 1513 individual plants and measured 16 functional traits and abundance of 17 macrophyte species. Results showed that there was a significant decrease in taxonomic diversity, functional identity (i.e., stem dry mass content, leaf [C] and leaf [N]), and functional diversity (i.e., floating leaf, mean Julian flowering date and rooting depth) with increasing water depth. For the multiple-trait functional diversity (FD) indices, functional richness decreased, while functional divergence increased with water depth gradient. Macrophyte community productivity was strongly determined by functional trait composition within community, but not significantly affected by taxonomic diversity. Community-weighted means (CWM) showed a two times higher explanatory power relative to FD indices in determining variations in community productivity. For nine of sixteen traits, CWM and FD showed significant correlations with community productivity, although the strength and direction of those relations depended on selected trait. Furthermore, functional composition in a community affected productivity through either additive or opposite effects of CWM and FD, depending on the particular traits being considered. Our results suggested both mechanisms of mass ratio and niche complementarity can operate simultaneously on variations in community productivity, and considering both CWM and FD would lead to a more profound understanding of traits-productivity relationships.","[Fu, Hui; Zhong, Jiayou; Yuan, Guixiang] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Nanchang 330029, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Ni, Leyi; Xie, Ping; Cao, Te] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Donghu Expt Stn Lake Ecosyst, Wuhan 430027, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS","Zhong, JY (autor correspondente), Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Nanchang 330029, Peoples R China.",jiayou@jxsl.gov.cn; caote@ihb.ac.cn,"Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020",,"National Science Foundation of China [31300398, 31270508, 41230853]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2012ZX07105-004]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China),"This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31300398, 31270508, 41230853) and the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2012ZX07105-004).",NA,34,58,68,9,137,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The spatial stability of plant biomass is important, and the mechanisms regulating plant biomass spatial variability in variable environments are a central focus of ecology. However, they have rarely been explored. We conducted an experiment to test how diversity and functional traits affected variation in biomass and community response to nutrient availability in three plant communities: natural; forb, legume, and bunchgrass; and rhizomatous grass. We found that biomass stability rarely changed with increasing taxonomic species richness and functional group richness but declined with increasing Shannon-Weiner indices (the combination of richness and evenness) and functional trait diversity. However, differences in plant species composition generated different responses in both the amount and spatial variation of biomass following nutrient addition. Because rhizomatous grasses are weakly competitive in nutrient-poor conditions, interaction between resource-acquisitive (grass) and stress-tolerant (forb) species in the natural community conferred the greatest overall stability. The rapid nutrient acquisition ability of the rhizomatous grass Leymus chinensis was stimulated in nutrient-abundant conditions. The functional traits of this dominant species overrode the diversity interaction effects of the natural and forb, legume, and bunchgrass communities. This ultimately resulted in the rhizomatous grass community being the most stable. Community stability was strongly determined by a few key species, particularly rhizomatous grasses, rather than by the average response of all species, thereby supporting the mass ratio hypothesis. Our results indicated that rhizomatous grasses could provide vegetative productivity to reduce soil loss and prevent degradation of L. chinensis-dominant grassland. Thus, protecting specific species is critical for maintaining rangeland ecosystem functions. Moreover, the conservation importance of grasses, non-leguminous forbs, legumes, or even rare species could not be ignored. Maintaining stability mechanisms in natural grasslands is complex, and therefore, further studies need to focus on finding a unified mechanism that can regulate appreciable biomass variation under shifting environmental conditions.","[Zhao, Na] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Adaptat & Evolut Plateau Biota, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Na; Shao, Xinqing; Wang, Kun] China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chao] Beijing Res & Dev Ctr Grass & Environm, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jiangwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Agricultural University; Beijing Academy of Agriculture & Forestry Sciences (BAAFS); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Wang, K (autor correspondente), China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",wangkun@cau.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [31402120]; National Key Basic Research Development Project [2006AA10Z250]; Science and Technology Project in QingHai Province [2019-0204-NCC-0033, 2018-S-2, 2018-NK-A2]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Basic Research Development Project(National Basic Research Program of China); Science and Technology Project in QingHai Province,"The research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (31402120), the National Key Basic Research Development Project (2006AA10Z250) and Science and Technology Project in QingHai Province (2019-0204-NCC-0033), (2018-S-2), (2018-NK-A2).

Meanwhile, biodiversity is known to modulate ecosystem functions. Numerous studies have focused on the links between aboveground productivity and plant diversity, while the potential influence of root traits on fine root biomass (FRB) has barely been elucidated. Therefore, it remains unclear how groundwater, soil, species diversity, above- and belowground traits jointly regulate FRB. Methods 230 plots were sampled under a broad range of groundwater and soil conditions across a typical arid inland river basin, within which FRB, associated soil properties, species diversity and functional traits were measured. Results FRB was mainly regulated by the interactions between groundwater and root trait diversity, followed by groundwater, root trait diversity and soil moisture. Although mean and seasonality of groundwater depth had substantial effects on FRB, groundwater affected FRB mainly through indirect pathways mediated by root trait diversity. Furthermore, root trait diversity showed the largest direct effect on FRB, suggesting that it was the main driver of FRB. Species richness and aboveground traits had no significant direct effect on FRB, implying that root traits surpassed species richness and aboveground traits in regulating FRB. Conclusion Our findings provide robust empirical evidence that groundwater and root trait diversity jointly drive existing belowground carbon storage in arid inland river basin. We emphasize the importance of groundwater and root trait diversity, as well as their interactions in forecasting underground ecological processes and functions under global changes.","[Wang, Yin; Wang, Jian-Ming; Yang, Huan; Li, Guan-Jun; Li, Jing-Wen] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yin; Wang, Jian-Ming; Yang, Huan; Li, Guan-Jun; Li, Jing-Wen] Beijing Forestry Univ, Ejina Inst Populus Euphrat, Alxa 750300, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chen] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University,"Li, JW (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Li, JW (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Ejina Inst Populus Euphrat, Alxa 750300, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China.",Lijingwenhy@bjfu.edu.cn,,"wang, yin/0000-0001-8139-2285",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31971538],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank all the following people for their help.

As plant traits have been linked to both AB and ecosystem success, they may provide a useful approach to understand the changes in individual plants and grassland productivity in response to grazing on a generic level. Unfortunately, the current lack of studies on how plant traits affect AB affected by herbivores leaves a major gap in our understanding of the mechanism of grassland productivity decline. This study, therefore, aims to analyze the paths of overgrazing-induced decline in the individual AB of Leymus chinensis (the dominant species of meadow-steppe grassland in northern China) on a plant functional trait scale. Using a paired-sampling approach, we compared the differences in the functional traits of L. chinensis in long-term grazing-excluded and experimental grazing grassland plots over a continuous period of approximately 20 years (located in meadow steppe lands in Hailar, Inner Mongolia, China). We found a highly significant decline in the individual height and biomass (leaf, stem, and the whole plant) of L. chinensis as a result of overgrazing. Biomass allocation and leaf mass per unit area were significantly affected by the variation in individual size. Grazing clearly enhanced the sensitivity of the leaf-to-stem biomass ratio in response to variation in individual size. Moreover, using a method of standardized major axis estimation, we found that the biomass in the leaves, stems, and the plant as a whole had highly significant allometric scaling with various functional traits. Also, the slopes of the allometric equations of these relationships were significantly altered by grazing. Therefore, a clear implication of this is that grazing promotes an asymmetrical response of different plant functional traits to variation in individual plant size, which influences biomass indirectly. Furthermore, we detected paths of individual AB decline in L. chinensis induced by grazing by fitting to a structural equation model. These results indicate that grazing causes AB decline primarily through a 'bottomup' effect on plant height and stem traits. However, leaf traits, via the process of allometric scaling, affect plant AB indirectly.","[Li, Xiliang; Liu, Zhiying; Wang, Zhen; Wu, Xinhong; Hu, Jing; Shi, Hongxiao; Guo, Fenghui; Zhang, Yong; Hou, Xiangyang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Minist Agr, Key Lab Grassland Resources & Utilizat, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiliang; Liu, Zhiying; Hu, Jing; Guo, Fenghui] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinle] China Acad Forestry, Expt Ctr Desert Forestry, Dengkou, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Graduate School, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Forestry","Hou, XY (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Minist Agr, Key Lab Grassland Resources & Utilizat, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",houxy16@126.com,,,National Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2014CB138800]; International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of China [2012DFA31290]; Central Non-profit Research Institutes Fundamental Research Funds of China [1610332015020]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of china [2014BS0328],National Key Basic Research Development Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of China; Central Non-profit Research Institutes Fundamental Research Funds of China; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of china,"This study was financially supported by the National Key Basic Research Development Program of China (2014CB138800), the International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of China (2012DFA31290), Central Non-profit Research Institutes Fundamental Research Funds of China (1610332015020) and Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of china (2014BS0328).

There is a growing consensus that the distribution of species trait values in a community can greatly determine ecosystem processes and services delivery. Two distinct components of community trait composition are hypothesized to chiefly affect ecosystem processes: (i) the average trait value of the species, quantified by community-weighted mean trait values (CWM; related to the mass ratio hypothesis) and (ii) the degree to which trait values differ between species in a community, quantified by different indices of functional diversity (FD; related to non-additive community effects). The uncertainty on the relative effect of these two components is stimulating an increasing number of empirical studies testing their effects on ecosystem processes and services delivery. 2. We suggest, however, that the interdependence between CWM and FD poses a challenge on disentangling their relative importance. We present a framework that allows designing experiments to decouple and assess the effects of these two community functional components on ecosystem processes and services. To illustrate the framework, we focused on leaf litter decomposition, as this is an essential process related to important ecosystem services. Using simulations, we applied the framework for plant leaf litter traits (litter nitrogen and phenolic content) that are related to litter decomposition. 3. CWM and FD generally showed a hump-shaped relationship (i. e. at more extreme CWM values, communities can have only low FD values). Within this relationship, we showed that it is possible to select quasi-orthogonal combinations of CWM and FD that can be treated statistically. Within these orthogonal CWM and FD combinations, it is also possible to select species assemblages controlling for other community parameters, such as total biomass, total density and species richness. 4. Synthesis. The framework provides a novel approach for designing experiments to decouple the effects of CWM and FD of communities on ecosystem processes, which otherwise cannot be easily disentangled. To apply the framework and design proper experimental layouts, it is essential to have a priori knowledge of the key traits by which species affect ecosystem processes and service delivery.","[Dias, Andre T.

Although it is possible to predict species richness (SR) patterns along environmental gradients, whether functional diversity (FD) changes in predictable ways is not known. In arid environments, SR typically increases with rainfall. Aridity may limit functional differentiation by allowing only certain traits, but could also be associated with diverse traits associated with various strategies for coping with spatial and temporal variation in resources. Rare species may have unique traits, making them particularly important to continued ecosystem function. We investigated SR, FD, and functional differentiation in bird assemblages along an aridity gradient, with attention to functional uniqueness of rare species. We surveyed bird communities in open savanna, bush-thickened, and riparian habitats at five sites of increasing aridity (similar to 150-400 mm rainfall year(-1)) in wet and dry seasons for 3 years in Namibia. We calculated the standardized effect size of FD (sesFD) as a measure of functional differentiation and used mixed models to ascertain how SR, FD, and sesFD relate to rainfall, season, and habitat type. SR and FD increased with increasing rainfall. Conversely, sesFD declined with increasing rainfall and was lower in woody habitats, suggesting habitat filtering and greater niche overlap. Rare species were more functionally unique than common species, in all three habitats, so loss of rare species could degrade ecosystem function. Our results are consistent with a linear diversity-productivity relationship maintained by regular disturbance (drought) preventing strong competitors from excluding weaker competitors in higher productivity environments.","[Seymour, Colleen L.] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa; [Seymour, Colleen L.; Simmons, Robert E.; Joseph, Grant S.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy Fitzpatrick Inst African Ornithol, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Slingsby, Jasper A.] South African Environm Observat Network SAEON, Fynbos Node, ZA-7735 Newlands, South Africa; [Slingsby, Jasper A.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",South African National Biodiversity Institute; National Research Foundation - South Africa; University of Cape Town; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); University of Cape Town,"Seymour, CL (autor correspondente), South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, Private Bag X7, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa.",c.seymour@sanbi.org.za,"Simmons, Robert E/AAE-3915-2020; Slingsby, Jasper/AAU-7259-2021","Slingsby, Jasper/0000-0003-1246-1181; Simmons, Robert/0000-0003-4964-8126; Seymour, Colleen/0000-0002-6729-2576",,,,NA,83,43,45,3,99,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,SEP,2015,18,6,,,,NA,971,984,,10.1007/s10021-015-9875-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9875-8,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CQ3ZI,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000360543100004,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), we measured traits on plants grown as solitary individuals, in monocultures or in mixtures. We calculated two measures of community-level trait composition, i.e., community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy; FD) based on different contexts in which traits were measured (trait origins). CWM and FD values of the different measurement origins were then compared regarding their power to predict community biomass production and biodiversity effects quantified with the additive partitioning method. Irrespective of trait origin, models combining CWM and FD values as predictors best explained community biomass and biodiversity effects. CWM values based on monoculture, mixture-mean or community-specific trait data were similarly powerful predictors, but predictions became worse when trait values originated from solitary-grown individuals. FD values based on monoculture traits were the best predictors of community biomass and net biodiversity effects, while FD values based on community-specific traits were the best predictors for complementarity and selection effects. Traits chosen as best CWM predictors were not strongly affected by trait origin but traits chosen as best FD predictors varied strongly dependent on trait origin and altered the predictability of community performance. We conclude that by adjusting their functional traits to species richness and even specific community compositions, plants can change community-level trait compositions, thereby also changing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Incorporation of these plastic trait adjustments of plants in trait-based ecology can improve its predictive power in explaining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.","[Roscher, Christiane] UFZ, Physiol Divers, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane; Weigelt, Alexandra] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Math, Ernst Abbe Pl 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Gubsch, Marlen; Buchmann, Nina] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lipowsky, Annett; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich Basel Plant Sci Ctr, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lipowsky, Annett; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, POB 100164, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Dept Special Bot & Funct Biodivers, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich; Max Planck Society; Leipzig University,"Roscher, C (autor correspondente), UFZ, Physiol Divers, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;Roscher, C (autor correspondente), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",christiane.roscher@ufz.de,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219",German Research Foundation - University of Jena [FOR 456/1451]; Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry,German Research Foundation - University of Jena; Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry,"The Jena Experiment is funded by the German Research Foundation (FOR 456/1451), supported by the University of Jena and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.

However, the design of cropping systems including cover plants relies largely on expert knowledge. There is a lack of methods to select the best suited cover plants according to their role in the agrosystem. We propose to use functional traits to select cover plants suited to sustain ecological services in the banana agrosystems of the French West Indies. Our objectives were (i) to characterize a collection of cover plants on a trait basis, according to their potential to provide the services expected in a banana agrosystem and (ii) to discuss the potential use of this characterization for the design of innovative multi-species banana cropping systems. In these systems, four main services are targeted, i.e. controlling weeds, controlling plant-parasitic nematodes, improving soil fertility. and particularly N availability, and avoiding competition with banana for resource acquisition. Three experiments were conducted, under field and controlled conditions, to evaluate the potential of a collection of 28 tropical cover plants to achieve the functions related to these services. For each cover plant, a functional profile was constructed from a combination of plant traits that are easy to assess experimentally. It described plants' potential to achieve the functions expected in a banana agrosystem. Functional profiles required for cover plant usages were also identified. The comparison of the plant functional profiles and the functional profiles required for their usages enabled us to select the best suited plants for each usage. However, these functional profiles rarely corresponded, meaning that a cover plant is rarely sufficient to achieve all the functions required for a usage. Functional complementarities obtained by the mixture of different species of cover plants are thus often required. Compared to classical approaches of innovative cropping system design based on the experimental testing of spatial and temporal plant combinations, such a trait-based approach saves time by focusing on a shortlist of cover plants best suited according to their functions in the agrosystem.

General mechanisms proposed to explain diversity effects include complementary resource use and invoke a key role for species' functional traits. The actual mechanisms by which complementary resource use occurs remain, however, poorly understood, as well as whether they apply to tree-dominated ecosystems. Here we present an experimental approach offering multiple innovative aspects to the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. The International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT) allows research to be conducted at several hierarchical levels within individuals, neighborhoods, and communities. The network investigates questions related to intraspecific trait variation, complementarity, and environmental stress. The goal of IDENT is to identify some of the mechanisms through which individuals and species interact to promote coexistence and the complementary use of resources. IDENT includes several implemented and planned sites in North America and Europe, and uses a replicated design of high-density tree plots of fixed species-richness levels varying in functional diversity (FD). The design reduces the space and time needed for trees to interact allowing a thorough set of mixtures varying over different diversity gradients (specific, functional, phylogenetic) and environmental conditions (e.g., water stress) to be tested in the field. The intention of this paper is to share the experience in designing FD-focused BEF experiments with trees, to favor collaborations and expand the network to different conditions.","[Tobner, Cornelia M.; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Ctr Ville Stn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW 2753, Australia; [Gravel, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gravel, Dominique] Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Ctr Ville Stn, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,,"Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",,,,NA,73,70,70,2,153,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2014,174,3,,,,NA,609,621,,10.1007/s00442-013-2815-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2815-4,NA,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AB7WS,24241640,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000332002300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its relative role compared with stand factors or functional identity is still controversial in natural forests. Here, we examined their relative effects on biomass and productivity during forest restoration. We investigated stand biomass and productivity for 24 plots (600 m(2)) across restoration stages in the subtropical forests of Mt. Shennongjia, Central China. We measured five key functional traits and calculated functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and dispersion) and community-weighted mean of traits. We used general linear models, variation partitioning methods to test the relative importance of stand factors (density, stand age, maximum height, etc.), functional identity, species and functional diversity on biomass and productivity. Our results illustrated that stand biomass and productivity increased significantly as forest restoration, and that community species richness increased, while functional dispersion decreased significantly. Variation partitioning analyses showed that diversity had no significant pure effects on biomass and productivity. However, diversity may affect biomass and productivity through the joint effect with stand factors and functional identity. Overall, we found that stand factors had the strongest effect on biomass and productivity, while functional identity significantly affects productivity but not biomass, suggesting that modulating stand structure and species identity are effective ways to enhance forest carbon storage and sequestrations potential in forest management.","[Miao, Wenhao; Ma, Shupeng; Guo, Zhiwen; Sun, Haozhe; Wang, Xuemei; Lyu, Yueming; Wang, Xiangping] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Wang, XP (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wangxiangping@bjfu.edu.cn,"Sun, Haozhe/GPF-8964-2022; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Wang, Xuemei/GXF-3702-2022","Sun, Haozhe/0000-0002-3625-2870; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870430]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0503901, 2016YFC0502104]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870430) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0503901, 2016YFC0502104).",NA,74,6,6,10,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

The aim of this study was to analyze the relation between vegetation production and soil C stocks for a set of seven temperate grasslands of various productivity levels. We estimated vegetation production directly through measurements of aboveground biomass (>5 cm), stubble and root biomass, and indirectly via plant community functioning. Soil C stocks were measured for bulk soil (organic C, SOC) and hot-water-extractable C (HWC) of topsoil. Plant community functioning was characterized by community-weighted mean ((CWM)) traits and functional diversity index. Results show a negative relation between biomass production and SOC(stock.)The tradeoff between productivity and SOC(stock)could be linked to plant community functioning and particularly Leaf Dry Matter content (LDMCCWM) which appeared to be the most relevant descriptor of plant community functioning. High SOC(stock)could be associated to low productivity, conservative strategy (high LDMCCWM), low soil labile C content and grassland age. Our results show a strong direct effect of management and grassland age on plant community, which in turn affects plant tissue quality and subsequent organic matter mineralization. Old permanent grasslands appeared less productive but represent an occasion for C storage and thus global change mitigation.","[Kohler, Caroline; Morvan-Bertrand, Annette; Cliquet, Jean-Bernard; Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Inst Biol Fondamentale & Appl IBFA, INRAE,EVA,Fed Normandie Vegetale 4277, F-14000 Caen, France; [Klumpp, Katja] UCA, INRAE, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",INRAE; Universite de Caen Normandie; INRAE; VetAgro Sup,"Lemauviel-Lavenant, S (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Inst Biol Fondamentale & Appl IBFA, INRAE,EVA,Fed Normandie Vegetale 4277, F-14000 Caen, France.",caroline@kohler.bio; annette.bertrand@unicaen.fr; jean-bernard.cliquet@unicaen.fr; katja.klumpp@inra.fr; servane.lavenant@unicaen.fr,"Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane/AHE-2202-2022","Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane/0000-0003-0176-6318; Morvan-Bertrand, Annette/0000-0002-7802-6943; Katja, Klumpp/0000-0002-4799-5231",Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie,Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie(Region Normandie),This work was supported by the Conseil Regional de Basse-Normandie.,NA,75,4,4,5,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4395,,AGRONOMY-BASEL,Agronomy-Basel,JUL,2020,10,7,,NA,,NA,,,1024,10.3390/agronomy10071024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10071024,NA,,18,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,MW7AP,NA,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000557185000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,Davi,sim,,sim,,não,grassland,temperate,negativa,SLA;LDMC;LCC;LNC;LC:N,NA,NA,ns,negativa,NA,ns,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,negativa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,ns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plant communities in natural ecosystems are changing and species are being lost due to anthropogenic impacts including global warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. We removed dominant species, combinations of species and entire functional types from Alaskan tussock tundra, in the presence and absence of fertilization, to examine the effects of non-random species loss on plant interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. After 6 years, growth of remaining species had compensated for biomass loss due to removal in all treatments except the combined removal of moss, Betula nana and Ledum palustre (MBL), which removed the most biomass. Total vascular plant production returned to control levels in all removal treatments, including MBL. Inorganic soil nutrient availability, as indexed by resins, returned to control levels in all unfertilized removal treatments, except MBL. 3. Although biomass compensation occurred, the species that provided most of the compensating biomass in any given treatment were not from the same functional type (growth form) as the removed species. This provides empirical evidence that functional types based on effect traits are not the same as functional types based on response to perturbation. Calculations based on redistributing N from the removed species to the remaining species suggested that dominant species from other functional types contributed most of the compensatory biomass. 4. Fertilization did not increase total plant community biomass, because increases in graminoid and deciduous shrub biomass were offset by decreases in evergreen shrub, moss and lichen biomass. Fertilization greatly increased inorganic soil nutrient availability. 5. In fertilized removal treatments, deciduous shrubs and graminoids grew more than expected based on their performance in the fertilized intact community, while evergreen shrubs, mosses and lichens all grew less than expected. Deciduous shrubs performed better than graminoids when B. nana was present, but not when it had been removed. 6. Synthesis. Terrestrial ecosystem response to warmer temperatures and greater nutrient availability in the Arctic may result in vegetative stable-states dominated by either deciduous shrubs or graminoids. The current relative abundance of these dominant growth forms may serve as a predictor for future vegetation composition.","[Bret-Harte, M. Syndonia; Sloan, Daniel B.; Chapin, F.

However, few studies have identified traits that both respond to environmental change and affect ecosystem properties, thus limiting potential to scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. We measured canopy and understory plant functional traits, characterizing the most abundant functional trait value (community-weighted mean; CWM) and the functional diversity (FD), across a soil resource gradient in fire-managed mixed-deciduous forests to determine how traits both respond to a disturbance-resource gradient and affect stocks of active and stable soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions. We expected that understory traits would respond mainly to fire and canopy traits would respond mainly to soil resources. We further hypothesized that fire and resource conditions affect SOC stocks (1) through mass-ratio, by influencing trait abundance; (2) through non-additive effects, by influencing the FD of plant communities; or (3) directly, through either combustion or environmental controls on SOC stocks. Understory traits responded to soil resource conditions and fire, whereas only canopy CWM leaf dry matter content (LDMC) varied with resource conditions; no canopy traits varied with fire. Among the response traits, canopy CWM LDMC and diversity in the maximum height of the understory were related to SOC stocks, suggesting they play dual roles as response and effect traits. SOC stocks were primarily associated with mass-ratio effects from canopy leaf traits and secondarily with non-additive effects from the canopy and understory. There were also strong, fraction-dependent patterns in SOC stocks with fire disturbance. Repeatedly burned forests characterized by resource conservative traits (i.e., high canopy CWM LDMC) had a higher relative proportion of active SOC, whereas unburned forests characterized by resource acquisitive traits (i.e., high canopy CWM leaf nitrogen content) had a higher relative proportion of stable SOC. Our results suggest that canopy community-aggregated leaf traits and diversity in understory size traits can act as both response and effect traits in disturbed forests. Predicting forest SOC stocks using a response-effect trait framework will thus require knowledge of both canopy and understory trait distributions, as well as disturbance history.","[Refsland, Tyler K.; Fraterrigo, Jennifer M.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Fraterrigo, Jennifer M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Refsland, TK (autor correspondente), Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",refslan2@illinois.edu,"Refsland, Tyler/ABF-4075-2021; Refsland, Tyler K/ABF-4073-2021","Refsland, Tyler/0000-0002-7210-9174",USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program [875-303],USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program,This study was supported by the USDA McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Program Project Number 875-303.

However, related patterns and underlying mechanisms have rarely been examined, especially lacking long-term evidence. We conducted a factorial crossed sample survey to examine the effects of plant diversity on soil stability over succession based on space-for-time substitution in the Songnen Steppes, North-Eastern China. The results indicate that, under natural colonizing conditions, species-poor systems achieved lower soil stability than species-rich systems, regardless of successional stage. However, soil stability was significantly regulated by plant species richness (number), composition (identity), density (abundance), and functional roles. Our results confirm that a long-term positive plant diversity-soil stability relationship exists in steppe succession. In particular, this enhanced effect of biodiversity on soil stability may operate via diversifying plant root traits. Our results may underpin an integrated biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, and improve human use and conservation management of natural resources at an integrated ecosystem level.","[Hu, Liang-Jun; Li, Ping] NE Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Vegetat Ecol Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qinfeng] USDA FS, Eastern Forest Environm Threat Assessment Ctr, Asheville, NC 28804 USA",Northeast Normal University - China; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Hu, LJ (autor correspondente), NE Normal Univ, MOE Key Lab Vegetat Ecol Sci, 5268 Renmin St,Life Sci Bldg, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",hulj068@gmail.com,,"Hu, Liang-Jun/0000-0002-3350-522X",Chinese National Natural Science Foundation [41071189]; Jilin Provincial Sci-Tech Cooperation [20090713]; Jilin Provincial Personnel Affairs Services Program for Selected Sci-Tech Innovation Activities by Chinese Returnees with Overseas Study Record; China Scholarship Council,Chinese National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jilin Provincial Sci-Tech Cooperation; Jilin Provincial Personnel Affairs Services Program for Selected Sci-Tech Innovation Activities by Chinese Returnees with Overseas Study Record; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This research was supported by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation Program (No. 41071189), the Jilin Provincial Sci-Tech Cooperation International Program (No. 20090713) and the Jilin Provincial Personnel Affairs Services Program for Selected Sci-Tech Innovation Activities by Chinese Returnees with Overseas Study Record.

We test how gradients of logging disturbance and soil properties relate to community-weighted mean traits in logged and old-growth tropical forests in Borneo. We studied 32 physical, chemical and physiological traits from 284 tree species in eight 1 ha plots and measured long-term soil nutrient supplies and plant-available nutrients. Logged plots had greater values for traits that drive carbon capture and growth, whilst old-growth forests had greater values for structural and persistence traits. Although disturbance was the primary driver of trait expression, soil nutrients explained a statistically independent axis of variation linked to leaf size and nutrient concentration. Soil characteristics influenced trait expression via nutrient availability, nutrient pools, and pH. Our finding, that traits have dissimilar responses to land use and soil resource availability, provides robust evidence for the need to consider the abiotic context of logging when predicting plant functional diversity across human-modified tropical forests. The detection of two independent axes was facilitated by the measurement of many more functional traits than have been examined in previous studies.","[Both, Sabine; Kuntz, Marianne; Mielke, Nora; Pillco, Milenka X.

Species richness is the most commonly used measure of biodiversity in such studies, but the range of species' functional traits (functional diversity), not the number of species per se, likely underpins a key mechanistic link between species richness and ecosystem functioning. However, the majority of experiments that have examined the effect of functional diversity have manipulated functional group richness, an approach recognised to suffer numerous limitations. Continuous measures of functional diversity avoid many of these limitations, but the relationship between continuous functional diversity and the magnitude of ecosystem processes has been largely untested. Using one vs two-species mixtures of rock pool macroalgae as a model, we conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of a continuous measure of functional diversity (functional attribute diversity, FAD, the degree of functional differentiation based on four functional traits) on the magnitude of net primary productivity and overyielding, based upon two alternative null-models. The total magnitude of productivity was largely determined by the identity of species present, not FAD. However, FAD proved to be a good predictor of overyielding (variation in productivity after the dominant effects of species identity had been accounted for). Furthermore, despite differences in the mean magnitude of the effect of combining species, the positive relationship between FAD and overyielding was consistent according to both additive and substitutive null-models. Our findings imply that whilst knowledge of species' independent contributions remains indispensable in the prediction of biotic effects on ecosystem functioning within a trophic level, continuous measures of functional diversity should be used as a supplementary tool to predict the magnitude of overyielding, thereby refining predictions.","[Griffin, John N.; Mendez, Veronica; Johnson, Andrew F.; Jenkins, Stuart R.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Foggo, Andy] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Johnson, Andrew F.; Jenkins, Stuart R.] Univ Wales Bangor, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales",Marine Biological Association United Kingdom; University of Plymouth; Bangor University,"Griffin, JN (autor correspondente), Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England.",john.griffin@plymouth.ac.uk,"Jenkins, Stuart R/D-2032-2010; Mendez, Veronica/N-7272-2015","Jenkins, Stuart R/0000-0002-2299-6318; Mendez, Veronica/0000-0001-9476-4666; Griffin, John/0000-0003-3295-6480","NERC [NE/B504649/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [MBA010001, NE/B504649/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [MBA010001] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),This work forms part of the PhD studentship of J.

Understanding the drivers of the ecosystem functions that support these services is therefore important. Much research has investigated how species richness influences functioning, but we lack knowledge of how other community attributes affect ecosystem functioning. Species evenness, species spatial arrangement, and the identity of dominant species are three attributes that could affect ecosystem functioning, by altering the relative abundance of functional traits and the probability of synergistic species interactions such as facilitation and complementary resource use. We tested the effect of these three community attributes and their interactions on ecosystem functions over a growing season, using model grassland communities consisting of three plant species from three functional groups: a grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), and a N-fixing forb (Lotus corniculatus). We measured multiple ecosystem functions that support ecosystem services, including ecosystem gas exchange, water retention, C and N loss in leachates, and plant biomass production. Species evenness and dominant species identity strongly influenced the ecosystem functions measured, but spatial arrangement had few effects. By the end of the growing season, evenness consistently enhanced ecosystem functioning and this effect occurred regardless of dominant species identity. The identity of the dominant species under which the highest level of functioning was attained varied across the growing season. Spatial arrangement had the weakest effect on functioning, but interacted with dominant species identity to affect some functions. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of multiple community attributes in driving ecosystem functioning.","[Orwin, Kate H.; Wilby, Andrew; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Orwin, Kate H.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Ostle, Nick] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Plant & Soil Biogeochem Grp, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England; [Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England",Lancaster University; Landcare Research - New Zealand; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); University of Manchester,"Orwin, KH (autor correspondente), Landcare Res, POB 40, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",orwink@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Wilby, Andrew/F-4618-2014; Ostle, Nicholas J/E-4847-2014","Wilby, Andrew/0000-0001-9984-4956; Ostle, Nicholas J/0000-0003-3263-3702; Orwin, Kate/0000-0003-0906-728X","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I008969/1, BB/I008969/2, BB/D523419/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010010] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRC [BB/I008969/1, BB/I008969/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/D523419/1] Funding Source: Medline",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),,NA,52,42,45,11,185,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2014,174,3,,,,NA,979,992,,10.1007/s00442-013-2814-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2814-5,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AB7WS,24213721,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000332002300033,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike our previous results, which were based on estimates of five plant functional attributes, the dominant species in this second community apparently are functionally no more dissimilar to each other than to all other species. We suggest that the lack of clear results in mixed life form communities represents a confounding of the relationships between the hard attributes that actually govern how a plant performs in an ecosystem and the soft attributes that we use as surrogates. There are very few data on the hard functional attributes of plant species and consequently little information on precisely how the (soft) measurable traits are related to their imputed functions. What evidence there is shows that although the relationships are strong within life forms, they differ between life forms. This poses a problem for the development of research relating plant biodiversity to ecosystem function. Until such a database is developed, it will be very difficult to advance our understanding and measurement of functional diversity in mixed life form communities.","CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Walker, BH (autor correspondente), CSIRO, GPO Box 284, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",bnan.walker@cse.csiro.au,"Walker, Brian H/F-2386-2011",,,,,NA,27,24,27,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,1435-0629,,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,SEP,2002,5,6,,,,NA,529,538,,10.1007/s10021-002-0154-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-002-0154-0,NA,,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,595QV,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000178121000002,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, a new perception of biodiversity as a major regulator of the functioning of ecosystems has emerged. The concept of biodiversity has a wide meaning and includes not only the number of species, but also the number of traits, relative species and trait abundances, etc. Understanding how these different components of biodiversity influence the functioning of communities is required in order to improve our ability to project the future consequences of the current rate of diversity loss. We used a short term manipulative experiment to disentangle the effects of species numbers, species traits (identity) and species relative abundance (evenness) on the primary productivity rates of intertidal macroalgal assemblages. We also examined the ability of functional identity and diversity indices to predict the magnitude of primary productivity and overyielding. Results suggested that the intense identity effects, derived from species traits, drove the response of the experimental assemblages. The relevance of species traits was confirmed by the significant effects of the community-level functional identity descriptors on the functioning of the assemblages. Also, weak but consistently positive effects were detected for evenness. Finally, the interaction between species richness and evenness suggested that the negative effect of high dominance by single species (i.e. low evenness) was more intense on those assemblages with reduced species richness. Thus, understanding potential interactions between richness, evenness and functional identity among other biodiversity components is critical to identify present and project future consequences of anthropogenic disturbances.","[Rodriguez, Sonia; Martin, Airam Prieto; Arenas, Francisco] Univ Porto, Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMAR, Aquat Ecol & Evolut Grp, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Rodriguez, Sonia; Sousa-Pinto, Isabel] Univ Porto, Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMAR, Coastal Biodivers Grp, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Sousa-Pinto, Isabel] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rua Campo Alegre S-N, P-4150181 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Arenas, F (autor correspondente), Univ Porto, Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMAR, Aquat Ecol & Evolut Grp, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal.",farenas@ciimar.up.pt,"Pinto, Isabel Sousa/W-1591-2019; Arenas, Francisco/M-7095-2015","Pinto, Isabel Sousa/0000-0002-9231-0553; Arenas, Francisco/0000-0001-6925-3805",Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [SFRH / BD /66791/2009]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade (POFC-COMPETE) within the Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional (QREN); ERDF [PEst-C/MAR/LA0015/2011]; project MarInfo - Integrated Platform for Marine Data Acquisition and Analysis [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000031]; North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/66791/2009] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade (POFC-COMPETE) within the Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional (QREN); ERDF(European Commission); project MarInfo - Integrated Platform for Marine Data Acquisition and Analysis; North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE) under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,"We are grateful to S.

Mechanistically understanding how their ecosystem functioning relates to biodiversity is necessary for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss and for setting conservation priorities. Here, we test whether carbon stocks in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in China are more strongly influenced by plant functional diversity (FD), as would be predicted by the 'niche complementarity hypothesis', or by community-weighted mean (CWM) functional trait values, as would be predicted by the 'mass ratio hypothesis'. Using data from a 24-ha plot subdivided into 400 m(2) quadrats, we determined relationships of aboveground carbon (AGC) and topsoil (1-10 cm) organic carbon (SOC) to topographic variables, stem density, CWM and FD of six functional traits hypothesized to influence carbon stocks. After accounting for topographic variables and tree stem density, boosted regression tree models revealed that CWMs were the dominant driving factors for both AGC and SOC, whereas FD had negligible effects. AGC and SOC were influenced by different functional traits, with AGC responding most strongly to CWM values for wood density and maximum tree height, and SOC responding most strongly to elevation, indicating that these carbon stocks are shaped by different underlying mechanisms. Our results support the mass ratio hypothesis but not the niche complementarity hypothesis. Our study implies that, when it comes to maximizing forest carbon storage, conservation priorities should focus on protection of species with traits associated to high carbon stocks.","[Lin, Dunmei] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm 3, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dunmei; Lai, Jiangshan; Mi, Xiangcheng; Ren, Haibao; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dunmei] Chongqing Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Low Carbon & Green Buildings, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Front Royal, VA USA; [Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ctr Trop Forest Sci Forest Global Earth Observ, Panama City, Panama","Chongqing University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chongqing University; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute","Ma, KP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Lin, DM (autor correspondente), Chongqing Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Low Carbon & Green Buildings, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China.",lindunmei@cqu.edu.cn; kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Lai, Jiangshan/HMP-3513-2023; Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J./U-6075-2019","Teixeira, Kristina/0000-0001-8461-9713; Lin, Dunmei/0000-0001-6112-7783","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31270496]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [106112015CDJXY210012]; 111 Project [B13041]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1545761, 1354741] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO.31270496), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (106112015CDJXY210012) and the 111 Project (B13041).",NA,63,39,46,8,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,DEC,2016,409,1-fev.,,,,NA,435,446,,10.1007/s11104-016-2976-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-2976-0,NA,,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,EF0RZ,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000390034900030,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the evolution of such strategies modifies ecosystem functioning and services is still not well understood. In the present work, we aim at understanding how the evolution of different phenotypic traits link aboveground and belowground processes, thereby affecting the functioning of the ecosystem at different scales and in different realms. Using a simple model, we follow the dynamics of a limiting nutrient inside an ecosystem. Considering trade-offs between aboveground and belowground functional traits, we study the effects of the evolution of such strategies on ecosystem properties (amount of mineral nutrient, total plant biomass, dead organic matter, and primary productivity) and whether such properties are maximized. Our results show that when evolution leads to a stable outcome, it minimizes the quantity of nutrient available (following Tilman's R* rule). We also show that considering the evolution of aboveground and belowground functional traits simultaneously, total plant biomass and primary productivity are not necessarily maximized through evolution. The coupling of aboveground and belowground processes through evolution may largely diminish predicted standing biomass and productivity (extinction may even occur) and impact the evolutionary resilience (i.e., the return time to previous phenotypic states) of the ecosystem in the face of external disturbances. We show that changes in plant biomass and their effects on evolutionary change can be understood by accounting for the links between nutrient uptake and mineralization, and for indirect effects of nutrient uptake on the amount of detritus in the system.","[Loeuille, Nicolas; Le Mao, Tiphaine; Barot, Sebastien] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS,IRD,INRA,Inst Ecol & Environm Sci,UMR7618, 7 Quai St Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Loeuille, N (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS,IRD,INRA,Inst Ecol & Environm Sci,UMR7618, 7 Quai St Bernard, F-75005 Paris, France.",nicolas.loeuille@upmc.fr,"barot, sébastien/A-8447-2012","barot, sébastien/0000-0002-5910-538X",French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA); CNRS; IRD,French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); IRD,The authors are very grateful to Dominique Gravel and Nicolas Gross for their helpful and constructive comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with 'harder' traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location: central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of 'soft' traits and 'hard' traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors ('hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.","UNC, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinary Biol Vegetal, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Nacl Cordoba, FCEF&N, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Unit Comparat Plant Ecol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Dept Syst Ecol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Tehran, Iran; CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Biodiversidad, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, E-50080 Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Sheffield, Dept Archaeol & Prehist, Sheffield S1 4ET, S Yorkshire, England; Inst Bot Barcelona, Barcelona 08038, Spain",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba; National University of Cordoba; University of Sheffield; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE); University of Sheffield; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut Botanic de Barcelona (ICUB),"Diaz, S (autor correspondente), UNC, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinary Biol Vegetal, Casilla Correo 495,Velez Sarsfield 299, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",sdiaz@com.uncor.edu,"Asri, Younes/V-2356-2017; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/L-1380-2014; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Shirvany, Anoushirvan/AFK-1292-2022; Azimi, Rouhangiz/B-2006-2018; Jalili, Adel/G-6487-2017; Shirvany, Anoushirvan/AAF-8500-2022; Perez-Rontome, Carmen/K-7672-2014; Castro-Diez, Pilar/L-4716-2014; Siavash, Bita/U-6675-2019; Hamzehee, Behnam/C-1646-2017; Shirvany, Anoushirvan/V-3714-2018; Asri, Younes/AAR-5494-2021","Asri, Younes/0000-0002-4566-1756; Villar-Salvador, Pedro/0000-0001-9338-4530; Shirvany, Anoushirvan/0000-0001-9953-3779; Azimi, Rouhangiz/0000-0002-3903-7180; Shirvany, Anoushirvan/0000-0001-9953-3779; Perez-Rontome, Carmen/0000-0002-9772-3170; Castro-Diez, Pilar/0000-0002-4841-5198; Hamzehee, Behnam/0000-0001-9642-1018; Asri, Younes/0000-0002-4566-1756; Guerrero-Campo, Joaquin/0000-0002-8702-8561; Romo, Angel/0000-0001-8135-8570; zarinkamar, fatemeh/0000-0002-2497-5131; Bogaard, Amy/0000-0002-6716-8890",,,,NA,65,1077,1176,24,943,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

This needs to be balanced with their potential negative impact on crop yield and quality. Mechanistic models of crop-weed competition are an important tool in striking this balance. A range of common UK annual weeds were screened for the eco-physiological traits required by the models. Using multivariate techniques, a number of functional groups with a similar pattern of productivity and competition were identified, based on trade-offs between traits. A scheme was developed to assign species outside of the data set to one of the groups, based on life cycle, seed mass, maximum height and time of first flowering. As well as having a similar competitive ability, species within a group also appeared to have a similar ecosystem function, in terms of supporting higher trophic groups. Two beneficial groups of species were identified that combined a relatively low competitive ability with a high importance for invertebrates and birds. The identification of functional groups in the UK arable flora is a useful tool for assessing a weed community in the context of reconciling biodiversity provision with crop production. Preserving beneficial plant functional types within the crop would complement non-cropped wildlife refuges, such as field margins.","Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research,"Storkey, J (corresponding author), Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",jonathan.storkey@bbsrc.ac.uk,,"Storkey, Jonathan/0000-0003-1094-8914",,,,NA,38,113,119,5,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0043-1737,1365-3180,,WEED RES,Weed Res.,DEC,2006,46,6,,NA,,NA,513,522,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2006.00528.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2006.00528.x,NA,,10,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,103WC,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000241916900009,View Full Record in Web of Science,Davi,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,crop_production,temperate,NA,NA,"initial_green_area_at_emergence_(L0);relative_growth_rate_of_green_area_in_the_autumn_(RGRLa);relative_growth_rate_of_green_area_in_the_spring_(RGRLs);mean_root_weight_ratio_(root

Using a globally applicable functional palaeocological approach, we provide a deeper understanding of fossil pollen-inferred long-term response of vegetation to past climatic disturbances based on changes in functional trait composition. Specifically, we show how and why the ecological strategies exhibited by vegetation have changed through time by linking observations of plant traits to multiple pollen records from southeast Australia to reconstruct past functional diversity (FD, the value and the range of species traits that influence ecosystem functioning). The drivers of FD changes were assessed quantitatively by comparing FD reconstructions to independent records of past climates. During the last 12,000 years, peaks in FD were associated with both dry and wet climates in southeast Australia, with shifts in leaf traits particularly pronounced under wet conditions. Continentality determined the degree of stability maintained by high FD, with the greatest seen on the mainland. We expect projected frequent drier conditions in southeast Australia over coming decades to drive changes in vegetation community functioning and productivity mirroring the functional palaeocological record, particularly in western Tasmania and western southeast mainland.","[Adeleye, Matthew Adesanya; Haberle, Simon Graeme; Herbert, Annika] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Culture, Hist & Language, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Adeleye, Matthew Adesanya; Haberle, Simon Graeme; Herbert, Annika] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Australian B, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Gallagher, Rachael] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW, Australia; [Andrew, Samuel Charles] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Western Sydney University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Adeleye, MA (autor correspondente), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Culture, Hist & Language, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Adeleye, MA (autor correspondente), Australian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Australian B, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",matthew.adeleye@anu.edu.au,"Andrew, Samuel/J-6739-2019","Andrew, Samuel/0000-0003-4589-2746; Herbert, Annika/0000-0001-9322-043X; Haberle, Simon/0000-0001-5802-6535; Gallagher, Rachael/0000-0002-4680-8115",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage support grant [CE170100015],Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage support grant(Australian Research Council),"We acknowledge the work of the data contributors to this study and pay our respect to the Indigenous peoples of SE Australia in whose land this study was conducted.

However, the relative importance of different facets of biodiversity underlying the diversity-stability relationship remains unclear. Here we use data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments and structural equation modelling to investigate the roles of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and both the diversity and community-weighted mean of functional traits representing the 'fast-slow' leaf economics spectrum in driving the diversity-stability relationship. We found that high species richness and phylogenetic diversity stabilize biomass production via enhanced asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Contrary to expectations, low phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem stability directly, albeit weakly. While the diversity of fast-slow functional traits has a weak effect on ecosystem stability, communities dominated by slow species enhance ecosystem stability by increasing mean biomass production relative to the standard deviation of biomass over time. Our in-depth, integrative assessment of factors influencing the diversity-stability relationship demonstrates a more multicausal relationship than has been previously acknowledged.","[Craven, Dylan; Eisenhauer, Nico; Roscher, Christiane; Hines, Jes; Kattge, Jens; Weigelt, Alexandra] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan; Eisenhauer, Nico; Hines, Jes; Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Craven, Dylan] Univ Gottingen, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Pearse, William D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Ecol & Biodivers Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Isbell, Forest; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [Bahn, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Ecol, Innsbruck, Austria; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany; [Boenisch, Gerhard; Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Byun, Chaeho] Yonsei Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Catford, Jane A.] Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Cerabolini, Bruno E.

Many studies have shown that a greater plant diversity can stabilize community productivity against environmental fluctuations. However, most of these studies focused on plant species richness, thus overlooking the potential role of functional traits in stabilizing community productivity against environmental fluctuations. Whether and how functional trait mean and variability influence community stability in response to environmental changes and their relative contributions to community stability are largely unknown. Here, we used a 10-year experiment to investigate the role of species richness, as well as functional mean and intra- and interspecific variability of specific leaf area (SLA) of plants within- and among communities in driving community stability in response to nitrogen (N) addition and warming. We found that both N addition and warming reduced the temporal stability of community productivity by reducing species richness and its contribution to species asynchrony and species stability. In contrast, changes in the mean and variability of SLA in response to N addition and warming mitigated the reduction of community stability. Specifically, N addition reduced variation in SLA both by reducing interspecific differences in SLA within communities and differences in mean values of SLA among communities. Warming increased intraspecific differences in SLA among communities, leading to higher species stability that partly buffered the reduction of community stability. Our study demonstrates the role of trait mean and variability in mitigating the reduction of community stability in response to two pervasive global environmental changes. Gaining a deeper understanding of the processes linking global changes and the stability of our ecosystems requires integrating both trait mean values and trait variability.","[Huang, Mengjiao; Nie, Ming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Sci, Natl Observat & Res Stn Shanghai Yangtze Estuarin, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Mengjiao; Nie, Ming] Fudan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shurong] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestr, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Utrecht, Netherlands",Fudan University; Fudan University; Peking University; Peking University; Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Hainan University; Utrecht University,"Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestr, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017; Nie, Ming/F-1880-2010; Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012","Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Nie, Ming/0000-0003-0702-8009; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31830009, 31770518]; Hainan University [RZ2000009932]; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University; Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31830009 and 31770518 to SZ) and and Hainan University (RZ2000009932 to SZ).

However, most studies on variations in plant functional traits and linkages to ecosystem function have focused on grazing or N enrichment alone. Few studies have combined these two factors to explore the role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly and primary productivity, and their pathways on ANPP remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of N addition and grazing on intra- and interspecific variations in plant functional traits in Inner Mongolia steppe based on two manipulative experiments with six N addition rates or grazing intensities over 6 years. The direct and indirect effects of N addition and grazing on ANPP were further analysed. Our results showed that N enrichment greatly enhanced intraspecific trait variability compared to grazing, which played an important role in maintaining species diversity and primary productivity. There was a negative linear relationship between species richness and intraspecific trait variance within community (T-IP/IC), indicating that N enrichment promoted intraspecific trait variability and increased interspecific niche width, leading to a decrease in species richness. ANPP was positively correlated with T-IP/IC values under N addition or grazing, suggesting that higher intraspecific trait variability was beneficial to maintaining grassland productivity. We also found that N addition had a direct positive effect on ANPP, and intraspecific trait variation was the secondary cause of ANPP variation; in contrast, grazing had an indirect negative effect on ANPP, mainly through species richness and interspecific trait variation. Synthesis and applications. Our findings have important implications for the restoration and management of semi-arid grasslands. Considering the offsetting effects of N addition and grazing on primary productivity, fertilization measures can be integrated into pasture management to quickly restore productivity. In the restoration of degraded grassland by artificial reseeding, the optimal seedling density related to intraspecific variation should be determined, and the forge species should be selected according to plant functional traits, taking into account the strategies of both conservative resource-use and grazing tolerance.","[Zheng, Shuxia; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chi, Yonggang] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaojing] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenhuai] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Lan, Zhichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Observat & Res Stn Wetland Ecosyst Lake Poyang, Lushan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Zhejiang Normal University; Shaanxi Normal University; Inner Mongolia University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Zheng, SX; Bai, YF (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zsx@ibcas.ac.cn; yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Li, Wenhuai/A-1268-2015","Li, Wenhuai/0000-0002-1113-2020; /0000-0002-3418-1992; Zheng, Shuxia/0000-0001-6818-3796","State Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671046, 32071883]; Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region [2020CG0055]",State Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,"This study was supported by the State Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604702), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671046, 32071883) and the Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (2020CG0055).",NA,53,4,4,58,163,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Functional diversity has been suggested as an important descriptor of an assemblage and as an indicator of ecosystem function. However, there has been little testing of recent functional diversity measures on field data and across environmental gradients of disturbance and productivity. This study tested how three recently developed measures of functional diversity behave in practice and what could be deduced about assembly rules operating in the systems studied. 2. Data from 30 plant communities in a small area, comprising arable fields, mown and grazed grasslands, moorland and woodland, were analysed in terms of these diversity indices. Functional Divergence, Evenness and Richness were independent of each other, but Richness correlated to species diversity through the sampling effect. 3. As evidenced by reduced Functional Richness, habitat filtering operated at a significant proportion of the sites sampled. Functional Richness was also reduced against expectations at high levels of both productivity and disturbance. Functional Divergence showed no clear patterns, but Functional Evenness showed a clear promotion by disturbance and a reduction at high standing biomass. 4. Synthesis. Knowledge of how functional diversity is related to the environment provides indications of the processes governing community assembly, and the possibility of developing them as measures of ecosystem function.","James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk,"Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015","Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133",,,,NA,37,151,157,9,179,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Few studies have examined how plant diversity impacts belowground processes; even fewer have examined how varying resource levels can influence the effect of plant diversity on microbial activity. In a field experiment in a restored wetland, we examined the role of plant trait diversity (or functional diversity, (FD)) and its interactions with natural levels of variability of soil properties, on a microbial process, denitrification potential (DNP). We demonstrated that FD significantly affected microbial DNP through its interactions with soil conditions; increasing FD led to increased DNP but mainly at higher levels of soil resources. Our results suggest that the effect of species diversity on ecosystem functioning may depend on environmental factors such as resource availability. Future biodiversity experiments should examine how natural levels of environmental variability impact the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning.","[Sutton-Grier, Ariana E.; Richardson, Curtis] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Wright, Justin P.; McGill, Bonnie M.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Sutton-Grier, AE (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",ariana.suttongrier@gmail.com,"Wright, Justin/AAG-6461-2019; McGill, Bonnie/AAT-7426-2020; Richardson, Curt/P-5905-2019; Richardson, Curtis J/A-8202-2009","Wright, Justin/0000-0002-9102-5347; McGill, Bonnie/0000-0002-5417-3519; Sutton-Grier, Ariana/0000-0002-1242-7728",National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0508763]; Association of University Women Educational Foundation; Society of Wetland Scientist Student Research Grant; Duke Wetlands Center Case Study Endowment; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Association of University Women Educational Foundation; Society of Wetland Scientist Student Research Grant; Duke Wetlands Center Case Study Endowment; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Smithsonian Environmental Research Center(Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Environmental Research Center),"This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant DEB0508763, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (http://www.nsfgrfp.org); an American Fellowship from the Association of University Women Educational Foundation (http://www.aauw.org/education/fga); a Society of Wetland Scientist Student Research Grant (http://www.sws.org/studentgrants); the Duke Wetlands Center Case Study Endowment (http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/wetland); and a grant from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov).

However, the relationships among soil properties, biodiversity, and leaf functional traits contributing to the variability in ecosystem iWUE and gs remain largely unknown. To elucidate these relationships, we used principal component analysis to reduce soil properties to a fertility spectrum and a limiting-resource spectrum across grassland, and early-, mid- and late-successional forests in a karst catchment. Leaf functional traits at community level were calculated based on leaf biomass, and were reduced to an economic spectrum and a limiting-resource spectrum. Leaf carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotopes at community levels were used as proxies for ecosystem iWUE and &The effects of soil properties, biodiversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) and leaf traits on delta C-13 and delta O-18 were evaluated using structural equation models. Our results showed that variability in ecosystem iWUE and gs was determined overwhelmingly by indirect effects of soil properties via two different pathways: the soil fertility spectrum, determining the number of coexisting species (taxonomic diversity) and turnover of species (leaf economic spectrum), and the soil limiting-resource spectrum, shaping the specific phylogenetic lineages (phylogenic diversity). In addition, delta C-13 and delta O-18 were constrained by the interactive effects of leaf economic spectrum, and taxonomic and phylogenic diversity; total effects of biodiversity on delta C-13 and delta O-18 were larger than those of leaf economic spectrum. Our study highlighted the critical role of the evaluating interaction relationships between leaf functional traits, biodiversity metrics and soil properties in understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem function responding to environmental change.

More recent studies have examined the interplay between these factors, but few such studies use an explicit trait-based framework. In this study, we use an explicit trait-based approach to identify potential mechanisms for community-level responses and to test ecological niche theory. We experimentally manipulated plant communities (control, -dominant species, -random biomass) and nitrogen (N) inputs (control, +organic N, +inorganic N) in a fully factorial design. We predicted that traits related to plants' ability to take up different forms of soil N would differ between dominant and subordinate species, resulting in interactive effects of dominant species loss and N fertilization on plant community structure and function. The study took place in a montane meadow in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. After four years, the plant community in removal plots converged toward a species composition whose leaf and root functional traits resembled those of the previously removed dominant species. Ecosystem productivity generally increased with N addition: soil carbon efflux was similar to 50% greater when either form of N was added, while inorganic N addition increased aboveground biomass production by similar to 60% relative to controls. The increase in production was mediated by increased average height, leaf mass:area ratio and leaf dry matter content in plant communities to which we added inorganic N. Contrary to our predictions, there were no interactive effects of N fertilization and dominant species loss on plant community structure or ecosystem function. The plant community composition in this study exhibited resistance to soil N addition and, given the functional convergence we observed, was resilient to species loss. Together, our results indicate that the ability of species to compensate functionally for species loss confers resilience and maintains diversity in montane meadow communities.","[Read, Quentin D.; Henning, Jeremiah A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Read, Quentin D.; Henning, Jeremiah A.; Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, POB 615, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Classen, Aimee T.; Sanders, Nathan J.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Copenhagen; University of Vermont,"Read, QD (autor correspondente), Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",qdr@msu.edu,"Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020; Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019; Classen, Aimee T/AAM-5671-2021; Nummer2, CMEC/HKE-1900-2023; Henning, Jeremiah A/Y-7466-2018; Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Henning, Jeremiah A/0000-0002-2214-4895; Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Tennessee; RMBL Dr Jean Langenheim Fellowship; RMBL Dr Lee R.

However, it remains unclear how multi-resource enrichment induces the effects of multifaceted biodiversity on grassland productivity under different site resource constraints. We conducted a multiple resource addition (MRA) ex-periment of water and nutrients at three sites located along a resource gradient in northern China. This allowed us to assess the response of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species (species richness and plant density), functional (functional richness and community-weighted mean of traits) and phylogenetic (phylogenetic richness) diversity to increasing number of MRA. We used structural equation model (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect effects of MRA and multifaceted biodiversity on ANPP. The combined addition of the four resources increased ANPP at all three sites. But with increasing number of MRA, biodiversity varied at the three sites. At the high resource constraint site, species richness, plant density and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) increased. At the medium resource con-straint site, plant height and LNC increased, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) decreased. At the low resource constraint site, species, functional and phylogenetic richness decreased, and height increased. The SEM showed that MRA in-creased ANPP directly at all three sites, and indirectly by increasing plant density at the high constraint site and height at the medium constraint site. Independent of MRA, ANPP was affected by height at the high resource constraint site and LNC at the low resource constraint site. Our results illustrate that multi-resource addition positively affects produc-tivity, while affects biodiversity depending on site resource constraint. The study highlights that site resource con-straint conditions need to be taken into consideration to better predict grassland structure and function, particularly under the future multifaceted global change scenarios.","[Guo, Xinxin; Zuo, Xiaoan; Guo, Aixia; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Qiao, Jingjuan; Li, Xiangyun; Chen, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinxin; Qiao, Jingjuan; Li, Xiangyun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Zhao, Xueyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Chen, Min] Key Lab Stress Physiol & Ecol Cold & Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; Natl Res Council IBE NRC, Inst BioEcon, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Wei, Cunzheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tian; Ke, Yuguang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Grassland Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la BioEconomia (IBE-CNR); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Beijing Forestry University","Zuo, XA (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",guoxinxin@lzb.ac.cn; zuoxa@lzb.ac.cn; yueping@lzb.ac.cn; zhaoxy@lzb.ac.cn; lixiangyun19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; weicunzheng@ibcas.ac.cn; yuq@bjfu.edu.cn,"Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011","Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623; Wei, Cunzheng/0000-0001-9309-2722",National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071140]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program [2019QZKK0305]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [E229880105]; Light of West China program CAS [E129050301],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Light of West China program CAS,"This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071140) , Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Re-search program (2019QZKK0305) , Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (E229880105) and Light of West China program CAS (E129050301) .",NA,65,0,0,64,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This information is increasingly used to optimize production systems that provide a wide range of ecosystem services. While agroforestry is actively promoted for the sustainable intensification of agriculture and restoration of degraded landscapes, there is a paucity of knowledge on Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) relationships in agroforestry systems. Since BEF-relationships in agroforestry might be shaped by combinations of different life-forms (e.g. trees, shrubs, herbs) and their interactions, experiences from grassland and forest experiments cannot be readily transferred to agroforestry. This highlights the need for a new type of experiments in agroforestry to advance our understanding of the role of biodiversity for the functioning of these systems. Therefore, our aim was to develop a conceptual framework for analysing BEF-relationships in agroforestry systems and to present an exemplary design for this purpose, which we placed in a (sub)tropical context. Based on designs used in tree diversity experiments, we suggest four major design principles: 1) a trait-based approach for selecting tree and crop species, 2) the integration of trees and crops along a gradient of functional diversity, 3) maintaining constant density across different combinations of life-forms in agroforests through the concept of growing-patch-density, and 4) disentangling a priori the effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning from those of structural and functional diversity, defined here as the variation in structural attributes such as plant dimensions and in plant functional traits, respectively. Our conceptual design and the embedded principles offer a promising avenue to identify important drivers of specific BEF-relationships and to quantify management influences on these. This design can support new research projects that aim at improving ecosystem functioning of agroforestry with the view of optimizing the provision of ecosystem services and facilitation of ecosystem restoration.

Previous studies suggest that removal of standing biomass by grazing decreases competition for light, but coincident grazing effects on competition for soil nutrients remain largely unknown in Tibetan rangelands where grazing tends to deplete soil phosphorus availability. We measured five functional traits indicative of plant productivity and stoichiometry leaf carbon concentration (LCC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf phosphorus concentration (LPC), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) for component species of plant communities in grazed and ungrazed plots in five Tibetan alpine meadows. We examined the diversity of traits singly Rao index of functional diversity (FDrao) and in aggregate functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), and functional evenness (FEve) in response to grazing. We tested whether foliar trait diversity increases with nutrient competition but decreases with light competition when competitive exclusion is reduced by grazing. The FDrao of LPC significantly increased under grazing, but FDrao for LCC, LNC and SLA tended to decrease. The FDrao of LDMC increased at the drier site but decreased at the wettest site. There was a strong negative association between increase in FDrao of LPC and decrease in soil nutrients, especially soil phosphorus availability. The FRic for all five traits together increased with species diversity following grazing, but neither FDiv nor FEve differed significantly between grazed and ungrazed plots at most sites. Grazing in Tibetan alpine meadows tends to increase competition for soil phosphorus while decreasing competition for light, resulting in an increase in the functional richness in grazed plant communities without any significant changes in the overall functional diversity of foliar traits. Our study highlights the potential importance of grazing mediated competition for multiple resources in alpine meadow ecosystems.","[Niu, Kechang] Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; Lechowicz, Martin J.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Zhang, Shiting] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Peking University; McGill University; Lanzhou University,"Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",kechangniu@nju.edu.cn,"Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019; Niu, Kechang/F-7648-2014; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009","Niu, Kechang/0000-0003-4845-2930; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Lechowicz, Martin/0000-0003-2562-7136",National Science Foundation of China [31370008]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956304],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"We thank Professor Shucun Sun and Julie Messier for valuable discussion and constructive comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

However, the importance of functional traits and the interactive effects of grazing exclusion and climate are poorly understood. This study, therefore, aimed to analyse the response of Leymus chinensis functional traits in long-term grazing exclusion in different habitats (rainless typical steppe and rainy meadow steppe). This study showed that although the sensitivity and variability of different traits were similar in two steppe habitats, phenotypic plasticity of L. chinensis in meadow steppe was significantly higher than typical steppes. With the increased degree of plasticity, the variability significantly increased and could be fitted by an equation of exponential rise to maximum, and this relationship was unaltered by climate. Additionally, we illustrated that different climate conditions do not alter the patterns of phenotypic plasticity of L. chinensis affected by grazing exclusion.","[Shi, G.; Liu, Z.

However, it is less well known whether this is mostly driven by the dominance of a few species and their associated traits (functional identity), or by complementarity among species that highly vary in their traits (functional diversity). The relative contribution of functional diversity and functional identity on biomass and carbon storage may in part depend on the type of functional traits that are considered, and on ecosystem type. Here, we used forest inventory data from West African semi-arid environments, and functional traits (wood density and tree maximum height) to examine the effects of functional trait identity (FI or community weighted mean; CWM) and diversity (FD or single functional divergence; FDvar) on aboveground carbon (AGC) storage in both forests and savannas. We fitted simple linear and structural equation models to test the direct and indirect effects of functional traits on AGC, while accounting for potential effects of vegetation stand structure such as stand density and basal area. When evaluated independently, CWM of tree maximum height and FDvar of wood density correlated positively with AGC, in both forests and savannas, whereas species richness was unrelated to AGC. However, structural equation models indicated different mechanisms by which these biodiversity components drove AGC in forests and savannas. In forests, species richness had an indirect, positive effect on AGC via basal area, but also an indirect, negative effect, through a reduction in CWM of maximum height. In savannas, species richness had a direct, negative effect on AGC, while both CWM of maximum height (through an increase in basal area) and FDvar of wood density had positive effects. Our study suggests that integrative models are crucial for understanding the effects of species richness, functional trait diversity, and identity on AGC across forests. Furthermore, our study shows that relationships between biodiversity and AGC differ among ecosystem types. In both forests and savannas, FI played an important role, as AGC was maximized in communities dominated by species with a high maximum height. However, only in savannas a high FD additionally promoted AGC.","[Mensah, Sylvanus] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, Cotonou, Benin; [Van der Plas, Fons] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Van der Plas, Fons] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Noulekoun, Florent] Korea Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Ecol Engn, 145 Anamro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",University of Abomey Calavi; Wageningen University & Research; Leipzig University; Korea University,"Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, Cotonou, Benin.",sylvanus.m89@gmail.com,"van der Plas, Fons/A-2242-2017","van der Plas, Fons/0000-0003-4680-543X; Mensah, Sylvanus/0000-0001-6838-749X; NOULEKOUN, Florent/0000-0003-3261-6451",BK21 PLUS Program (Brain Korea 21 Program for Leading Universities and Students); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea,BK21 PLUS Program (Brain Korea 21 Program for Leading Universities and Students); National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The authors are grateful to the colleagues at the Laboratoire de Biomath~ematiques et d'Estimations Foresti~eres, Universit~e d'Abomey-Calavi, for assisting with data collection.

The positive effects of crop diversity are well documented in tropical systems, but the conservation potential of arid agricultural systems is less clear. This study assesses the impact of three arid agroforestry systems on plant diversity and functional richness in South Sinai, Egypt: (1) mountain orchard gardens, (2) modern town gardens and (3) low desert date-palm gardens. We surveyed plants (cultivated and wild) within gardens and control plots of natural habitat and allocated each plant eight biological traits that are recognised as being linked with major ecosystem processes. Species diversity was quantified using three measures (Hill's numbers) and total species diversity was significantly higher within gardens than in the surrounding habitat at all three levels of diversity and across the three agroforestry systems. Species similarity was high between gardens and the surrounding habitat, and there was a strong overlap in the functional traits of wild plants and cultivated non-tree species. Despite the clear presence of trees within the gardens, the community weighted trait means (CWMs) showed that chamaephyte perennials were the dominant life-forms in both the gardens and the natural habitat. Functional richness differed between the three agroforestry systems, but was significantly higher within the gardens. Functional richness has been linked to increased productivity and CWMs showed that plants within the gardens were considerably taller than outside, suggesting higher biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that Bedouin agricultural practices are not having a negative effect on the flora of the region and that the continuation of these indigenous farming practices can actively benefit rare wild plants in the region. On a wider scale, this study supports the view that smallholder farms and homegardens can be valuable tools in conservation, preserving local species and maintaining ecosystem functioning.","[Norfolk, Olivia; Eichhorn, Markus P.; Gilbert, Francis] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Norfolk, O (autor correspondente), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",plxon1@nottingham.ac.uk,"Eichhorn, Markus/L-5027-2013; Norfolk, Olivia/AAL-8310-2020","Eichhorn, Markus/0000-0002-3381-0822; Norfolk, Olivia/0000-0002-2909-304X; Gilbert, Francis/0000-0002-2727-4103",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),We would like to thank The Leverhulme Trust for funding; our local guide N.

As an aggregate measure for community properties we employed the mean community trait value as the species traits averaged over an entire community with weighting by relative species abundances. For three particular types of community, in which there was competition for abiotic resources, competition for biotic resources, or species packing on an environmental gradient, we analytically proved that the responses of the mean community trait to environmental change were determined by the total trait range in the community but were weakly associated with the strength of competition and the number of species. These results were provided with simplifying assumptions that the species trait determining the resource utility equally spaced along an univariate resource axis and the competition between species was symmetrical between pairs of competing species and within the entire community. Some numerical simulations based on stochastically-generated communities and randomly-sampled natural communities indicated that relaxation of the simplifying assumptions did not considerably violate the above conclusion. The suggested determinacy of trait dynamics with variable species richness and competition regime implies that aggregated description of communities in terms of trait distributions among composite species is relevant in predicting community responses, in terms of functional traits and ecosystem function, to environmental changes.

As the need for biodiversity assessments increases in the face of accelerated global change, novel approaches that are rapid, repeatable and scalable are critical, especially in ecosystems for which information about species identity and the number of species is difficult to acquire. Here, we present 'spectral diversity'-a spectroscopic index of the variability of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants measured in the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions (400-2,400 nm). Using data collected from the Cedar Creek biodiversity experiment (Minnesota, USA), we provide evidence that the dissimilarity of species' leaf spectra increases with functional dissimilarity and evolutionary divergence time. Spectral diversity at the leaf level explains 51% of total variation in productivity-a proportion comparable to taxonomic (47%), functional (51%) or phylogenetic diversity (48%)-and performs similarly when calculated from high-resolution canopy image spectra. Spectral diversity is an emerging dimension of plant biodiversity that integrates trait variation within and across species even in the absence of taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic or abundance information, and has the potential to transform biodiversity assessment because of its scalability to remote sensing.","[Schweiger, Anna K.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Hobbie, Sarah E.; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Madritch, Michael D.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Adv Land Management Informat Technol, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Alberta; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Alberta; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Schweiger, AK; Cavender-Bares, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",aschweig@umn.edu; cavender@umn.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008; Tilman, David/ABD-5309-2021; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Wang, Ran/AGM-2266-2022; Wang, Ran/AEM-8386-2022","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630; Schweiger, Anna Katharina/0000-0002-5567-4200","National Science Foundation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Dimensions of Biodiversity programme [DEB-1342872, DEB-1342778, DEB-1342827, DEB-1342823]; Cedar Creek National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research programme [DEB-1234162]; iCORE/AITF [G224150012, 200700172]; NSERC [RGPIN-2015-05129]; CFI [26793]; China Scholarship Council; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1342778] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration through Dimensions of Biodiversity programme; Cedar Creek National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research programme; iCORE/AITF; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); CFI(Canada Foundation for Innovation); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We acknowledge B.

The results showed that both species and functional diversity increased gradually during secondary succession, they increased significantly after 30 years of stand recovery. Functional diversity could be well predicted by species diversity within each successional stage. A sigmoid logistic relationship between functional diversity and species diversity existed when all the successional stages were combined.

However, the relative importance of multiple aspects of diversity at different scales remains unclear. In this study, we investigated species, functional, and phylogenetic aspects of diversity at alpha and beta scales, and measured eight soil functions (aboveground productivity, soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, total soil phosphorus, soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus, soil carbon-nitrogen ratio, and soil nitrogen-phosphorus ratio) to comprehensively assess the relationship between multiple aspects and scales of plant diversity and soil multifunctionality along an aridity gradient across the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Diversity at alpha and beta scales explained soil multifunctionality synergistically. Functional diversity explained most of the soil multifunctionality, while phylogenetic diversity explained the least. Aridity had both direct effects on soil multifunctionality, and indirect effects mediated mainly by functional alpha and beta diversity. These findings indicate that in addition to alpha diversity, beta diversity also played an important role in maintaining soil multifunctionality, and was an important mediator for the adverse impact of aridity on soil multifunctionality. Our study highlights the critical role of beta diversity, especially regarding functional traits, in predicting the consequences of the increasingly arid conditions in the Inner Mongolian grasslands.","[Yan, Yongzhi; Zhang, Qing; Liu, Qingfu; Niu, Jianming] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Buyantuev, Alexander] SUNY Albany, Dept Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Liu, Qingfu] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Inner Mongolia University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Aarhus University,"Zhang, Q (autor correspondente), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.",qzhang82@imu.edu.cn,"Buyantuev, Alexander/L-9887-2013","Buyantuev, Alexander/0000-0003-1670-0741; Zhang, Qing/0000-0002-3489-1417; Yan, Yongzhi/0000-0001-8493-6698","National Basic Research Program of China [31760150, 31560180]; Grassland Talents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Program [12102405]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Grassland Talents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Program,This research is supported by National Basic Research Program of China (grant no. 31760150 and 31560180) and Grassland Talents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Program (grant no. 12102405).,NA,72,20,28,49,217,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Most studies on the impact of spatial self-organization have focused on systems that exhibit regular patterns. However, there is an abundance of patterns in many ecosystems which are not strictly regular. Understanding of how these patterns are formed and how they affect ecosystem function is crucial for the broad acceptance of self-organization as a keystone process in ecological theory. Here, using transplantation experiments in salt marsh ecosystems dominated by Scirpus mariqueter, we demonstrate that scale-dependent feedback is driving irregular spatial pattern formation of vegetation. Field observations and experiments have revealed that this selforganization process affects a range of plant traits, including shoot-to-root ratio, rhizome orientation, rhizome node number, and rhizome length, and enhances vegetation productivity. Moreover, patchiness in self-organized salt marsh vegetation can support a better microhabitat for macrobenthos, promoting their total abundance and spatial heterogeneity of species richness. Our results extend existing concepts of self-organization and its effects on productivity and biodiversity to the spatial irregular patterns that are observed in many systems. Our work also helps to link between the so-far largely unconnected fields of self-organization theory and trait-based, functional ecology.","[Zhao, Li-Xia; Ge, Zhen-Ming; Liu, Quan-Xing] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [van de Koppel, Johan] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands; [van de Koppel, Johan] Univ Utrecht, POB 140, NL-4400 AC Yerseke, Netherlands; [Liu, Quan-Xing] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Liu, Quan-Xing] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst Res, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Liu, Quan-Xing] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Nanjing University; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); Utrecht University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Liu, QX (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Xu, C (autor correspondente), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Liu, QX (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Liu, QX (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Tiantong Natl Stn Forest Ecosyst Res, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Liu, QX (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",xuchi@nju.edu.cn; qxliu@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn,"Liu, Quan-Xing/E-4892-2010","Liu, Quan-Xing/0000-0002-8602-0154; Xu, Chi/0000-0002-1841-9032","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0506001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41676084, 31770512, 41871088]; Project of the Thousand Young Talents Plan in China",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of the Thousand Young Talents Plan in China,"This research was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0506001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41676084, 31770512 and 41871088), and Project of the Thousand Young Talents Plan in China.",NA,65,24,27,18,88,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

However, changes in biodiversity may be only one of many pathways through which land use alters ecosystem functioning, and its importance relative to other pathways remains unclear. In particular, although biodiversity-ecosystem function research has focused primarily on grasslands, the increases in agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and grazing pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide have been largely ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year) manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity caused marked, consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition and diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of) direct, indirect, and interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource availability exerted dominant control over above-ground net primary production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to positive as agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence that soil resource availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity and herbivory on primary production. These changes in turn altered litter decomposition and, ultimately, soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the relevance of ANPP as a key integrator of ecosystem functioning. Our study reveals how human alterations of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces together interact to control the functioning of grazing systems, the most extensive land use on Earth.","[Laliberte, Etienne] Univ Canterbury, Sch Forestry, Christchurch 8013, New Zealand; [Laliberte, Etienne] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol M090, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Tylianakis, Jason M.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 8013, New Zealand",University of Canterbury; University of Western Australia; University of Canterbury,"Laliberte, E (autor correspondente), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol M090, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",etienne.laliberte@uwa.edu.au,"Tylianakis, Jason/B-6634-2011; Laliberté, Etienne/B-6855-2008","Tylianakis, Jason/0000-0001-7402-5620; Laliberté, Etienne/0000-0002-3167-2622","Miss E.

Species assembly in these communities, which can affect ecosystem functions and successional trajectories, is very unpredictable. Trait-based trajectories can shed light on the recovery of ecosystem functions and enable predictions of how the regenerating communities will change with forest age. Regeneration communities are affected by initial conditions and also by canopy structure and functional traits that alter dispersers' attractiveness and coexistence mechanisms. Here we evaluated how community functional traits change over time and tested if functional diversity and composition of the established canopy, as well as the structure of the canopy and forest age, influence the functional structure of regenerating tree communities when compared to their reference forests. For this, we calculated dissimilarity in trait composition (community-weighted means) and in functional diversity of regenerating communities of each succession/restoration stand, using the tree stratum of nearby mature forests as baseline values. Functional trait information comprises leaf, wood density, and reproductive traits from tree species. Our community data contain information from natural successional forests and restoration sites, in the South-Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Predictor variables of functional dissimilarities were forest age, canopy structural variables, canopy functional composition, and functional diversity. Results showed leaf traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf nitrogen-phosphorus ratio) and seed mass varying with forest age. Canopy functional composition based on leaf traits and total basal area significantly predicted multiple trait functional dissimilarity between the regeneration component of secondary forests and their reference community values. Dissimilarity increased when the canopy was composed of species with more acquisitive traits. Difference in functional diversity was only influenced by forest age. Mid-stage secondary forests showed lower functional diversity than early-stage forests. Our results indicated the importance of canopy traits on the natural regeneration of secondary subtropical forests. If functional similarity with reference forests is a desired objective in order to recover ecosystem functions through natural regeneration, leaf functional traits of canopy trees that establish or are planted in degraded areas must be considered in the successional processes.","[Muller, Sandra Cristina; Bergamin, Rodrigo Scarton; Bordin, Kauane Maiara; Klipel, Joice; Rosenfield, Milena Fermina] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Vegetal,Programa Posgrad Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Bergamin, Rodrigo Scarton] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Lab Estudos Vegetacao Campestre, Programa Posgrad Bot, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Rosenfield, Milena Fermina] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia,"Muller, SC (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Lab Ecol Vegetal,Programa Posgrad Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",sandra.muller@ufrgs.br,"Bordin, Kauane Maiara/V-6640-2019; Müller, Sandra/G-3739-2012; Klipel, Joice/GSN-0905-2022","Bordin, Kauane Maiara/0000-0003-3871-6293; Müller, Sandra/0000-0002-6316-2897; Klipel, Joice/0000-0003-3936-9692",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES) through the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [309659/2019-1]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS) [2218-2551/12-2],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES) through the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)),"This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES) through the Programa de Excelencia Academica (PROEX) and the Portal de Periodicos, by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq grant number 309659/2019-1 to SCM) and by the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS process 2218-2551/12-2).",NA,78,0,0,10,35,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

AS plant functional diversity is expected to stabilize ecosystem functions, we tested whether mixing species with contrasting root systems could improve the resilience of Mediterranean grasslands under increasing aridity. We hypothesized that root functional identity (RFI) and diversity (RFD) respectively determines and improves soil water uptake capacity, aboveground biomass (AGB) production and resilience after drought stress (=post-stress AGB/pre-stress AGB). Monocultures, two- and three Species mixtures of two groups of perennial grasses (cultivars and native species) were compared in a twin 3-years field experiment under two levels of summer drought in southern France. RFI and RFD were assessed as the mean and variance of multiple root traits (rooting depth, deep root mass fraction, root tissue density, root diameter and specific root length) measured in species monocultures. AGB and resilience were assessed from annual harvests; total transpirable soil water (TTSW) and evapotranspiration in summer (ET_sum) were assessed through the monitoring of soil water content. For both groups of species, RFI was a major predictor of TTSW and resilience, but not of AGB or ET_sum. Greater water uptake, especially from deep soil layers, increased resilience. Rooting depth distribution determined the potential depth of water uptake while root morphology influenced the precision of water uptake along the soil profile. However, RFD only marginally improved AGB production and resilience, although long-term effects of RFD should be tested. Designing artificial plant communities under water limited conditions should therefore prioritize the maximization of rooting depth and root distribution along the soil profile. Diversifying root morphological traits associated with resource acquisition could also have a positive impact. The similarity of results between cultivars and native species suggests that agro-ecological guidelines for species assembly can be based on advances of functional ecology in natural ecosystems.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1) community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao's quadratic diversity (FDQ) to predict biomass production and measures of biodiversity effects in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with different species richness (2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and different functional group number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) four years after establishment. Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures of biodiversitity effects (40-82% of explained variation) than species richness per se (<1-13% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger amount of variation in community biomass (80%) and net biodiversity effects (70%) than FDQ (36 and 38% of explained variation respectively). FDQ explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24%, positive relationship) and selection effects (28%, negative relationship) as CWM (27% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FDQ led to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FDQ were mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that effects of dominant species were associated with different trait combinations. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production.","[Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Stochast, Jena, Germany; [Gubsch, Marlen; Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lipowsky, Annett; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Lipowsky, Annett; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Max Planck Society; University of Zurich; Leipzig University,"Roscher, C (autor correspondente), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany.",christiane.roscher@ufz.de,"Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219","German Science Foundation [FOR456, Ro2397/3-1]; University of Jena; Max Planck Society",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Jena; Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX),"The Jena Experiment is funded by the German Science Foundation (FOR456) with additional support from the University of Jena and the Max Planck Society.

However, it is unclear the mechanism by which multiple limiting resources affect plant aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in desert steppe. Methods We conducted a field experiment manipulating both precipitation (3 levels: ambient and +/- 50% precipitation) and nutrients addition (3 levels: ambient; nitrogen (N) addition; N/phosphorus (P)/potassium (K) addition) in a factorial design. We focused on the effects of these treatments on species diversity (species richness, Shannon index, abundance), ANPP, plant functional traits, and soil properties. We used structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of precipitation amount and nutrient addition on ANPP through affecting species diversity and functional traits. Results Increasing precipitation increased species diversity and ANPP. NPK addition and increased 50% precipitation significantly increased ANPP over all other treatment combinations. Drought (-50%) reduced plant height and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), but increased leaf nitrogen content (LNC). Species richness, abundance, height and LDMC were positively correlated with ANPP, while specific leaf area (SLA) and LNC were negatively correlated with ANPP. SEM suggested that precipitation amount indirectly affected ANPP through its effect on abundance and SLA, while nutrient addition indirectly affected ANPP only through its effect on abundance. Conclusion In desert steppe, the interaction of precipitation and nutrient addition had a significant positive effect on ANPP, which was mainly mediated by species diversity and functional traits. Our results highlight the importance of species diversity and functional traits in driving short-term responses of ANPP to environmental factors in desert steppe ecosystems.","[Guo, Xinxin; Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Li, Xiangyun; Hu, Ya; Chen, Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinxin; Zuo, Xiaoan; Li, Xiangyun; Hu, Ya] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinxin; Li, Xiangyun; Hu, Ya] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinxin; Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Li, Xiangyun; Chen, Min] Key Lab Stress Physiol & Ecol Cold & Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS","Zuo, XA (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",guoxinxin@lzb.ac.cn; zuoxa@lzb.ac.cn; yueping@lzb.ac.cn; lixiangyun19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; huya@lzb.ac.cn; chenmin1360@126.com; yuqiang@caas.cn,"?, ?/GWC-4881-2022; Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011","Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604802]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071140]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [1100000036]; Light of West China program CAS [E129050301],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Light of West China program CAS,"This paper was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0604802), National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071140) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (1100000036), Light of West China program CAS (E129050301).",NA,74,6,6,45,140,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,FEB,2022,471,1-fev.,,,,NA,527,540,,10.1007/s11104-021-05206-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05206-2,NA,jan.-22,14,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,ZJ5TR,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000739232900001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most of the existing studies focus on the effect of warming only on species diversity and productivity, we further investigated (i) how the structure of community plant functional traits in temperate grasslands respond to experimental warming, and (ii) whether species and functional diversity contribute to a greater stability of grasslands, in terms of vegetation composition and productivity. Intact vegetation turves were extracted from temperate subalpine grassland (highland) in the Eastern Pyrenees and transplanted into a warm continental, experimental site in Lleida, in Western Catalonia (lowland). The impacts of simulated warming on plant production and diversity, functional trait structure, and vegetation compositional stability were assessed. We observed an increase in biomass and a reduction in species and functional diversity under short-term warming. The functional structure of the grassland communities changed significantly, in terms of functional diversity and community-weighted means (CWM) for several traits. Acquisitive and fast-growing species with higher SLA, early flowering, erect growth habit, and rhizomatous strategy became dominant in the lowland. Productivity was significantly positively related to species, and to a lower extent, functional diversity, but productivity and stability after warming were more dependent on trait composition (CWM) than on diversity. The turves with more acquisitive species before warming changed less in composition after warming. Results suggest that (i) the short-term warming can lead to the dominance of acquisitive fast growing species over conservative species, thus reducing species richness, and (ii) the functional traits structure in grassland communities had a greater influence on the productivity and stability of the community under short-term warming, compared to diversity effects. In summary, short-term climate warming can greatly alter vegetation functional structure and its relation to productivity.","[Debouk, Haifa; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Lab Funct Ecol & Global Change ECOFUN, Solsona, Spain; [Debouk, Haifa; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Univ Lleida, Sch Agrifood & Forestry Sci & Engn, Grp GAMES, Lleida, Spain; [Debouk, Haifa; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa] Univ Lleida, Sch Agrifood & Forestry Sci & Engn, Dept Hort Bot & Gardening, Lleida, Spain; [de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Trebo, Czech Republic",Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Universitat de Lleida; Universitat de Lleida; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Debouk, H (autor correspondente), Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Lab Funct Ecol & Global Change ECOFUN, Solsona, Spain.",haifa.debouk@ctfc.es,"de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; Sebastia, M.

In terrestrial systems, aboveground and belowground vegetation quantity and quality are coupled, and both influence belowground microbial processes and nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that ecosystem productivity, and the chemical, structural and phylogenetic-functional composition of plant communities would be detectable with remote sensing and could be used to predict belowground plant and soil processes in two grassland biodiversity experiments: the BioDIV experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota and the Wood River Nature Conservancy experiment in Nebraska. We tested whether aboveground vegetation chemistry and productivity, as detected from airborne sensors, predict soil properties, microbial processes and community composition. Imaging spectroscopy data were used to map aboveground biomass, green vegetation cover, functional traits and phylogenetic-functional community composition of vegetation. We examined the relationships between the image-derived variables and soil carbon and nitrogen concentration, microbial community composition, biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, and soil processes, including net nitrogen mineralization. In the BioDIV experiment-which has low overall diversity and productivity despite high variation in each-belowground processes were driven mainly by variation in the amount of organic matter inputs to soils. As a consequence, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity, and fungal and bacterial composition and diversity were significantly predicted by remotely sensed vegetation cover and biomass. In contrast, at Wood River-where plant diversity and productivity were consistently higher-belowground processes were driven mainly by variation in the quality of aboveground inputs to soils. Consequently, remotely sensed functional, chemical and phylogenetic composition of vegetation predicted belowground extracellular enzyme activity, microbial biomass, and net nitrogen mineralization rates but aboveground biomass (or cover) did not. The contrasting associations between the quantity (productivity) and quality (composition) of aboveground inputs with belowground soil attributes provide a basis for using imaging spectroscopy to understand belowground processes across productivity gradients in grassland systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how above and belowground components interact among different ecosystems remains critical to extending these results broadly.","[Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Schweiger, Anna K.; Helzer, Kimberly; Lapadat, Cathleen; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schweiger, Anna K.] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Schweiger, Anna K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gamon, John A.; Gholizadeh, Hamed] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB AB T6G, Canada; [Gholizadeh, Hamed] Oklahoma State Univ, Ctr Applicat Remote Sensing, Dept Geog, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Madritch, Michael D.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.; Wang, Zhihui] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Universite de Montreal; University of Zurich; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Alberta; University of Alberta; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Cavender-Bares, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",cavender@umn.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008; wang, zhihui/HSF-6639-2023; gholizadeh, hamed/HRE-1528-2023; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Gamon, John/A-2641-2014","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774; Hobbie, Sarah/0000-0001-5159-031X; Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723; Schweiger, Anna Katharina/0000-0002-5567-4200; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630; Gholizadeh, Hamed/0000-0002-4770-7893",NSF/NASA [DEB-1342872]; NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND [DBI: 2021898]; Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF [DEB 1831944]; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich,NSF/NASA(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND; Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF; University Research Priority Program Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich,"The project was funded by NSF/NASA DEB-1342872; the NSF Biology Integration Institute ASCEND, DBI: 2021898; and the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program through NSF DEB 1831944.

The traditional summer hay-making followed by autumn grazing is no longer economic and question is whether alternative managements can maintain both plant species and functional diversity typical of these habitats. In the Bohemian Forest Mts., we applied three treatments (mowing once a year - i.e., cutting and removing the biomass, mulching once a year - cutting and leaving the crushed biomass to decompose in situ, fallowing - no cutting) in order to assess temporal changes in meadow vegetation, plant trait composition and biomass production in a 13-year experiment. We recorded for each species twenty-five traits as to be most informative of plant strategies related to growth, resource acquisition and carbon-water economy. We compared different components of trait composition (community averages that mostly reflect traits of dominant species vs. the Rao index of functional diversity that reflects trait dissimilarity among species) and their impact on biomass production. We show that mulching promotes species and functional diversity by facilitating heliophilous forbs and legumes with more acquisitive strategies in resource use and release, e.g., higher foliar N and P content. This occurs at the expense of tall grasses (with resource-retentive strategies, e.g., high leaf dry matter content) which dominate the mown and fallow plots. The divergence in most quantitative traits indicates that niche complementarity is the dominant assembly process in mulched plots, which can prevent competitive exclusion and enable species coexistence. The divergent development was detected only after 5-6 years. This slow floristic and functional response is caused by acidity of soil and severe mountain climate that preclude rapid responses of vegetation to land-use changes. We conclude that mulching represents a good compromise maintaining both plant species and functional diversity as well as a relatively high biomass production. Mowing without grazing leads to gradual nutrient loss and thus reduces the productivity and diversity in these oligotrophic ecosystems. Fallowing causes gradual loss in diversity by increased grass competition and litter accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This research has been accompanied by a controversial discussion how diversity effects in experimental communities are related to the role of biodiversity in real-world ecosystems. To explore potential relationships, we compared plant community characteristics of 12 semi-natural managed reference grasslands to selected 10-year old communities of a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment): two communities initially sown with 60 species (JE60), and two communities assembled naturally during succession from bare soil (JESuc). Compared to semi-natural grasslands (17.6 +/- 5.6), JE60 had higher species richness (27.5 +/- 0.8), while species richness in JESuc (15.2 +/- 0.5) was not different on subplots of 0.64m(2) size. Evenness and spatial heterogeneity were similar among grassland types, but biomass proportions of legumes and forbs were higher in JE60, while JESuc and semi-natural grasslands were dominated by grasses. Structural equation modelling applied to identify the drivers of biomass production in mixtures of the Jena Experiment with similar species richness (sown with 8, 16, and 60 species) and reference grasslands, showed no direct relationships between observed species richness and biomass production. In contrast, functional characteristics related to nitrogen acquisition and use were the most important variables explaining community biomass production. These functional characteristics were either driven by management intensity (fertilisation) in the real world reference grasslands or established by sowing in the experimental grasslands. Our results imply that species functional characteristics are key for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and ecosystem functioning and that the drivers of ecosystem functioning are not fundamentally different between experimental and real-world grasslands. Thus, experimental studies with designed extinction scenarios may help to predict the consequences of species loss for ecosystem functioning in realworld ecosystems.","[Buchmann, Tina] UFZ, Community Ecol, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Math, Stochast, Ernst Abbe Pl 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico; Weigelt, Alexandra; Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischer, Markus] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Gleixner, Gerd; Lange, Markus; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Hacker, Nina; Oelmann, Yvonne] Univ Tubingen, Geoecol, Rumelinstr 19-23, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85350 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Wilcke, Wolfgang] KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] UFZ, Physiol Divers, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Leipzig University; University of Bern; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Max Planck Society; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Leipzig University; Technical University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Buchmann, T (autor correspondente), UFZ, Community Ecol, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",tina.buchmann@ufz.de,"Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014; Oelmann, Yvonne/J-8730-2016; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Gleixner, Gerd/M-8519-2017; Gleixner, Gerd/O-4215-2019","Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Oelmann, Yvonne/0000-0003-3513-6568; Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Lange, Markus/0000-0002-2802-9177","German Research Foundation [RO2397/6, GL262/19, FOR456/1451]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation,"This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (RO2397/6, GL262/19 and FOR456/1451).

Quantifying changes in traits can help us understand invasive species impacts on communities; however, both the invader and the plant community may be responding to the same environmental drivers. In North America, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is a problematic invader that reduces plant diversity and forage production for live-stock. Its documented effects on plant communities differ amongst studies, however, potentially due to differences in productivity or land management. To identify the potential effects of leafy spurge on plant communities, we quantified leafy spurge abundance, plant species richness, forage production, functional group composition and community weighted mean traits, intensively at a single site and extensively across ten sites differing in management. We then tested how leafy spurge abundance related to these variables as a function of site management activities. Leafy spurge abundance was consistently associated with fewer plant species, reduced forage production and more invasive grass. Community-weighted specific root length also consistently increased with leafy spurge abundance, suggesting that belowground competi-tion may be important in determining co-existence with leafy spurge. Other changes were dependent on management. Native forbs were excluded as leafy spurge became more abundant, but only in grazed sites as these species were already absent from ungrazed sites. Taller plants better persisted in dense leafy spurge patches, but only in grazed sites, consistent with either facilitation of taller species via associational defences or competitive exclusion of shorter species in ungrazed sites and dense leafy spurge patches. These results show that, despite some emergent properties of invasion, management context can alter invasion impacts by causing changes in the plant community and its interactions with the invader.","[Liu, Catherine; Groff, Terava; Anderson, Erin; Paulow, Lee; Bennett, Jonathan A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B5, Canada; [Brown, Charlotte; Cahill Jr, James F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Brown, Charlotte] Univ Arizona, Desert Lab Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Saskatchewan; University of Alberta; University of Arizona,"Bennett, JA (autor correspondente), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B5, Canada.",jon.bennett@usask.ca,,,"NSERC Discovery Grant; NSERC Collaborative Research and Development Grant,; Saskatchewan Cattlemen's Association; University of Saskatchewan; University of Alberta Rangeland Research Institute; NSERC USRA; University of Saskatchewan USRA","NSERC Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); NSERC Collaborative Research and Development Grant,(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Saskatchewan Cattlemen's Association; University of Saskatchewan; University of Alberta Rangeland Research Institute; NSERC USRA(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); University of Saskatchewan USRA","We would like to thank Jacqueline Gelineau, Christopher Thorpe, Anna Jacobson and Amanda Mitchell for their help with collecting plant community data and processing samples.

Here, we combine metrics from BEF research that distinguish the contribution of dominant species (selection effects, SE) from those due to positive interactions such as resource partitioning (complementarity effects, CE) with a functional trait approach in an attempt to reveal the functional characteristics of species that drive community biomass in species mixtures. In a biodiversity experiment with 16 plant species in monocultures, 4-species and 16-species mixtures, we used aboveground biomass to determine the relative contributions of CE and SE to biomass production in mixtures in the second, dry year of the experiment. We also measured root traits (specific root length, root length density, root tissue density and the deep root fraction) of each species in monocultures and linked the calculated community weighted mean (CWM) trait values and trait diversity of mixtures to CE and SE. In the second year of the experiment, community biomass, CE and SE increased compared to the first year. The contribution of SE to this positive effect was greater than that of CE. The increased contribution of SE was associated with root traits: SE increased most in communities with high abundance of species with deep, thick and dense roots. In contrast, changes in CE were not related to trait diversity or CWM trait values. Together, these results suggest that increased positive effects of species richness on community biomass in a dry year were mainly driven by increased dominance of deep-rooting species, supporting the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity. Positive CE indicates that other positive interactions did occur, but we could not find evidence that belowground resource partitioning or facilitation via root trait diversity was important for community productivity in our biodiversity experiment.","[Bakker, Lisette M.; Mommer, Liesje; van Ruijven, Jasper] Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"van Ruijven, J (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ & Res, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3A, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",jasper.vanruijven@wur.nl,"van Ruijven, Jasper/ABE-7791-2020; Mommer, Liesje/ABF-7005-2020; van Ruijven, Jasper/D-9848-2011","van Ruijven, Jasper/0000-0003-0003-2363; Mommer, Liesje/0000-0002-3775-0716; ","Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the Netherlands; NWO VIDI grant [864.14.006]","Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the Netherlands(Netherlands Government); NWO VIDI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","This study was supported by the Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the Netherlands.

Plant biodiversity can also influence C exchange, yet few studies integrate how biotic and abiotic factors may directly or interactively impact ecosystem C flux. Here, we examine the link between simultaneous changes in multiple dimensions of plant diversity and peak growing season ecosystem C uptake across a climatic gradient in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. We found that taxonomic diversity (species richness), functional diversity (functional evenness), and phylogenetic diversity (mean pairwise distance) were significantly and positively related to peak growing season ecosystem C uptake (i.e., net ecosystem exchange) when considered independently. However, when abiotic and biotic factors were integrated in a structural equation model, only plant phylogenetic diversity was significantly related to C uptake. In addition, we found that actual evapotranspiration (AET-a measure that integrates precipitation and temperature) affected ecosystem C exchange indirectly via its impact on the three dimensions of plant diversity that we examined. These findings highlight complex relationships among key measures of biodiversity and ecosystem C uptake in a rapidly warming ecosystem, and the possible mechanisms that underlie relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. They also point to the need for integrating multiple dimensions of biodiversity into studies of community and ecosystem ecology.","[Prager, Case M.; Jing, Xin; Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Prager, Case M.; Sanders, Nathan J.; Sundqvist, Maja; Classen, Aimee T.] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jing, Xin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Jing, Xin; Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT USA; [Henning, Jeremiah A.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Biol, 5871 LISA Dr N, Mobile, AL USA; [Henning, Jeremiah A.; Read, Quentin D.; Meidl, Peter; Sanders, Nathan J.; Classen, Aimee T.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO USA; [Read, Quentin D.] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD USA; [Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Sundqvist, Maja] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Earth Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wardle, David A.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; KU Leuven; University of Vermont; University of South Alabama; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Gothenburg; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Prager, CM (autor correspondente), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Prager, CM (autor correspondente), Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark.",cmprager@umich.edu,"Classen, Aimee T/AAM-5671-2021; Jing, Xin/I-7882-2016; Henning, Jeremiah A/Y-7466-2018; Nummer2, CMEC/HKE-1900-2023; Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020; Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Jing, Xin/0000-0002-7146-7180; Henning, Jeremiah A/0000-0002-2214-4895; Read, Quentin/0000-0003-4315-5582; Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731","Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Tennessee; RMBL: the Dr. Jean Langenheim Fellowship; Dr. Lee R.

However, whether biodiversity loss is a major component of global change effects on multifunctionality in real-world ecosystems, as in experimental ones, remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional composition and 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We also introduce five multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according to realistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodiversity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average. Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explained indirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-use objectives favoured supporting and cultural services. In contrast, functional composition shifts, towards fast-growing plant species, strongly increased provisioning services in more inherently unproductive grasslands.","[Allan, Eric; Manning, Pete; Blaser, Stefan; Grassein, Fabrice; Prati, Daniel; Schmitt, Barbara; Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Allan, Eric] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Alt, Fabian; Oelmann, Yvonne; Sorkau, Elisabeth] Univ Tubingen, Geocol, D-72070 Tubingen, Germany; [Binkenstein, Julia; Schaefer, Martin] Univ Freiburg, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Fac Biol, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Bluethgen, Nico] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Biol, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Boehm, Stefan; Renner, Swen C.; Tschapka, Marco] Univ Ulm, Inst Expt Ecol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Hoelzel, Norbert; Klaus, Valentin H.; Kleinebecker, Till] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Morris, E.

In forested landscapes, power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher cutting frequency is recommended.","[Steinert, Mari; Moe, Stein R.; Sydenham, Markus A.

Investigating functional traits in coastal systems has the potential to inform how variation in disturbance frequency and environmental variables influence differences in trait-based community composition and ecosystem function. Our goals were to (1) quantify trait-based communities on two barrier islands divergent in topography and long-term disturbance response and (2) determine relationships between community trait-based composition and ecosystem productivity. We hypothesized that locations documented with high disturbance would have habitats with similar environmental conditions and trait-based communities, with the opposite relationship in low-disturbance locations. Furthermore, we expected higher productivity and lower site-to-site variation with low disturbance. Functional traits, biomass, and environmental metrics (soil salinity, elevation, and distance to shoreline) were collected and analyzed for two habitat types (dune and swale) on two Virginia barrier islands. Our results show that trait-based community composition differed among habitat types and was related to disturbance. Habitats exhibited more similarity on the high-disturbance island in both trait-based composition and environmental variables. Conversely, the low-disturbance island habitats were more dissimilar. We found the habitat with the lowest disturbance had the highest ecosystem productivity and had trait-based communities indicative of highly competitive environments, while the high-disturbance trait-based communities were influenced by traits that indicate rapid recovery and growth. Site-to-site variation was similar in all dune habitats but differed among inter-island swale habitats that varied in disturbance. These results highlight the importance of incorporating trait-based analyses when approaching questions about community structure and ecosystem productivity in disturbance-mediated habitats, such as coastal systems.","[Brown, Joseph K.; Zinnert, Julie C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Brown, Joseph K.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Integrat Life Sci Doctoral Program, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Zinnert, JC (autor correspondente), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jczinnert@vcu.edu,,"Zinnert, Julie/0000-0003-2578-7236; Brown, Joseph/0000-0002-3828-4729","National Science Foundation [DEB-1237733, DEB-1832221]; Virginia Coast Reserve; Nature Conservancy; UVA Coastal Research Center",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Virginia Coast Reserve; Nature Conservancy; UVA Coastal Research Center,"We extend thanks to the National Science Foundation (DEB-1237733 and DEB-1832221 to JC Zinnert), the Virginia Coast Reserve, the Nature Conservancy, and the UVA Coastal Research Center for research and funding support.

Most studies have focused on the influence of species richness on ecosystem stability and found positive diversity-stability relationships. However, land use and abiotic factors shape species richness and functional composition of plant communities and may override species richness-stability relations in managed grasslands. We analysed the relative importance of land-use intensity (LUI), resident plant species richness and functional composition for recovery of plant communities (plant species richness, plant cover, above- and below-ground biomass) and release of soil nutrients after a severe mechanical disturbance. Experimental sward disturbance was applied to 73 grassland sites along a LUI gradient in three German regions. We considered relative (ln(disturbance/control)) and absolute (disturbance - control) treatment effects. Using structural equation modelling, we disentangled direct effects of LUI and resident species richness on recovery and indirect effects via changes in functional richness. Community-weighted-mean traits rarely mattered for recovery or nutrient release, while functional richness especially increased relative recovery of plant communities but also relative release of NO3-N and NH4-N. These effects were enhanced by increasing resident plant species richness and decreasing LUI. Next to these indirect influences of LUI and resident plant species richness via functional community composition, grasslands of high compared with grasslands of low resident plant species richness generally showed decreased recovery of plant communities. In grasslands of high LUI, absolute recovery of some aspects of plant communities was decreased. We did not find consistent differences between the relative importance of the different drivers of recovery after the first and the second season. Overall, resident species richness seemed most important for relative recovery and less important for absolute recovery, where direct effects of LUI were more common. Synthesis. The stability of ecosystems in managed grasslands depends on more than species richness. Thus, drivers that directly affect species richness and functional community composition have to be considered when studying the stability of real-world ecosystems. More specifically, in managed grasslands high resident species richness but also high land-use intensity (LUI) decreased the stability of ecosystem functions, which was partially buffered by increases in functional richness.","[Schaefer, Deborah; Hinderling, Judith; Fischer, Markus; Prati, Daniel] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Klaus, Valentin H.; Kleinebecker, Till; Hoelzel, Norbert; Hamer, Ute] Munster Univ, Inst Landscape Ecol, Munster, Germany; [Klaus, Valentin H.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kleinebecker, Till] Giessen Univ, Inst Landscape Ecol & Resource Management, Giessen, Germany; [Boeddinghaus, Runa S.; Kandeler, Ellen; Marhan, Sven] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Soil Sci & Land Evaluat, Dept Soil Biol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Nowak, Sascha] Munster Univ, MEET, Munster, Germany; [Sonnemann, Iija; Wurst, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Ctr Plant Sci, Berlin, Germany",University of Bern; University of Munster; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University Hohenheim; University of Munster; Free University of Berlin,"Schafer, D (autor correspondente), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland.",deborah.schaefer@boga.unibe.ch,"Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Klaus, Valentin H./HKM-8112-2023; Nowak, Sascha/L-8453-2014; Hamer, Ute/J-5519-2016","Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Klaus, Valentin H./0000-0002-7469-6800; Nowak, Sascha/0000-0003-1508-6073; Schafer, Deborah/0000-0001-9591-841X; Kandeler, Ellen/0000-0002-2854-0012; Kleinebecker, Till/0000-0003-1121-2861; Hamer, Ute/0000-0002-3845-3983",,,,NA,67,13,13,9,105,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Studies have shown that productivity would change following fertilization in the grassland. The response of productivity to fertilization mainly depends on the dominant species traits. Trait-based methods provide a useful tool for explaining the variations in grassland productivity following fertilization. However, the relative contribution of plant functional traits to grassland productivity under N and P addition in the Loess Plateau is not clear. We measured aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf N content (LN), leaf P content (LP), leaf N/P ratio (LN/P), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf tissue density (LTD), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and maximum plant height (H-max) to study how these plant functional traits regulate the relative biomass of different species and grassland productivity following fertilization. Our results showed, that under different nutrient addition levels, the linkages between plant functional traits and the relative biomass of different species were different. Community AGB was positively related to community-weighted mean LN (CWM_LN), CWM_LN/P, CWM_SLA, and CWM_H-max, but negatively related to CWM_LTD and CWM_LDMC. Dominant species traits largely determined grassland productivity, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. These findings further highlight the close linkages between community-level functional traits and grassland productivity. Our study contributes to the mechanisms underlying biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and has significance for guiding semiarid grassland management.","[Yang, Yuting; Wei, Jiaqi; Zhu, Xiaoxu; Yao, Hongbin; Wen, Zhongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Grassland Agr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhifei] Guizhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bingcheng; Wen, Zhongming] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Guizhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China","Wen, ZM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Grassland Agr, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wen, ZM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",zmwen@ms.iswc.ac.cn,"yang, yuting/HTT-2479-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41977077, 41671289]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41977077 and 41671289).,NA,47,2,2,26,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,AUG,2022,11,15,,NA,,NA,,,2045,10.3390/plants11152045,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11152045,NA,,10,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,3S0TX,35956523,"gold, Green Published",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000839317500001,View Full Record in Web of Science,Davi,sim,,sim,sim,sim,grassland,temperate;subtropical,NA,SLA;Leaf_tissue_density;LDMC;LNC;LPC;N/P_ratio;Maximum_plant_height,,,positiva,negativa,NA,positiva,,,NA,NA,positiva,positiva,NA,negativa,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity FD is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Biodivers & Macroecol Grp, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Petchey, OL (autor correspondente), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Biodivers & Macroecol Grp, Alfred Denny Bldg,Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",o.petchey@shef.ac.uk,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633",,,,NA,54,1160,1246,72,960,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

While causes and consequences of woody expansion have been well documented, few studies have addressed plant functional traits that promote dramatic and rapid expansion in range. Our objectives were to investigate plant functional traits that contribute to the colonization, rapid expansion, and thicket formation of an invasive, N-fixing shrub, Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb. (Elaeagnaceae), and a native, N-fixing shrub Morella cerifera (L.) Small (Myricaceae) and compare to native, sympatric, non-expanding shrub species. Quantified functional traits included morphological (e.g., specific leaf area, leaf area) and physiological characteristics (e.g., electron transport rate, hydraulic conductivity) and were linked to two primary resources: light and water, which directly influence plant growth. Elaeagnus umbellata and M.cerifera rely on different strategies to maximize carbon gain, yet resulting physiological efficiency is similar. Elaeagnus umbellata invests a substantial amount of energy into growth during a short amount of time (i.e., deciduous growing season), using an acquisitive trait strategy to outcompete cooccurring woody species, while M. cerifera is productive year-round and uses a combination of conservative and acquisitive traits to outcompete co-occurring woody species. The majority of quantified functional traits of E. umbellata and several of M. cerifera are indicative of efficient light capture, utilization, and internal water movement. These factors contribute to rapid range expansion and thicket formation by promoting enhanced productivity while simultaneously inhibiting colonization and expansion of co-occurring species. Suites of functional traits are important for expansive success and thicket formation, yet differences in functional traits represent alternative strategies for colonization, rapid expansion, and thicketization.","[Shiflett, Sheri A.; Zinnert, Julie C.; Young, Donald R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Zinnert, JC (autor correspondente), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",jczinnert@vcu.edu,,,NSF [DEB-1237733],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was supported in part by NSF grant DEB-1237733 for LTER-related work at the Virginia Coast Reserve.

Exploring the mechanisms by which biodiversity at different levels influences ecosystem functioning is a major challenge in the field of ecology. In this study, by constructing plant communities with different diversity levels of both dominant species (Stipa grandis) genotype and common species in a mesocosm experiment, we analyzed the relative importance of dominant genotype diversity and common species diversity on biomass production through Fox's tripartite partition, and the relationships between community functional diversity and biomass pro-duction. For common species mixtures (G0S5), a significant positive net diversity effect on belowground biomass was found, and the net effect was contributed by a significant positive dominance effect and a significant negative trait-independent complementarity effect. For genotype mixtures of S. grandis (G5S0), a significant positive net di-versity effect on aboveground biomass and a non-significant positive net diversity effect on belowground biomass were found, and both the effects were driven by positive trait-independent complementarity effects. The increases in both dominant genotype and common species diversity (G5S5) led to remarkable positive net diversity effects, with a significant positive trait-independent complementarity effect on belowground biomass and all the three bio-diversity effect components on aboveground biomass being significantly positive. Only a small proportion (3/22) of relationships between community functional diversity and biomass were linear by a first order polynomial estima-tion. The significant positive trait-independent complementarity effect in G5S0 and trait-dependent complementar-ity effect in G5S5 could not be explained by the smaller intraspecific trait variation. These findings highlight the underestimated and overlooked roles of dominant genotypic diversity for ecosystem functioning, and are very im-portant for grassland protection and management, especially in the semi-arid typical steppe .

Biodiversity effects might increase agricultural yields at no cost in additional inputs. However, the effects of diversity on crop assemblages are inconsistent, probably because crops and wild plants differ in a range of traits relevant to plant-plant interactions. We tested whether domestication has changed the potential of crop mixtures to over-yield by comparing the performance and traits of major crop species and those of their wild progenitors under varying levels of diversity. We found stronger biodiversity effects in mixtures of wild progenitors, due to larger selection effects. Variation in selection effects was partly explained by within-mixture differences in leaf size. Our results indicate that domestication might disrupt the ability of crops to benefit from diverse neighbourhoods via reduced trait variance. These results highlight potential limitations of current crop mixtures to over-yield and the potential of breeding to re-establish variance and increase mixture performance.","[Chacon-Labella, Julia; Garcia Palacios, Pablo; Matesanz, Silvia; Milla, Ruben] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Chacon-Labella, Julia; Schob, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Chacon-Labella, Julia] INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Chacon-Labella, J (autor correspondente), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain.;Chacon-Labella, J (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Chacon-Labella, J (autor correspondente), INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, A Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",juliachacon@gmail.com,"Matesanz, Silvia/L-5153-2014; Labella, Julia Chacon/AAX-4838-2020; Schöb, Christian/B-6083-2008; Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/K-7567-2014; Milla, Ruben/A-3739-2009","Matesanz, Silvia/0000-0003-0060-6136; Schöb, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286; Garcia-Palacios, Pablo/0000-0002-6367-4761; Chacon Labella, Julia Maria/0000-0002-6787-1295; Milla, Ruben/0000-0001-8912-4373","MINECO [CGL2017-83855-R, PCIN-2014-053] Funding Source: Medline; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3-170645] Funding Source: Medline; Juan de la Cierva Incorporación Program [IJCI-2014-20058] Funding Source: Medline; Juan de la Cierva and Ramón y Cajal programs Funding Source: Medline; Juan de la Cierva Formación Program [FJCI-2016-31065] Funding Source: Medline",MINECO(Spanish Government); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Juan de la Cierva Incorporación Program; Juan de la Cierva and Ramón y Cajal programs; Juan de la Cierva Formación Program,,NA,77,16,16,6,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Traits associated with rapid resource capture may come at the expense of those related to stress resistance. In annual plants, such a tradeoff may be reflected through plant size (biomass) vs. biomass partitioning patterns, as the former represents resource capture rate while the latter represents reorganization to cope with resource stress. In a water-limited annual plant community we investigated: 1) the effects of water and nitrogen availability on plant size and biomass partitioning, i.e., biomass partitioning between organs (root to shoot ratio, R/S, and reproductive effort, Rep/Veg), and biomass partitioning in space (specific leaf area, SLA), 2) the relationship between plant size and biomass partitioning at both the interspecific and intraspecific level, and 3) the relationships between plant size and biomass partitioning strategy and stress resistance. Eight key species varying in their natural size range were grown under variable water and nitrogen availability and their size and biomass partitioning were monitored throughout their growth and at fixed phenological phases. In all species, reduced water and/or nitrogen availability was associated with smaller size, increased R/S, and decreased SLA while Rep/Veg remained constant. At the intraspecific level, plant size was negatively related to R/S and positively related to SLA. At the interspecific level, no relationship was found between size or stress resistance and any of the biomass-partitioning traits or their plasticity. However, species size was negatively related to stress resistance. This tradeoff between species size and stress resistance emerges as a consistent property of fundamental importance in shaping annual plant communities along resource gradients.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Phys Dept, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Agr Res Org, Volcani Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Dovrat, G (autor correspondente), Agr Res Org, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science Foundation [861/09],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"Thanks to Sivan Golan, Itzhak Kamara and all Israel Plant Gene Bank staff for help with seed storage and germination.

As such they have the potential to guide species selection for restoration projects. However, predictive trait-based models often only explain a small proportion of plant performance, suggesting that commonly measured traits do not capture all important ecological differences between species. Some residual variation in vital rates may be evolutionarily conserved and captured using taxonomic groupings alongside common functional traits. We tested this hypothesis using growth rate data for 17,299 trees and shrubs from 80 species of Eucalyptus and 43 species of Acacia, two hyper-diverse and co-occurring genera, collected from 497 neighborhood plots in 137 Australian mixed-species revegetation plantings. We modeled relative growth rates of individual plants as a function of environmental conditions, species-mean functional traits, and neighbor density and diversity, across a moisture availability gradient. We then assessed whether the strength and direction of these relationships differed between the two genera. We found that the inclusion of genus-specific relationships offered a significant but modest improvement to model fit (1.6%-1.7% greater R-2 than simpler models). More importantly, almost all correlates of growth rate differed between Eucalyptus and Acacia in strength, direction, or how they changed along the moisture gradient. These differences mapped onto physiological differences between the genera that were not captured solely by measured functional traits. Our findings suggest taxonomic groupings can capture or mediate variation in plant performance missed by common functional traits. The inclusion of taxonomy can provide a more nuanced understanding of how functional traits interact with abiotic and biotic conditions to drive plant performance, which may be important for constructing trait-based frameworks to improve restoration outcomes.","[Staples, Timothy L.; Mayfield, Margaret M.; Dwyer, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [England, Jacqueline R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Staples, TL (autor correspondente), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Staples, TL (autor correspondente), CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia.",timothy.staples@uqconnect.edu.au,"Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Mayfield, Margaret Morrow/GLT-4023-2022; Staples, Tim/AEI-0009-2022; England, Jacqueline R/G-6417-2011; Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; England, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-3371-1509; Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Staples, Timothy/0000-0002-8550-2661","Australian Government, Department of Education, Skills and Employment; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland","Australian Government, Department of Education, Skills and Employment; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); University of Queensland(University of Queensland)","Australian Government, Department of Education, Skills and Employment; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Queensland",NA,101,0,0,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Fire, like herbivory, is a top-down driver that converts organic materials into inorganic products, alters community structure, and acts as an evolutionary agent. Though grazing and fire may have some comparable effects in grasslands, they do not have similar impacts on species composition and community structure. However, the concept of fire as a global herbivore implies that fire and herbivory may have similar effects on plant functional traits. Using 22 years of data from a mesic, native tallgrass prairie with a long evolutionary history of fire and grazing, we tested if trait composition between grazed and burned grassland communities would converge, and if the degree of convergence depended on fire frequency. Additionally, we tested if eliminating fire from frequently burned grasslands would result in a state similar to unburned grasslands, and if adding fire into a previously unburned grassland would cause composition to become more similar to that of frequently burned grasslands. We found that grazing and burning once every four years showed the most convergence in traits, suggesting that these communities operate under similar deterministic assembly rules and that fire and herbivory are similar disturbances to grasslands at the trait-group level of organization. Three years after reversal of the fire treatment we found that fire reversal had different effects depending on treatment. The formerly unburned community that was then burned annually became more similar to the annually burned community in trait composition suggesting that function may be rapidly restored if fire is reintroduced. Conversely, after fire was removed from the annually burned community trait composition developed along a unique trajectory indicating hysteresis, or a time lag for structure and function to return following a change in this disturbance regime. We conclude that functional traits and species-based metrics should be considered when determining and evaluating goals for fire management in mesic grassland ecosystems.","[Spasojevic, Marko J.; Aicher, Rebecca J.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Koch, Gregory R.; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Marquardt, Emily S.] Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Mirotchnick, Nicholas] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Collins, Scott L.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; Columbia University; University of New Mexico,"Spasojevic, MJ (autor correspondente), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mspasoje@uci.edu,"SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014","SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Aicher, Rebecca/0000-0001-7912-4169",NSF [EF-0553768]; University of California-Santa Barbara; State of California; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0823341] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California-Santa Barbara(University of California System); State of California; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work resulted from a Distributed Graduate Seminar (Ushering in a New Era of Functional Ecology: Dynamics in a Changing Environment) conducted through the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center funded by NSF (Grant #EF-0553768), the University of California-Santa Barbara, and the State of California.

Functional diversity (FD) - as calculated from species traits - typically increases with species richness in communities and is expected to be higher in less extreme environments, where a broader range of functional strategies can persist. Further, woody and herbaceous plant families may contribute disproportionately to FD in different bioregions. To build an understanding of these questions using Australia as a case study, we aimed to quantify how FD varies: (a) with species richness, (b) with climate, and (c) between major plant families representing different growth forms. Location Australia. Methods Data on species distribution and functional traits for 14,003 species were combined and FD approximated using hypervolumes (i.e. multidimensional species assemblage trait niche) based on three traits key to understanding plant ecological strategies: leaf size, seed mass and adult height. Plant assemblage hypervolumes were calculated including all species with suitable habitat in each 10 x 10 km grid cell across Australia, and in each of 85 bioregions. Within bioregions FD was also calculated separately for a suite of largely woody and herbaceous plant families. Relationships between FD, species richness and climate were explored. Results As predicted, FD was positively related to species richness and annual precipitation, and negatively related to summer maximum temperature, both in analyses of 10 km x 10 km grid cells and of bioregions (all p < 0.005). However, FD was lowest at intermediate winter minimum temperatures. Patterns identified in families representing different growth forms varied to those observed for all species analysed together. Conclusions Strong links between FD and climate could mean significant shifts in the FD of ecosystems with climate change. Monitoring changes in FD and associated ecosystem functions requires a detailed understanding of FD, which we begin to develop in this study.","[Andrew, Samuel C.; Mokany, Karel] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Falster, Daniel S.; Wenk, Elizabeth] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Falster, Daniel S.; Wenk, Elizabeth] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Ian J.; Gallagher, Rachael, V] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Merow, Cory] Univ Connecticut, Eversource Energy Ctr, Storrs, CT USA; [Merow, Cory] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Adams, Vanessa] Univ Tasmania, Discipline Geog & Spatial Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Macquarie University; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; University of Tasmania,"Andrew, SC (autor correspondente), CSIRO, Land & Water, Acton, ACT, Australia.",sam.andrew@csiro.au,"Andrew, Samuel/J-6739-2019; Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009; Adams, Vanessa M./A-3834-2012; Wright, Ian/G-4979-2012","Andrew, Samuel/0000-0003-4589-2746; Adams, Vanessa M./0000-0002-3509-7901; Gallagher, Rachael/0000-0002-4680-8115; Wright, Ian/0000-0001-8338-9143; Wenk, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5640-5910; Falster, Daniel/0000-0002-9814-092X",Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship [DE170100208]; National Science Foundation [DBI-1913673],Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship(Australian Research Council); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship (DE170100208 to RVG) and National Science Foundation grant (DBI-1913673 to CM).,NA,80,14,14,5,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Our analyses revealed that neither plant diversity nor trophic complexity had significant effects on single functions, but trophic complexity altered the diversity-multifunctionality relationship in two key ways: It lowered the maximum strength of the diversity-multifunctionality effect, and it shifted the relationship between increasing diversity and multifunctionality from positive to negative at lower function thresholds.

One of the central issues affecting the functioning of ecosystems is the diversity of resident species richness and the composition of the plant community. However, one challenge to experimental studies is that results from artificial ecosystems may have little value for predicting loss of diversity and function degradation in natural ecosystems. Thus, recent studies have focused more on investigations of natural ecosystems; these studies have found that species diversity and ecosystem productivity usually correlate with various abiotic factors including environmental effects, such as soil nutrition and precipitation, as well as anthropic activities, such as grazing and agricultural yield. In this study, we aimed to test the validity of biotic factors reported in experimental studies to be major factors affecting the productivity of ecosystems, and then to determine whether the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is confounded by environmental factors. We investigated the effects of plant biodiversity and community composition on ecosystem function (productivity) in semiarid grassland in Inner Mongolia, China that contained three vegetation types: arid steppe, steppe, and meadow steppe. Our results show that both diversity and community composition significantly affect productivity and are better predictors of productivity than environmental factors, such as soil conditions. Our findings are consistent with the assumptions of niche complementarity. This study suggests that both biodiversity and community composition are important biotic factors in the functioning of ecosystems located in semiarid grasslands. In addition, environmental parameters, such as soil conditions influence productivity indirectly by affecting both biotic factors at the same time.","[Zheng, Xiao-Xuan; Liu, Guo-Hua; Fu, Bo-Jie; Jin, Tian-Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiao-Xuan; Jin, Tian-Tian] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhan-Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, S China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS","Liu, GH (autor correspondente), POB 2871, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",ghliu@rcees.ac.cn,"Liu, Zhanfeng/ABD-3933-2021; Fu, Bojie/B-1493-2009","Liu, Zhanfeng/0000-0002-6602-6196; ",National Basic Research Program of China [2009CB421104]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [40621061],National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was financially supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2009CB421104) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 40621061).

This may lead to critical changes in grasslands functioning. This is particularly important for grasslands in the Mediterranean Basin that have evolved in nutrient poor soils, and where more frequent and prolonged droughts are projected to occur. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the interacting effects of multiple nutrient inputs and rainfall variability on the plant functional structure and diversity of Mediterranean grasslands. We conducted a nutrient addition experiment in a Mediterranean grassland during four contrasting precipitation years. We established four treatments that varied in the number of added nutrients, from no added nutrients (control), to one added nutrient (Nitrogen-N, Phosphorus-P, or Potassium-K), two added nutrients, (NP, NK, or PK) and three added nutrients (NPK). We assessed the effect of increasing nutrient addition in wet, normal, dry, and very dry years on plant species functional traits at the community level. We determined the community functional structure (e.g., Community Weighted Mean, CWM) and functional diversity (e.g., Functional Dispersion, FDis) for eight key functional traits indicators of nutrient and water use strategies. We also assessed if CWM, FDis, and species richness were related to the aggregate grassland functioning property, i.e., productivity. We found that CWM was affected by nutrient addition and precipitation and, for some traits, by their interaction. However, FDis of most traits was affected by precipitation. The very dry year had a negative effect on FDis of most traits (e.g., dispersal modes, nutrient uptake strategies) and interacted with three added nutrients to decrease FDis of growth-forms. Conversely, FDis of reproductive traits decreased during the wet year. Species richness and FDis were not related to grassland productivity, whereas CWM was themain determinant of grassland productivity supporting the importance of species functional traits in determining ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight drought as a critical factor determining a decrease in the functional diversity of Mediterranean grasslands. Moreover, drought can also interact with nutrient addition changing the dominance of many traits and further decreasing functional diversity. This may have important implications for grasslands functioning in the context of global changes.","[Nogueira, Carla; Caldeira, Maria Conceicao] Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Forest Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Nunes, Alice; Branquinho, Cristina] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bugalho, Miguel N.] Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves CEABN InBIO, Lisbon, Portugal; [McCulley, Rebecca L.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Lexington, KY USA",Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; University of Kentucky,"Nogueira, C (autor correspondente), Univ Lisbon, Sch Agr, Forest Res Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal.",cnogueira@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Nogueira, Carla/A-2540-2019; Branquinho, Cristina/B-3670-2008; Caldeira, Maria/D-4107-2013; Nunes, Alice M.R./B-4817-2014; Bugalho, Miguel N/J-2993-2013; Caldeira, Maria/HPD-8762-2023","Nogueira, Carla/0000-0002-6581-1678; Branquinho, Cristina/0000-0001-8294-7924; Caldeira, Maria/0000-0002-3586-8526; Nunes, Alice M.R./0000-0002-6900-3838; Bugalho, Miguel N/0000-0002-7081-657X; ","Portuguese Science Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia-FCT) [IF/740/2014, PTDC/AAG-GLO/0045/2014, SFRH/BD/88650/2012, IF/1171/2014]; FCT, Portugal [UID/AGR/00239/2013]; FLAD/NSF [A1/Proj 124/12]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/88650/2012, PTDC/AAG-GLO/0045/2014] Funding Source: FCT","Portuguese Science Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia-FCT); FCT, Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FLAD/NSF; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Portuguese Science Foundation (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia-FCT), through the project IF/740/2014 and PTDC/AAG-GLO/0045/2014 and fellowships to CN (SFRH/BD/88650/2012) and MB (IF/1171/2014).

Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the fourth-corner problem. We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait-trait and trait-environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait-environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait-environment correlations and trait-trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.","[Sarker, Swapan Kumar; Reeve, Richard; Matthiopoulos, Jason] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sarker, Swapan Kumar] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh",University of Glasgow; Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST),"Reeve, R (autor correspondente), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Richard.Reeve@glasgow.ac.uk,"Reeve, Richard/K-9918-2015; Matthiopoulos, Jason/N-9808-2013","Reeve, Richard/0000-0003-2589-8091; Matthiopoulos, Jason/0000-0003-3639-8172; Sarker, Swapan Kumar/0000-0002-9933-0493","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom [BDCA-2013-6]; SUST Research Centre, Bangladesh [FES/2020/2/01]; BBSRC [BB/L004070/1, BB/ P004202/1]; University of Glasgow start-up fund; BBSRC [BB/P004202/1, BB/L004070/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom; SUST Research Centre, Bangladesh; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); University of Glasgow start-up fund; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","We are thankful to the editor and reviewers for suggestions that improved this manuscript.

We sowed plant communities with independent levels of functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversities (PD), combined with different levels of fertilization, to investigate their direct and indirect roles on multiple EFs, including plant-related EFs (plant biomass productivity, litter decomposability), soil fertility (organic carbon and nutrient pool variables), soil microbial activity (respiration and nutrient cycling), and an overall multifunctionality. We expected an increase in most EFs in communities with higher values of FD and/or PD via complementarity effects, but also the dominant plant types (using community weighted mean, CWM, independent of FD and PD) via selection effects on several EFs. The results showed strong direct effects of different dimensions of plant functional structure parameters on plant-related EFs, through either CWM or FD, with weak effects of PD. Fertilization had significant effects on one soil microbial activity and indirect effects on the other variables via changes in soil abiotic properties. Dominant plant types and FD showed only indirect effects on soil microbial activity, through litter decomposition and soil abiotic properties, highlighting the importance of cascading effects. This study shows the relevance of complementary dimensions of biodiversity for assessing both direct and cascading effects on multiple EFs.","[Valencia, Enrique] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Mostoles, Spain; [Galland, Thomas; Gotzenberger, Lars; Leps, Jan; de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Galland, Thomas; Gotzenberger, Lars] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Tiebon, Czech Republic; [Carmona, Carlos P.] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Goberna, Marta] INIA CSIC, Dept Environm & Agron, Madrid, Spain; [Leps, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Res Ctr, Inst Entomol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Verdu, Miguel; de Bello, Francesco] Ctr Invest Desertificac CSIC UV GV, Valencia, Spain; [Macek, Petr] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Res Ctr, Inst Hydrobiol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); Czech Academy of Sciences,"Valencia, E (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Mostoles, Spain.",valencia.gomez.e@gmail.com,"Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; Macek, Petr/AAK-7805-2020; Macek, Petr/F-5593-2011; Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Gotzenberger, Lars/H-1587-2014","Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Macek, Petr/0000-0002-4792-9461; Macek, Petr/0000-0002-4792-9461; Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Gotzenberger, Lars/0000-0003-3040-2900; Galland, Thomas/0000-0003-0883-8871",Community of Madrid; Rey Juan Carlos University [M2165]; Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky [GA20-13637S]; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship [626392]; Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+i [PGC2018-099027-B-I00]; Estonian Research Council [PSG293]; European Regional Development Fund via the Mobilitas Pluss programme [MOBERC40],Community of Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); Rey Juan Carlos University; Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship(European Commission); Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+i(Spanish Government); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); European Regional Development Fund via the Mobilitas Pluss programme,"Community of Madrid and Rey Juan Carlos University, Grant/Award Number: M2165; Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky, Grant/Award Number: GA20-13637S; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: 626392; Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+i, Grant/Award Number: PGC2018-099027-B-I00; Estonian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: PSG293; European Regional Development Fund via the Mobilitas Pluss programme, Grant/Award Number: MOBERC40",NA,88,1,1,31,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2022,103,12,,NA,,NA,,,e3833,10.1002/ecy.3833,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3833,NA,SEP 2022,15,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,6S4CV,35871447,Green Submitted,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000856502100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,Davi,sim,,sim,sim,sim,meadow,temperate,positiva,canopy_height;seedmass;SLA;LDMC;length_of_flowering_period;LNC;LPC;LCC;C:N;N:P;lifespan(annual/perennial);growth_form(erosulate/hemirosette/rosette);nitrogen-fixing_ability(present/absent),,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sim,,,,,,,,,,,PCA dos atributos e uso dos eixos como prediotres (eixo 1 = 43% e eixo 2 = 25.3%)

Traditionally, two sets of hypotheses based on the functional trait approach, niche complementarity (NC) and mass ratio (MR), have been proposed to explain the positive effects of biodiversity. Whereas NC emphasizes that functional discrepancy enhances the collective functioning of a given ecosystem, MR states that ecosystem functioning is mainly regulated by the functional traits of dominant species. This study explored the relative importance of these two hypotheses and the effects of forest stand and environmental characteristics on belowground biomass in an old-growth broad-leaved evergreen forest. The mean coarse-root biomass, fine-root biomass, and fine-root necromass were 117.78 +/- 54.000, 4.09 +/- 0.85, and 0.60 +/- 0.31 Mg.ha(-1), respectively. We found positive effects of functional diversity on belowground biomass; however, the community-weighted mean trait values were more relevant, indicating that MR exhibited more explanatory power than NC. The combination of informative environmental factors explained 62.0%, 53.2%, and 37.8% of the variation of coarse-root biomass, fine-root biomass, and fine-root necromass, respectively. Our results suggest that the functional identity of dominant tree species exerts more influence than functional diversity on the belowground biomass in old-growth forest ecosystems and that forest stand characteristics and topographic and edaphic factors also play important roles in shaping belowground biomass patterns in old-growth forest ecosystems.","[Xu, Yuanjie; Li, Wei; Gu, Xu; Guan, Zhenhua] Southwest Forestry Univ, Yunnan Acad Biodivers, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Li, Wei; Liu, Weiyi] Southwest Forestry Univ, Fac Forestry, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jie; Lu, Zhiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Menglun 666303, Peoples R China; [Lu, Zhiyun] Natl Forest Ecosyst Res Stn Ailao Mt, Jingdong 676200, Peoples R China","Southwest Forestry University - China; Lakehead University; Southwest Forestry University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS","Lu, ZY (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Menglun 666303, Peoples R China.;Lu, ZY (autor correspondente), Natl Forest Ecosyst Res Stn Ailao Mt, Jingdong 676200, Peoples R China.",luzy@xtbg.ac.cn,"Xu, Yuanjie/AAY-6068-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC31300454, 31760174]; Southwest Forestry University [SWFU111614]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Southwest Forestry University,"This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC31300454 and 31760174) and Southwest Forestry University (SWFU111614).

Here, the whole-plant traits, leaf morphological and physiological traits of two dominant species, Leymus chinensis (C-3 perennial rhizome grass) and Cleistogenes squarrosa (C-4 perennial bunchgrass), were studied in the Inner Mongolia grassland of China, with a grazing experiment including five stocking rates (0, 3.0, 4.5, 7.5, and 9.0 sheep/ha) in 2008 (wet year) and 2009 (dry year). Our results demonstrated that, for both species, the effects of stocking rate, year, and stocking rate x year on whole-plant traits and leaf morphological and physiological traits were highly significant in most cases. The differential responses of plant trait to variation in precipitation were caused by trait trade-offs between the wet and dry years. L. chinensis adopted the high N content and net photosynthetic rate (P-n) in the wet year but both the low N content and Pn in the dry year under grazed conditions. The trait trade-offs of C. squarrosa were characterized by high specific leaf area (SLA) and P-n in the dry year vs. low SLA and Pn in the wet year. Our findings also indicate that C. squarrosa is more resistant to grazing than L. chinensis in terms of avoidance and tolerance traits, particularly under heavy grazing pressure and in the dry year.","[Zheng, Shuxia; Lan, Zhichun; Li, Wenhuai; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Shao, Ruixin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Shan, Yumei] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm Sci, Hohhot 010018, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Wan, Hongwei; Taube, Friedhelm] Univ Kiel, Inst Crop Sci & Plant Breeding Grass & Forage Sci, D-24118 Kiel, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; University of Kiel","Bai, YF (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"Wan, Hongwei/C-4422-2011; Li, Wenhuai/A-1268-2015","Wan, Hongwei/0000-0002-1329-9553; Li, Wenhuai/0000-0002-1113-2020; Taube, Friedhelm/0000-0001-7175-2881","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30825008, 30900193]; State Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2009CB421102]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Basic Research Development Program of China,"We thank S.

However, we still have a poor understanding of the underlying physiological and ecological mechanisms driving diversity effects and how they may interact with soil nutrient availability. We collected data in a grassland experiment factorially manipulating fertilization, species richness (SR), functional composition (slow-growing vs. fast-growing species) and functional diversity in resource economic traits. We measured above-ground productivity (AP), nitrogen (N) uptake, photosynthesis and water use efficiency by combining a N-15 labelling approach with productivity, gas exchange and stable isotope measurements in 3 years differing in rainfall. We found that sown SR increased AP, N uptake and photosynthesis, suggesting that SR is the most important driver of ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling. Similarly, photosynthesis was affected by functional composition but not by functional diversity. Water use efficiency was reduced by sown SR for communities dominated by slow-growing species but not for communities dominated by fast-growing species. Fertilization increased productivity, N uptake and water use efficiency. The positive effects of high SR on ecosystem functions were independent of fertility levels. Synthesis. Our results provide evidence that high species richness in temperate grasslands could enhance productivity and reduce the negative impacts of drought events. Multiple factors and community characteristics are important in driving enhanced ecosystem functioning in biodiverse grasslands and seem to affect functioning and stability through different mechanisms.","[Walde, Manuel; Didion-Gency, Margaux; Gessler, Arthur; Lehmann, Marco M.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Ecosyst Ecol, Forest Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Allan, Eric; Cappelli, Seraina L.; Pichon, Noemie A.] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Allan, Eric] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Bern, Switzerland; [Cappelli, Seraina L.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, Helsinki, Finland; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pichon, Noemie A.] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol & Genet, Oulu, Finland; [Grossiord, Charlotte] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ecol Res Lab PERL, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Grossiord, Charlotte] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Community Ecol Unit, Funct Plant Ecol, Lausanne, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern; University of Bern; University of Helsinki; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Oulu; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research","Grossiord, C (autor correspondente), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ecol Res Lab PERL, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Grossiord, C (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Community Ecol Unit, Funct Plant Ecol, Lausanne, Switzerland.",charlotte.grossiord@epfl.ch,"Lehmann, Marco M./GXF-9430-2022; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Pichon, Noémie A./AAP-3412-2020; Walde, Manuel G./HGE-0197-2022; Allan, Eric/AAR-9566-2020; Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/AAP-3415-2020","Lehmann, Marco M./0000-0003-2962-3351; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Pichon, Noémie A./0000-0003-2972-1912; Walde, Manuel G./0000-0001-6344-3106; Allan, Eric/0000-0001-9641-9436; Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/0000-0002-8141-404X; Didion-Gency, Margaux/0000-0001-8967-3655; Grossiord, Charlotte/0000-0002-9113-3671","Swiss National Science Foundation SNF [PZ00P3_174068, PZ00P2_179978]; Sandoz Family Foundation",Swiss National Science Foundation SNF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Sandoz Family Foundation,"This study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation SNF (PZ00P3_174068 to C.G. and M.D.-G., and PZ00P2_179978 to M.M.L.).

We hypothesized that (1) diversity influences AGC through functional diversity and functional dominance effects; and (2) effects of diversity on AGC would be greater for functional dominance than for functional diversity. Community weight mean (CWM) of functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum plant height) were calculated to assess functional dominance (selection effects). As for functional diversity (complementarity effects), multitrait functional diversity indices were computed. The first hypothesis was tested using structural equation modeling. For the second hypothesis, effects of environmental variables such as slope and altitude were tested first, and separate linear mixed-effects models were fitted afterward for functional diversity, functional dominance, and both. Results showed that AGC varied significantly along the slope gradient, with lower values at steeper sites. Species diversity (richness) had positive relationship with AGC, even when slope effects were considered. As predicted, diversity effects on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, suggesting that both the niche complementarity and the selection effects are not exclusively affecting carbon storage. However, the effects were greater for functional diversity than for functional dominance. Furthermore, functional dominance effects were strongly transmitted by CWM of maximum plant height, reflecting the importance of forest vertical stratification for diversity-carbon relationship. We therefore argue for stronger complementary effects that would be induced also by complementary light-use efficiency of tree and species growing in the understory layer.","[Mensah, Sylvanus; Seifert, Thomas] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Matieland, South Africa; [Mensah, Sylvanus; Kakai, Romain Glele] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, Cotonou, Benin; [Veldtman, Ruan] Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Claremont, South Africa; [Veldtman, Ruan] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa; [Assogbadjo, Achille E.] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Ecol Appl, Cotonou, Benin",Stellenbosch University; University of Abomey Calavi; South African National Biodiversity Institute; Stellenbosch University; University of Abomey Calavi,"Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Matieland, South Africa.",sylvanus.m89@gmail.com,"Seifert, Thomas/AAF-2175-2019; Veldtman, Ruan/I-1131-2019; Seifert, Thomas/AAW-1576-2021","Seifert, Thomas/0000-0002-9611-6272; Mensah, Sylvanus/0000-0001-6838-749X; Glele Kakai, Romain/0000-0002-6965-4331",SHARE INTRA-ACP project; National Research Foundation of South Africa; African Forest Forum,SHARE INTRA-ACP project; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); African Forest Forum,SHARE INTRA-ACP project; National Research Foundation of South Africa; African Forest Forum,NA,65,67,73,13,106,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Despite this, several experimental and theoretical researches have shown inconsistencies in biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships, supporting either the niche complementarity or selection effect hypothesis. The relationship between species diversity, functional diversity, and aboveground biomass carbon was investigated in this study employing standing aboveground carbon (AGC) stock as a proxy measure for ecosystem function. We hypothesized that (i) effects of diversity on AGC can be transmitted through functional diversity and functional dominance; (ii) effects of diversity on AGC would be greater for functional dominance than functional diversity; and (iii) effects of functional diversity and functional dominance on carbon stock varied with metrics and functional traits. Community-weighted means (CWM) of functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum plant height) were calculated to assess functional dominance (selection effects). As for functional diversity (complementarity effects), multi-trait functional diversity (selection effects) indices were computed. We tested the first hypothesis using structural equation modeling. For the second hypothesis, the effects of environmental variables such as slope, aspect, and elevation were tested first, and separate linear mixed-effects models were fitted afterward for functional diversity, functional dominance, and the two together. Results Results revealed that slope had a significant effect on aboveground carbon storage. Functional diversity and functional dominance were significant predictors of the aboveground carbon storage (22.4%) in the dry evergreen Afromontane forest. The effects of species richness on aboveground carbon storage were mediated by functional diversity and functional dominance of species. This shows that both the selection effects and the niche complementarity are important for aboveground carbon storage prediction. However, the functional diversity effects (niche complementarity) were greater than functional dominance effects (selection effects). Conclusions Linking diversity and biodiversity components to aboveground carbon provides better insights into the mechanisms that explain variation in aboveground carbon storage in natural forests, which may help improve the prediction of ecosystem functions.","[Wondimu, Mengistu Teshome; Nigussie, Zebene Asfaw] Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Yusuf, Muktar Mohammed] Oda Bultum Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Chiro, Ethiopia",Hawassa University,"Wondimu, MT (autor correspondente), Hawassa Univ, Wondo Genet Coll Forestry & Nat Resources, Hawassa, Ethiopia.",menguteshe2012@gmail.com,,,"Oda Bultum University, Ethiopia","Oda Bultum University, Ethiopia","We obtained funding for this research from Oda Bultum University, Ethiopia.",NA,87,3,3,8,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2192-1709,,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

Functional traits and phylogeny offer different, and often complementary, information about ecological differences between species, an essential step to uncover biodiversity assembly mechanisms and their feedbacks to ecosystem functions. However, traits and phylogeny are often related due to underlying trait evolution. Consequently, when combined, their shared information can be overemphasized, hindering their complementarity. It is therefore desirable to decouple their unique and overlapping contributions. 2. We propose a conceptual and mathematical framework that produces a set of meaningful measures of ecological differences between species. 3. We test the properties of these measures and the validity of the approach with extensive simulated data to show (i) the information provided by decoupling traits from phylogeny and vice versa, and (ii) that decoupling trait and phylogenetic information can uncover otherwise hidden signals underlying species coexistence and turnover. The application of the approach is further illustrated using a large dataset of Central European meadows as a case study. 4. Decoupling traits and phylogeny particularly reveals the importance of differentiation between phylogenetically related species, which can be essential to understand species replacements along environmental gradients and the combined action of environmental filtering and limiting similarity within communities. 5. Decoupling traits and phylogeny provides an avenue for connecting macro-evolutionary and local factors affecting coexistence and for understanding how complex species differences affect multiple ecosystem functions. We present an R function called 'decouple', which allows a simple and wide application of the framework.","[de Bello, Francesco; Carmona, Carlos Perez] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Zlate Stoce 1, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco; Gotzenberger, Lars] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dukelska 135, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Smilauer, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre F.] Univ Fed Goias, UFG, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Ecol, CAMPUS 2, BR-74670970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Lososova, Zdenka] Masaryk Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CZ-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Herben, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Herben, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, CZ-12801 Prague 2, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Universidade Federal de Goias; Masaryk University Brno; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"de Bello, F (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Zlate Stoce 1, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.;de Bello, F (autor correspondente), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dukelska 135, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic.",fradebello@prf.jcu.cz,"Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016; Diniz-Filho, José Alexandre Felizola/D-9405-2013; Herben, Tomas/G-1804-2014; Šmilauer, Petr/N-8313-2019; Lososová, Zde?ka/U-6141-2019; Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; Götzenberger, Lars/H-1587-2014; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022","Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Diniz-Filho, José Alexandre Felizola/0000-0002-0967-9684; Herben, Tomas/0000-0002-6636-0012; Šmilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Lososová, Zde?ka/0000-0001-9152-7462; Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; Götzenberger, Lars/0000-0003-3040-2900; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198",Czech Science Foundation [GA16-15012S]; Brazilian CAPES PVE grant [88881.068053/2014-01]; European Union's FP7 [GA-2010-267243 - PLANT FELLOWS]; Center of Excellence PLADIAS [GACR-14-36079G]; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within European Union's FP7 (TANDEM) [626392],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Brazilian CAPES PVE grant; European Union's FP7; Center of Excellence PLADIAS; Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within European Union's FP7 (TANDEM),"We thank Norman Mason, Tamara M unkemuller, Evan Weiher and one anonymous referee for the constructive comments on the manuscript and Genevieve Finerty for improving theEnglish.

While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in cornplementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.","[Craven, Dylan; Bruelheide, Helge; Roscher, Christiane; Weigelt, Alexandra; Thakur, Madhav P.; Vogel, Anja; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Craven, Dylan; Weigelt, Alexandra; Thakur, Madhav P.; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Johannisallee 21, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Isbell, Forest; Seabloom, Eric; Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Manning, Pete] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland; [Manning, Pete] Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Connolly, John] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Ecol & Environm Modelling Grp, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Ebeling, Anne] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Dornburger Str 159, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [van Ruijven, Jasper] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wilsey, Brian] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Beierkuhnlein, Carl] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [de Luca, Enrica; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Griffin, John N.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Ecol & Biodivers Grp, Padualaan 8, NL-3584 Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hector, Andy] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RB, England; [Jentsch, Anke] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Disturbance Ecol, BayCEER, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Kreyling, Juergen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Lanta, Vojtech] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Univ Toulouse 3, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Meyer, Sebastian T.; Vogel, Anja] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Mori, Akira S.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Naeem, Shahid] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Palmborg, Cecilia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr Res Northern Sweden, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Polley, H.

This hypothesis has received much less support when based on functional trait diversity and when tested in complex natural forests. Here, we hypothesized that niche complementarity (high trait diversity) in the understorey and niche overlap (low trait diversity) in the overstorey would drive whole-community aboveground biomass. To test this hypothesis, we used multiple linear regression models to evaluate how functional trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) of overstorey, understorey, and whole community determine aboveground biomass across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest of Eastern China. A structural equation model was used to evaluate whether the functional trait diversity of overstorey affects the relationships between understorey functional trait diversity and whole-community aboveground biomass while considering for the effect of environmental factors. We additionally considered the effects of mass ratio (i.e. community-weighted mean of trait values) and stand structural complexity. The strong negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the functional dominance and/or niche overlap rather than niche complementarity effect. The negative effect of overstorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass was also partially mediated by its direct negative effect on understorey functional evenness. The weak positive effect of understorey functional evenness on aboveground biomass provides support to the niche complementarity effect. We conclude that functional evenness of overstorey and understorey strata affect whole-community aboveground biomass differently through opposing mechanisms, regardless of the effects of mass ratio and stand structural complexity.","[Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] South China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Spatial Ecol Lab, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lohbeck, Madelon] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon] ICRAF, World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave, Nairobi, Kenya; [Yan, En-Rong] IEC, 3663 N Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; South China Normal University; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Yan, ER (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Yan, ER (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",arshadforester@m.scnu.edu.cn; madelon.lohbeck@wur.nl; eryan@des.ecnu.edu.cn,"Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; ER, Yan/HLX-3797-2023; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770467, 31670438]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to thank Min Guo, Qiang Zhong, Meng Kang, Yue Xu, Yilu Xu, Xiaodong Yang, Haixia Huang, Zhihao Zhang, Baowei Sun, Wenji Ma, Qingru Shi, Yantao, Zhao, Qingqing Zhang, Mingshan Xu, and Liuli Zhou for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

We aimed to clarify such impacts by testing for differences in ecosystem productivity and multiple community metrics in response to fertilization. We established plots in 2015 consisting of control (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen + phosphorus (NP) treatments in a mid-Atlantic coastal grassland. In 2017 we collected aboveground biomass, functional traits, and species abundance for each plot. Our findings indicate a synergistic co-limitation, such that NP plots were more productive than all other treatments. A combination of traits responsible for competition and nutrient uptake (i.e., height and delta N-15) caused trait-based divergence of N and NP plots from C and P plots. Functional trait-based composition patterns differed from species composition and lifeform abundance patterns, highlighting complexities of community response to nutrient enrichment. While trait-based functional alpha-diversity did not differ among nutrient treatments, it was positively correlated with biomass production, suggesting nutrients may impact functional alpha-diversity indirectly through increased productivity. Increased functional alpha-diversity could be a mechanism of co-existence emerging as productivity increases. These results have important implications for understanding how plant communities in low-productivity coastal systems are altered by fertilization.","[Brown, Joseph K.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Integrat Life Sci Doctoral Program, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Brown, Joseph K.; Zinnert, Julie C.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Zinnert, JC (autor correspondente), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",brownjk5@vcu.edu; jczinnert@vcu.edu,,"Zinnert, Julie/0000-0003-2578-7236; Brown, Joseph/0000-0002-3828-4729",National Science Foundation [1237733]; Virginia Commonwealth University,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Virginia Commonwealth University,"This research was funded by National Science Foundation, grant number 1237733 and Virginia Commonwealth University.",NA,82,1,1,5,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,NA,,,19,10.3390/d13010019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13010019,NA,,15,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PX0RK,NA,gold,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000611072400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, beyond the simple effects of plant species richness, little is known about how plant diversity and its loss influence higher trophic levels, which are crucial to the functioning of many species-rich ecosystems. We analyzed to what extent woody plant phylogenetic diversity and species richness contribute to explaining the biomass and abundance of herbivorous and predatory arthropods in a species-rich forest in subtropical China. The biomass and abundance of leaf-chewing herbivores, and the biomass dispersion of herbivores within plots, increased with woody plant phylogenetic diversity. Woody plant species richness had much weaker effects on arthropods, but interacted with plant phylogenetic diversity to negatively affect the ratio of predator to herbivore biomass. Overall, our results point to a strong bottom-up control of functionally important herbivores mediated particularly by plant phylogenetic diversity, but do not support the general expectation that top-down predator effects increase with plant diversity. The observed effects appear to be driven primarily by increasing resource diversity rather than diversity-dependent primary productivity, as the latter did not affect arthropods. The strong effects of plant phylogenetic diversity and the overall weaker effects of plant species richness show that the diversity-dependence of ecosystem processes and interactions across trophic levels can depend fundamentally on non-random species associations. This has important implications for the regulation of ecosystem functions via trophic interaction pathways and for the way species loss may impact these pathways in species-rich forests.","[Schuldt, Andreas; Assmann, Thorsten] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Baruffol, Martin] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Chen, Simon] Univ Cambridge Magdalene Coll, Cambridge CB3 0AG, England; [Chi, Xiulian] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chi, Xiulian] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wall, Marcus] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Zurich; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Cambridge; Peking University; Peking University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Schuldt, A (autor correspondente), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",schuldt@uni.leuphana.de,"Chen, Simon/AFM-3288-2022; Assmann, Thorsten/Q-9304-2017; Chi, Xiulian/A-8898-2015; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Schuldt, Andreas/J-9429-2013; Baruffol, Martin/A-2406-2014","Assmann, Thorsten/0000-0002-9203-769X; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schuldt, Andreas/0000-0002-8761-0025; Baruffol, Martin/0000-0001-9358-5885","German Research Foundation [DFG FOR 891/1, 891/2]; Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion in Beijing [GZ 524, 592, 698, 699, 785, 1,020]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC 30710103907, 30930005]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion in Beijing; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank the administration of the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve and members of the BEF China consortium for support, Stefan Michalski and Walter Durka for providing woody plant phylogenetic data, and Daria Golub, Merle Noack, and Friederike Rorig for help with arthropod sampling.

For a potentially unlimited number of clonal plant populations, it explicitly simulates competition for two key resources (light and nitrogen) along vertical canopy and soil profiles. Population turnover, shoot and root morphogenesis, photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, N acquisition by uptake, allocation of assimilates between structural compartments, and reserve storage and remobilization, are simulated for each plant population. The object-oriented structure of the modeling framework allows to couple, or not, the simulated plant populations to other sub-models describing climate variables, soil functioning, grazing behavior and grassland management. Partitioning of growth between shoot structures, leaf photosynthetic proteins and roots is based on two assumptions: (i) functional balance between root and shoot activity, (ii) coordination of leaf photosynthesis. The model was parameterized from plant functional trait measurements of 13 native perennial pasture grass species grown in monocultures at high N availability and low cutting frequency in a field trial. Predicted and measured annual dry-matter yields were highly correlated without bias across species, N supply and cutting frequency treatments in monocultures and in mixtures of six species. Results show the ability of this mechanistic model to simulate without bias nitrogen and disturbance responses of net primary productivity and of plant community structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We established a five-year experiment using three grass species with different nutrient addition and mowing treatments to explore overyielding and species interactions. We found strong overyielding caused by trait-independent complementarity effects. Nutrient addition increased overyielding via increasing trait-independent complementarity effects whereas mowing eliminated overyielding. One possible mechanism underlying the responses observed is the changes of positive aboveground species interactions. This result is consistent with the considerable literature identifying facilitation in alpine ecosystems by which coexisting plant species improve the microclimate and thereby promote the performance of all species. Complimentary resource use and selection effect have been demonstrated frequently as the mechanisms driving overyielding in grasslands. However, as we identify here, and positive interactions may be especially important in driving overyielding and positive interactions may be especially important in stressful environments such as alpine grasslands.","[Yin, Xin; Qi, Wei; Du, GuoZhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, South Tianshui Rd 222, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Knops, Johannes M.

There are two competing hypotheses: the biomass ratio' hypothesis, where biomass is influenced by the abundance and traits of the most dominant species, and the diversity' hypothesis, where the diversity of organisms influences biomass through mechanisms such as niche complementarity. However, no studies have tested which one of these two hypotheses better explains the variation in plant biomass in the forest understorey. LocationTemperate deciduous forests in northern France. MethodsFor the forest understorey, we assessed species diversity and biomass as well as soil and light conditions in 133 forest plots of 100m(2) each. Using mixed-effect models and after controlling for potential confounding factors, we tested the biomass ratio' hypothesis by relating the relative abundance of the most dominant species across our study sites and the CWM of plant traits (leaf area and plant height) to biomass. The diversity' hypothesis was tested by relating biomass to various measures of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. ResultsBiomass of the forest understorey was mainly related to the relative abundance and the trait values of the most dominant species, supporting the biomass ratio' hypothesis. In contrast to the diversity' hypothesis, functional diversity indices had a negative impact on biomass. We found no contribution of taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity indices. ConclusionThe abundance and traits of the most dominant species matter more than taxonomic, functional or phylogenetic diversity of the forest understorey in explaining its biomass. Thus, there is a need for experiments that aim to fully understand keystone species' responses to on-going changing biotic and abiotic conditions and to predict their effects on ecosystem functioning and processes.","[Wasof, Safaa; Lenoir, Jonathan; Hattab, Tarek; Jamoneau, Aurelien; Gallet-Moron, Emilie; Saguez, Robert; Bennsadek, Lamine; Valdes, Alicia; Decocq, Guillaume] Jules Verne Univ Picardie, Unite Rech Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EDYSAN, UMR 7058, Amiens 1, France; [Wasof, Safaa; Ampoorter, Evy; Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Dept Forest & Water Management, Forest & Nat Lab ForNaLab, Gontrode, Belgium; [Hattab, Tarek] IFREMER UMR 248 MARBEC, Sete, France; [Jamoneau, Aurelien] IRSTEA, Unite Rech Ecosyst Aquat & Changements Globaux EA, Cestas, France; [Bertrand, Romain] Paul Sabatier Univ, CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Ecol Stn,UMR CNRS 5321, Moulis, France; [Valdes, Alicia] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden",Ghent University; Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Stockholm University,"Wasof, S (autor correspondente), Jules Verne Univ Picardie, Unite Rech Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises EDYSAN, UMR 7058, Amiens 1, France.",Safaa.wasof@ugent.be,"Lenoir, Jonathan/AAE-8441-2019; Jamoneau, Aurélien/AAD-1659-2019","Lenoir, Jonathan/0000-0003-0638-9582; Jamoneau, Aurélien/0000-0003-1181-2269; Bertrand, Romain/0000-0003-2386-9174; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108",Syrian Ministry of Higher Education; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; European Research Council [614839],Syrian Ministry of Higher Education; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"Syrian Ministry of Higher Education; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-41; European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 614839",NA,75,21,24,12,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

While functional differences between species can explain species richness effects, empirical evidence regarding functional differences between genotypes within species and potential consequences for productivity is largely lacking. We therefore measured within- and among-species variation in functional traits and growth and determined stand-level tree biomass in a large forest experiment factorially manipulating species and genetic richness in subtropical China. Within-species variation across genetic seed families, in addition to variation across species, explained a substantial amount of trait variation. Furthermore, trait responses to species and genetic richness varied significantly within and between species. Multivariate trait variation was larger among individuals from species mixtures than those from species monocultures, but similar among individuals from genetically diverse vs genetically uniform monocultures. Correspondingly, species but not genetic richness had a positive effect on stand-level tree biomass. We argue that identifying functional diversity within and among species in forest communities is necessary to separate effects of species and genetic diversity on tree growth and community productivity.","[Bongers, Franca J.; Li, Shan; Yan, Haoru; Ma, Keping; Liu, Xiaojuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich 8057, Switzerland; [Durka, Walter; Hahn, Christoph Z.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, Halle 06120, Germany; [Durka, Walter; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, Leipzig 04103, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Hahn, Christoph Z.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England; [Yan, Haoru] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; University of Zurich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Liverpool; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Ma, KP; Liu, XJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",kpma@ibcas.ac.cn; liuxiaquan06@ibcas.ac.cn,"Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Bongers, Franca J./AAO-6769-2021; Durka, Walter/E-4667-2010","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Bongers, Franca J./0000-0001-9517-4932; Durka, Walter/0000-0002-6611-2246; Hahn, Christoph/0000-0002-8399-4682; Ma, Keping/0000-0001-9112-5340; Yan, Haoru/0000-0002-6016-0300",BEF-China research group; Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870409]; National Science and Technology Ministry Major Project [2017YFA0605103]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2019082]; German Research Foundation [DFG FOR 891]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB),BEF-China research group; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Ministry Major Project; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB),"We acknowledge the support of the BEF-China research group, especially many students and local helpers involved in setting up the plots and collecting the numerous data.

In this context, we conducted an N-15 field study in three. different grasslands, testing complementarity nitrogen (N) uptake patterns in terms of space, time, and chemical form as well as N strategies such as soil N use, symbiotic N fixation, or internal N recycling for different plant species. The relative contribution of different spatial, temporal, and chemical soil N pools to total soil N uptake of plants varied significantly among the investigated plant species, within and across functional groups. This suggests that plants occupy distinct niches with respect to their relative N uptake. However, when the absolute N uptake from the different soil N pools was analyzed, no spatial, temporal, or chemical variability was detected, but plants, and in particular functional groups, differed significantly with respect to their total soil N uptake irrespective of treatment. Consequently, our data suggest that absolute N exploitation on the ecosystem level is determined by species or functional group identity and thus by community composition rather than by complementary biodiversity effects. Across functional groups, total N uptake from the soil was negatively correlated with leaf N concentrations, suggesting that these functional groups follow different N use strategies to meet their N demands. While our findings give no evidence for a biodiversity effect on the quantitative exploitation of different soil N pools, there is evidence for different and complementary N strategies and thus a potentially beneficial effect of functional group diversity on ecosystem functioning.","Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; Univ Leipzig, Inst Bot, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Max Planck Society; Leipzig University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Kahmen, A (autor correspondente), ETH Zentrum, Inst Plant Sci, LFW C55, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ansgar.kahmen@ipw.agrl.ethz.ch,"Kahmen, Ansgar/AAC-4899-2019; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Unsicker, Sybille B./AAW-6968-2021","Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Unsicker, Sybille B./0000-0002-9738-0075",,,,NA,46,180,187,5,173,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2006,87,5,,,,NA,1244,1255,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1244:NCFNAE]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1244:NCFNAE]2.0.CO;2,NA,,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,042TM,16761603,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000237552400020,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quantity and quality of these inputs is determined by the identity of the plants involved. Yet substantial uncertainty surrounds the complex relationships among plant traits and soil C, precluding efforts to maximize whole-ecosystem C uptake in nature-based climate mitigation scenarios. In this study, we leveraged a biodiversity-ecosystem function experiment with trees (IDENT) to explore the effects of interspecific variation in plant traits on soil C dynamics in the very early stages of stand development (9 years since planting). Mineral soil C stocks to 5 cm depth were quantified in monospecific plots of 19 tree species planted on a former agricultural field, and analyzed in relation to tree growth and functional traits. We found that tree species identity affected soil bulk density and, to a lesser extent, the carbon content of the topsoil, and thereby total C pools. Among species and across plots, mineral soil C stocks were positively correlated with rates of tree growth and were significantly larger beneath broadleaf trees with fast functional traits vs. conifers with more conservative leaf traits, when comparisons were made over equivalent soil depth increments. Thus, plant functional traits mediate interspecific differences in productivity, which in turn influence the magnitude of belowground C stocks. These results highlight important linkages between above- and belowground carbon cycles in the earliest stages of afforestation.","[Waring, Bonnie G.; Smith, Kenneth R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Waring, Bonnie G.; Smith, Kenneth R.] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Belluau, Michael; Khlifa, Rim; Messier, Christian; Paquette, Alain] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Temperate Forest Sci, Ctr Forest Res CEF, Dept Nat Resources, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Munson, Alison] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Ctr Etud Foret, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Waring, Bonnie G.] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Life Sci, London, England",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Natural Resources Canada; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Laval University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London,"Waring, BG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Waring, BG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Waring, BG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Dept Life Sci, London, England.",bonnie.waring@gmail.com,,,,,,NA,55,0,0,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-893X,,FRONT FOR GLOB CHANG,Front.

This type of indirect facilitation impacts species coexistence and ecosystem functioning in a large array of ecosystems worldwide. It has nonetheless generally been understudied so far in comparison with the role played by direct facilitation among plants. We aimed at providing original data on indirect facilitation at the community scale to determine the extent to which indirect facilitation mediated by grazers can shape plant communities. Such experimental data are expected to contribute to refining the conceptual framework on plant-plant-herbivore interactions in stressful environments. We set up a 2-year grazing exclusion experiment in tropical alpine peatlands in Bolivia. Those ecosystems depend entirely on a few, structuring cushion-forming plants (hereafter referred to as nurse species), in which associated plant communities develop. Fences have been set over two nurse species with different strategies to cope with grazing (direct vs. indirect defenses), which are expected to lead to different intensities of indirect facilitation for the associated communities. We collected functional traits which are known to vary according to grazing pressure (LDMC, leaf thickness, and maximum height), on both the nurse and their associated plant communities in grazed (and therefore indirect facilitation as well) and ungrazed conditions. We found that the effect of indirectly facilitated on the associated plant communities depended on the functional trait considered. Indirect facilitation decreased the effects of grazing on species relative abundance, mean LDMC, and the convergence of the maximum height distribution of the associated communities, but did not affect mean height or cover. The identity of the nurse species and grazing jointly affected the structure of the associated plant community through indirect facilitation. Our results together with the existing literature suggest that the grazer-nurse-beneficiary interaction module can be more complex than expected when evaluated in the field.","[Danet, Alain; Anthelme, Fabien] Univ Montpellier, INRA, CIRAD, IRD,CNRS,AMAP, Montpellier, France; [Danet, Alain; Kefi, Sonia] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, IRD, CNRS,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Meneses, Rosa I.; Anthelme, Fabien] Herbario Nacl Bolivia, Museo Nacl Hist Nat, La Paz, Bolivia; [Meneses, Rosa I.; Anthelme, Fabien] Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Ecol, La Paz, Bolivia",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universidad Mayor de San Andres,"Danet, A (autor correspondente), Univ Montpellier, INRA, CIRAD, IRD,CNRS,AMAP, Montpellier, France.",alain.danet@umontpellier.fr,"Danet, Alain/AFM-0892-2022","Danet, Alain/0000-0002-1592-9483; Kefi, Sonia/0000-0002-9678-7770; Meneses, Rosa Isela/0000-0001-8779-2757",Fond Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM); Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB) [AAP-SCEN-2011-II],Fond Francais pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM); Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB),"We thank Mary Carolina Garcia Lino, Ariel Lliully, Arthur Sanguet, Marine Segond, and Pierre Vincent for their invaluable help in the field, and we are grateful to Marine Segond for her help with the leaf analysis.

Between-species variation in nutrient resorption is one of the mechanisms explaining the positive relationship between biodiversity and primary productivity. Yet, the role of within-species variations in nutrient resorption in mediating the relationship between biodiversity and productivity remains unclear. 2. We examined how within-species nutrient resorption, and ultimately productivity, respond to changes in species richness by using four traits related to nitrogen and phosphorus use in four dominant species from different plant functional groups in a biodiversity removal experiment in the temperate steppe. 3. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in both green and senesced leaves in all species significantly decreased with increasing plant species richness, suggesting that plants used those limiting nutrients more efficiently with increasing biodiversity. Plants in higher diversity communities resorbed more nutrients during senescence, which may facilitate reproduction and vegetative regrowth in the next year. 4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of considering within-species variation in nutrient resorption as an important underlying mechanism explaining the positive effects of biodiversity on primary productivity and ecosystem carbon accumulation.","[Lu, Xiao-Tao; Hu, Yan-Yu; Han, Xing-Guo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yan-Yu; Han, Xing-Guo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wolf, Amelia A.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Han, Xing-Guo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Lu, XT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",lvxiaotao@iae.ac.cn,"Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016","Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31822006, 31770503]; National Basic Research Program of China [2016YFC0500601, 2015CB150802]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB15010403, XDA23070103]; CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC006]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2014174]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31822006 and 31770503; National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC0500601 and 2015CB150802; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB15010403 and XDA23070103; Key Research Program from CAS, Grant/Award Number: QYZDB-SSW-DQC006; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS,Grant/Award Number: 2014174",NA,28,25,28,11,195,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Yet, most of studies of leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chl) have typically been limited to few species or sites, and there has been little understanding of its variation among species of contrasting environments, or across forests differing in gross primary productivity (GPP). We measured mass-based foliar Chl concentrations (Chl a, Chl b, and total Chl) for 937 species of nine Chinese forests ranging from tropical to cold-temperate regions. Total Chl varied by over ten-fold from 1.45 to 19.2 mg g(-1) (mean: 5.54 mg g(-1)), and differed among plant functional groups. At the community level, total Chl decreased with increasing latitude. The ratio of Chl a/b decreased from trees to shrubs to herbs, consistent with adaptation to contrasting irradiance, i.e., overstory vs. understory. Total Chl was positively related to leaf N and P concentrations, as would be expected to optimize photosynthesis and carbon fixation. Across forests, GPP was positively correlated with community-averaged Chl (r = 0.57; P < 0.01), a new case of a linkage between leaf traits and ecosystem function at regional to continental scale. Our findings revealed variation in Chl from tropical to cold-temperate forests, and the linkage of leaf Chl with ecosystem function, enhancing our ability to parameterize vegetation models.","[Li, Ying; Wu, Xiuqin; Hou, Jihua] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; Yang, Hao; Xu, Li; Wang, Qiufeng; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; Yang, Hao; Xu, Li; Wang, Qiufeng; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sack, Lawren] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Northeast Normal University - China","Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",houjihua@bjfu.edu.cn,"wang, qiufeng/C-1654-2013; Sack, Lawren/A-5492-2008","Sack, Lawren/0000-0002-7009-7202","Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC0504004, 2016YFC0500202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31000263, 611606015, 31290221]; STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFJ-SW-STS-167]; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project [LENOM2016Q0005]",Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences; program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project,"This work was supported by the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2017YFC0504004, 2016YFC0500202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31000263, 611606015, 31290221), STS of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KFJ-SW-STS-167), and the program of Youth Innovation Research Team Project (LENOM2016Q0005).",NA,48,42,51,6,67,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

A plant community's ability to exploit such limiting resources may be better represented by functional diversity than species or phylogenetic diversity, and may therefore have the higher predictive power regarding how soil phosphorus influences AGB in tropical forests. However, nearly no studies have tested this in tropical high-altitude forest ecosystems. Here we aim to test: 1) the relative influence of three biodiversity metrics (functional diversity, species diversity, and phylogenetic diversity) on aboveground biomass in a tropical cloud forest and 2) the interrelationships among soil phosphorus, biodiversity, and AGB in this ecosystem. Methods In a tropical cloud forest in Hainan Island, China, we measured 13 key functional traits for 195 species in 48 plots of size 20 x 20 m(2) each. We also measured soil phosphorus in all plots and computed the community phylogeny. Using this dataset, we tested the interrelationships among soil phosphorus, species diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and AGB using Generalized Additive Modeling and Redundancy Analysis. Results Functional diversity was significantly positively related to AGB, whereas species diversity and phylogenetic diversity were not significantly related to AGB. Functional diversity explained 53% of AGB, while species diversity and phylogenetic diversity only explained 17% and 6%, respectively. Soil phosphorus explained 56% of the variation in functional diversity, but only explained 22%, 13% and 21% of the variation in species diversity, phylogenetic diversity and AGB, respectively. Conclusions Functional diversity, rather than species and phylogenetic diversity, are the better predictors of AGB. The influence of functional diversity on AGB appears to be linked to how variation in soil phosphorus affects functional diversity. We suggest that functional diversity should be incorporated into models that are designed to test how soil resources influence ecosystem function in tropical forest ecosystems.","[Cheng, Yikang; Zhang, Hui; Long, Wenxing; Wang, Xu] Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yikang; Zhang, Hui; Long, Wenxing] Hainan Univ, Minist Educ Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Specia, Key Lab, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Yikang; Zhang, Hui; Long, Wenxing] Hainan Univ, Inst Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Zang, Runguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Zang, Runguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xixi] Fairy Lake Bot Garden, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xixi] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen 518004, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Menghui] Agr & Rural Bur Pengshan Dist, Meishan 620820, Peoples R China; [John, Robert] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Dept Biol Sci, Mohanpur Campus, Kolkata 741246, W Bengal, India","Hainan University; Hainan University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Kolkata","Long, WX (autor correspondente), Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",oklong@hainanu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31660163, 31870508, 31260109]; Innovative Research Team grant of the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province [2016CXTD003]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovative Research Team grant of the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31660163, 31870508 and 31260109), and the Innovative Research Team grant of the Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province (2016CXTD003).",NA,82,9,9,19,71,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,APR,2020,449,1-fev.,,,,NA,51,63,,10.1007/s11104-020-04421-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04421-7,NA,FEB 2020,13,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,LH5MP,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000516045300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nurse plants should preferentially promote the coexistence of ecologically dissimilar species with little niche overlap, and if ecological traits are conserved within evolutionary lineages, this should result in phylogenetic overdispersion. In contrast to competition, facilitation is expected to increase species richness. Therefore, to examine the role of facilitation as a driver of plant assemblages in Caatinga, we quantified the functional traits of nurse species and compared species richness, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic structure of the tree layer and of the herbaceous layer between patchy Caatinga and Caatinga with segregated plants. Results show that functional traits related to resilience and resistance against herbivory seem to be crucial for facilitation in Caatinga. Autochory occurs at a higher frequency in nurse plants than in Caatinga in general. The herbaceous layer of patchy Caatinga is richer in species than of Caatinga with segregated plants, and facilitation is the suggested cause. As the whole community of the 196 patches is phylogenetically overdispersed compared to the null expectations, facilitation seems to predominantly promote the coexistence of dissimilar species with little niche overlap.

Current theoretical approaches to modeling ecosystem response to environmental change often deal only with single environmental drivers or single species traits, simple ecological interactions, and/or steady states, leading to concern about how accurately these approaches will capture future responses to environmental change in real biological systems. To begin addressing this issue, we generalize a previous trait-based framework to incorporate aspects of frequency dependence, functional complementarity, and the dynamics of systems composed of species that are defined by multiple traits that are tied to multiple environmental drivers. The framework is particularly well suited for analyzing the role of temporal environmental fluctuations in maintaining trait variability and the resultant effects on community response to environmental change. Using this framework, we construct simple models to investigate two ecological problems. First, we show how complementary resource use can significantly enhance the nutrient uptake of plant communities through two different mechanisms related to increased productivity (over-yielding) and larger trait variability. Over-yielding is a hallmark of complementarity and increases the total biomass of the community and, thus, the total rate at which nutrients are consumed. Trait variability also increases due to the lower levels of competition associated with complementarity, thus speeding up the rate at which more efficient species emerge as conditions change. Second, we study systems in which multiple environmental drivers act on species defined by multiple, correlated traits. We show that correlations in these systems can increase trait variability within the community and again lead to faster responses to environmental change. The methodological advances provided here will apply to almost any function that relates species traits and environmental drivers to growth, and should prove useful for studying the effects of climate change on the dynamics of biota.

However, such studies typically assume that phylogenetic branches of equivalent length are more or less interchangeable. Here we suggest that there is a need to consider not only branch lengths but also their placement on the phylogeny. We demonstrate how two common indices of network centrality can be used to describe the evolutionary distinctiveness of network elements (nodes and branches) on a phylogeny. If phylogenetic diversity enhances ecosystem function via complementarity and the representation of functional diversity, we would predict a correlation between evolutionary distinctiveness of network elements and their contribution to ecosystem process. In contrast, if one or a few evolutionary innovations play key roles in ecosystem function, the relationship between evolutionary distinctiveness and functional contribution may be weak or absent. We illustrate how network elements associated with high functional contribution can be identified from regressions between phylogenetic diversity and productivity using a well-known empirical data set on plant productivity from the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research. We find no association between evolutionary distinctiveness and ecosystem functioning, but we are able to identify phylogenetic elements associated with species of known high functional contribution within the Fabaceae. Our perspective provides a useful guide in the search for ecological traits linking diversity and ecosystem function, and suggests a more nuanced consideration of phylogenetic diversity is required in the conservation and biodiversity-ecosystem-function literature.","[Davies, T.

The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45% of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the 'main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse 'High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We examined the mechanisms underlying changes in primary productivity following experimental species loss scenarios in Mongolian grassland. The range of species loss scenarios was based on natural patterns of species abundance that reflect the species' contributions to ecosystem processes. We found a clear reduction in productivity due to species loss only when species were lost randomly. Grassland productivity was relatively robust following nonrandom species loss scenarios. Even in the context of density compensation, the decrease in dominant trait values for leaf height would explain the reduction in productivity with random species loss. In contrast, the maintenance of dominant trait values of key productivity traits such as leaf dry matter content and leaf height might contribute to the maintenance of productivity in response to nonrandom species loss. Our experiment demonstrated that the responses and mechanisms of primary productivity to species loss differ according to the scenarios of species loss in natural grassland communities. The effects of diversity on productivity might be weak in mature natural systems when species loss is nonrandom. Understanding the consequences of realistic species loss on ecosystem functioning based on field-based removal experiments will give insights into real conservation strategies in the face of global biodiversity change.","[Sasaki, Takehiro] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan; [Yoshihara, Yu; Takahashi, Masaya; Futahashi, Risa; Suyama, Yoshihisa] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, 232-3 Yomogida, Osaki, Miyagi 9896711, Japan; [Byambatsetseg, Lkhagvasuren; Nyambayar, Dashzeveg] Natl Univ Mongolia, Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Biol, Zaluuchuudiin Urgun Chuluu-1,POB 377, Ulaanbaatar 210646, Mongolia",Yokohama National University; Tohoku University; National University of Mongolia,"Sasaki, T (autor correspondente), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, 79-7 Tokiwadai, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",sasa67123@gmail.com,"Suyama, Yoshihisa/H-6115-2017","Suyama, Yoshihisa/0000-0002-3136-5489; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152","Mitsui & Co.

Here, we aim to understand the effects of leaf functional trait diversity on canopy light absorption. We focus on the diversity of three key functional traits that influence the light-canopy interaction: leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf optical properties (LOP). We used a 3D radiative transfer model to perform an in-silico biodiversity experiment to study the effects of leaf functional diversity on a light proxy for productivity (the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR)) and net radiation (shortwave albedo). We found that diverse canopies had lower albedo and higher FAPAR than the average of the corresponding monoculture values. In mixtures, FAPAR was unequally re-distributed between trees with distinct traits: some plant functional types absorbed more light and some plant functional types absorbed less than in monocultures. The net biodiversity effect on absorptance was greater when combining plant functional types with more distinct leaf traits. Our results support the mechanistic understanding of overyielding effects in functionally diverse canopies and may partially explain some of the growth-promoting mechanisms in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments.

In general, results from artificially assembled communities point to the important role of biodiversity showing that loss of species has a negative effect on various ecosystem functions (mostly assessed by above-ground peak biomass). However, the evidence from manipulations of natural communities is scarce, and results are often contradictory between these two approaches. In particular, the importance of species dominance for ecosystem functioning remains poorly understood. We created a gradient of plant species richness in a meadow community following a realistic species loss scenario (removal of less abundant species) to test the effect of diversity on community biomass and assess the importance of subordinate species compared with dominants in a 5-year experiment. Contrasting with results of BEF experiments with artificial assembly, we did not find any relationship between plant species diversity and above-ground biomass across the timeframe of the experiment. We provide evidence that dominant species' identity and traits are the main drivers of community biomass because dominant species were able to maintain biomass production after substantial species loss. Furthermore, dominants prevented community biomass from declining and biomass was indirectly influenced not by species richness but through differences in functional diversity. Our results support the mass ratio hypothesis, showing much bigger effect of dominant species on community biomass production and hints to the rather minor importance of the complementarity effect between species. We emphasize that BEF research should more focus on the role of dominant species in maintaining various ecosystem functions. Synthesis. Species diversity is a poor predictor of community above-ground biomass production and dominant species can effectively compensate the total production after substantial loss of other species in a grassland community.","[Lisner, Ales; Konecna, Marie; Blazek, Petr; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr Czech Acad Sci, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Lisner, A (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",aleslisner@seznam.cz,"Blažek, Petr/AAW-8682-2020; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Blažek, Petr/0000-0002-0901-4578; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Lisner, Ales/0000-0003-4881-7362",Czech Science Foundation;  [20-02901S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); ,"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This study was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR Project number: 20-02901S).

Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil? Location: West andmid-Norway. Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect. Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower. Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.","[Taugourdeau, Simon] CIRAD, Ave Agropolis, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Wehn, Solvi; Taugourdeau, Simon; Johansen, Line; Hovstad, Knut Anders] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Vinnavegen 38, N-7512 Stjordal, Norway",CIRAD; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research,"Wehn, S (autor correspondente), Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res NIBIO, Vinnavegen 38, N-7512 Stjordal, Norway.",Solvi.wehn@nibio.no; simon.taugourdeau@cirad.fr; Line.johansen@nibio.no; Knut.hovstad@nibio.no,"Simon, Taugourdeau/ABF-9503-2021","Simon, Taugourdeau/0000-0001-6561-3228; Hovstad, Knut Anders/0000-0002-7108-0787",Norwegian Research Council [208036/010],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This study was part of project no. 208036/010 funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

Also, in hyper-diverse systems, errors occur because identification is difficult, and species level values ignore intra-specific variation. To allow extensive trait mapping at the individual level, we evaluated the potential of Fourrier-Transformed Near Infra-Red Spectrometry (FT-NIR) to adequately describe 14 traits that are key for plant carbon, water, and nutrient balance. FT-NIR absorption spectra (1,000-2,500 nm) were obtained from dry leaves and branches of 1,324 trees of 432 species from a hyper-diverse Amazonian forest. FT-NIR spectra were related to measured traits for the same plants using partial least squares regressions. A further 80 plants were collected from a different site to evaluate model applicability across sites. Relative prediction error (RMSErel) was calculated as the percentage of the trait value range represented by the final model RMSE. The key traits used in most functional trait studies; specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, wood density and wood dry matter content can be well predicted by the model (R-2=0.69-0.78, RMSErel=9-11%), while leaf density, xylem proportion, bark density and bark dry matter content can be moderately well predicted (R-2=0.53-0.61, RMSErel=14-17%). Community-weighted means of all traits were well estimated with NIR, as did the shape of the frequency distribution of the community values for the above key traits. The model developed at the core site provided good estimations of the key traits of a different site. An evaluation of the sampling effort indicated that 400 or less individuals may be sufficient for establishing a good local model. We conclude that FT-NIR is an easy, fast and cheap method for the large-scale estimation of individual plant traits that was previously impossible. The ability to use dry intact leaves and branches unlocks the potential for using herbarium material to estimate functional traits; thus advancing our knowledge of community and ecosystem functioning from local to global scales.","[Costa, Flavia R.

Woody species were largely excluded from these early experiments, despite the ecological and socioeconomic importance of forest ecosystems. We discuss conceptual aspects of mechanistically driven research on the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship in forests, including the comparison of scientific approaches like 'observational studies', 'removal experiments', and 'synthetic-assemblage experiments'. We give a short overview on the differences between herbaceous and forest ecosystems, focusing on canopy characteristics, and the possibilities for individual versus population-based investigations. We present detailed information about the first large-scale, multisite and long-term biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment with tree species of temperate forests (BIOTREE - BIOdiversity and ecosystem processes in experimental TREE stands). At three sites of differing geology and local climate, we planted 200,000 saplings on a total area of 70 ha. At two sites, diversity gradients were established by varying the number of tree species (BIOTREE-SPECIES). At a third site, only functional diversity at a constant level of tree species richness was manipulated by selecting mixtures that differ in the functional trait values of the corresponding species (BIOTREE-FD). Additional experimental treatments at the subplot level include silvicultural management options, the addition of subdominant species, and the reduction of genetic diversity. Response variables focus on productivity, biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration, and resource use complementarity. We explore the use of different measures of functional diversity for a posteriori classifications of functional richness and their use in the analysis of our tree diversity experiment. The experiment is thought to provide a long-term research platform for a variety of scientific questions related to forest biodiversity and ecosystem processes. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

However, it still remains unknown whether the relationship between plant biodiversity and community productivity varies across different anthropogenic influences, and especially how changes in multiple biodiversity facets drive these impacts on productivity. Here, we measured different facets of biodiversity including functional and phylogenetic richness and evenness in mountain grasslands along an environmental gradient of elevation in Yulong Mountain, Yunnan, China. We combined biodiversity metrics in a series of linear mixed-effect models to determine the most parsimonious predictors for productivity, which was estimated by aboveground biomass in community. We examined how biodiversity-productivity relationships were affected by experimental warming, nitrogen addition, and livestock-grazing. Species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and single functional traits (leaf nitrogen content, mg/g) represented the most parsimonious combination in these scenarios, supporting a consensus that single-biodiversity metrics alone cannot fully explain ecosystem function. The biodiversity-productivity relationships were positive and strong, but the effects of treatment on biodiversity-productivity relationship were negligible. Our findings indicate that the strong biodiversity-productivity relationships are consistent in various anthropogenic drivers of environmental change.","[Liu, Jiajia; Ge, Xue-jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Detuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Yunnan Key Lab Integrat Conservat Plant Species E, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Lijiang Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Lian-ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Burgess, Kevin S.] Columbus State Univ, Univ Syst Georgia, Dept Biol, Columbus, GA USA; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cadotte, Marc W.] Univ Toronto, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto","Ge, XJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xjge@scbg.ac.cn,"Cadotte, Marc/AAG-8147-2020; Gao, Lianming/H-4527-2011; Ge, Xue-Jun/AAP-5967-2020; Gao, Lian-Ming/AAU-2613-2021","Cadotte, Marc/0000-0002-5816-7693; Gao, Lianming/0000-0001-9047-2658; Ge, Xue-Jun/0000-0002-5008-9475; Gao, Lian-Ming/0000-0001-9047-2658; Burgess, Kevin S./0000-0002-9663-9428; liu, detuan/0000-0002-2295-3799","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500335, 31570210]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2014CB954100]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31500335, 31570210; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, Grant/Award Number: 2014CB954100",NA,65,13,13,25,117,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Spanish forests are of particular interest because of the broad variation in environmental conditions and management history. We tested for the existence of a relationship between diversity effects and both carbon storage and tree productivity, and examined the relative importance of complementarity and selection mechanisms in a wide variety of forests, from cold deciduous Atlantic to xeric Mediterranean evergreen forests. LocationContinental Spain. MethodsWe used c. 54,000 plots of the Spanish Forest Inventory and maximum likelihood techniques to quantify how climate, stand structure and diversity shape carbon storage and tree productivity. Diversity effects included both complementarity and selection mechanisms, measured respectively through functional diversity and functional identity measures. ResultsDiversity had a significant effect on both carbon storage and tree productivity, even when controlling for confounding factors of climate and stand structure. A consistent positive effect of functional diversity on carbon storage and tree productivity was observed in all seven forest types studied. This relationship was not linear, and the largest changes in carbon storage and tree productivity were observed at low levels of functional diversity. However, the importance of complementarity effects was not consistent with the productivity of different forest types. Selection effects were particularly important in deciduous and Mediterranean pine forests, but had very little effect on mountain pines. Main conclusionsWe found a generally positive effect of diversity on carbon storage and tree productivity, supported by both complementarity and selection mechanisms. Thus, both functionally diverse forests and functionally important species should be maintained to adequately preserve and promote key ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and tree productivity.","[Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] CIFOR INIA, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena] CSIC, IRNAS, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad de Alcala; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS); Max Planck Society,"Ruiz-Benito, P (autor correspondente), Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Sci Bldg,Campus Univ, Madrid 28871, Spain.",palomaruizbenito@gmail.com,"Gómez-Aparicio, Lorena/K-6905-2014; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012; Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016","Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469","FUNDIV [ENV.2010.2.1.4-1]; FPU fellowship [AP2008-01325]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its programme QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System); French Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe' France;  [INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03];  [SUM2008-00004-C03-01]","FUNDIV; FPU fellowship(Spanish Government); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through its programme QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); French Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe' France; ; ","This research was initially supported by INTERBOS3-CGL2008-04503-C03-03 and SUM2008-00004-C03-01 projects, and by FUNDIV (ENV.2010.2.1.4-1) at a later stage.

However, whether historical dynamics in species distributions and richness translate to functional diversity patterns remains, for the most part, unknown. The geographic patterns of plant functional space size (richness) and packing (dispersion) for six widely distributed orders of European angiosperms were estimated using atlas distribution data and trait information. Then the relative importance of late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change and contemporary environmental factors (climate, productivity, and topography) as determinants of functional diversity of evaluated orders was assesed. Functional diversity patterns of all evaluated orders exhibited prominent glacial-interglacial climate change imprints, complementing the influence of contemporary environmental conditions. The importance of Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change factors was comparable to that of contemporary environmental factors across evaluated orders. Therefore, high long-term paleoclimate variability has imposed consistent supplementary constraints on functional diversity of multiple plant groups, a legacy that may permeate to ecosystem functioning and resilience. These findings suggest that strong near-future anthropogenic climate change may elicit long-term functional disequilibria in plant functional diversity.","[Ordonez, Alejandro; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Ordonez, A (autor correspondente), Aarhus Univ, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",alejandro.ordonez@bios.au.dk,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551",ERC [310886],ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"This article is a contribution to the HISTFUNC project (ERC Starting Grant 310886 to J.-C.S).

Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.","[Spasojevic, Marko J.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Spasojevic, Marko J.] Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Bahlai, Christie A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48915 USA; [Bahlai, Christie A.] Michigan State Univ, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, E Lansing, MI 48915 USA; [Bradley, Bethany A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Butterfield, Bradley J.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Tuanmu, Mao-Ning] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Sistla, Seeta] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Wiederholt, Ruscena] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Suding, Katharine N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL); Michigan State University; Michigan State University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; Yale University; University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Arizona; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Spasojevic, MJ (autor correspondente), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Spasojevic, MJ (autor correspondente), Washington Univ, Tyson Res Ctr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",mspaso@gmail.com,"Bahlai, Christie/L-5500-2019; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017; Bradley, Bethany/B-1964-2008; Tuanmu, Mao-Ning/ABI-5979-2020; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/AAO-4307-2020","Bahlai, Christie/0000-0002-8937-8709; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176; Bradley, Bethany/0000-0003-4912-4971; Tuanmu, Mao-Ning/0000-0002-8233-2935; SPASOJEVIC, MARKO/0000-0003-1808-0048",,,,NA,90,32,32,5,153,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Long-term productivity stability in plant communities is often associated with greater species, phylogenetic or functional diversity, more complex size and age structures, or higher asynchrony in species fluctuations (compensatory dynamics), all potentially increasing community resistance to perturbations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways is still poorly understood, especially in old-growth species-rich forests. Here we explore how compensatory dynamics and multiple facets of diversity underpin temporal stability of wood biomass production over forty years in a Japanese temperate forest, based on more than 45 500 stem increments from 15 species. Whereas the effect of species richness and phylogenetic diversity was small, the old-growth structural attributes markedly increased community stability via increased asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Greater standing tree volume, stem density and interspecific variation in growth rates enhanced productivity stability both directly and indirectly via increased asynchrony. This corroborates the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Asymmetric competition in old-growth patches, between dominant oaks and sub-canopy shade-tolerant firs and maples, is a major driver of productivity stability over time via compensatory dynamics. Overall productivity remains relatively constant in old-growth patches, as abundant firs and maples in the lower canopy layers compensate for biomass losses in canopy oaks caused by aging, wind and snow disturbances. Younger forest patches, composed of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species, had a lower stability of productivity, with reduced stem basal area and tree density due to higher understory bamboo coverage preventing tree regeneration and growth. We provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the stability of ecosystem functioning in diverse forest ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of preserving and supporting old-growth forests and their structural complexity.","[Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Uemura, Shigeru] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Forest Res Stn, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan; [Takahashi, Koichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Hara, Toshihiko] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Hokkaido University; Shinshu University; Hokkaido University,"Dolezal, J (autor correspondente), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.;Dolezal, J (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",jiriddolezal@gmail.com,"Fibich, Pavel/B-3013-2015; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Altman, Jan/B-4305-2015","Fibich, Pavel/0000-0001-9066-3753; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation [17-19376S, 17-07378S, 20-05840Y]; Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences); Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","The study was funded by the Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University and by Czech Science Foundation (grants 17-19376S, 17-07378S and 20-05840Y), Czech Academy of Sciences (RVO 67985939) and Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship.",NA,65,16,16,20,124,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2020,129,11,,,,NA,1692,1703,,10.1111/oik.07379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.07379,NA,AUG 2020,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OM5SL,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000555270000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,Jean,sim,,sim,sim,não,forest,temperate,positive;ns-for-leaf-traits,age;height;relative-growth-rate;SLA;LDMC;LNC;LPC,,NA,positive,positive,NA,positive,,,NA,NA,positive,NA,NA,NA,NA,positive,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,podemos ter mais de uma resposta dependendo da metrica de diversidade funcional analisada

Functional diversity is deemed a better indicator than species diversity to clarify the BEF relationships. However, most tests of the BEF relationship have been conducted in highly controlled plant communities, with terrestrial animal communities largely unexplored. Additionally, most BEF studies examined the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functions, with the effects of ecosystem functioning strength on biodiversity hardly considered. Based on a 6-yr grassland experiment in the typical steppe region of Inner Mongolia, we examined the variation of taxonomic diversity (TD) and functional diversity (FD) of both plant and arthropod communities, and their relations with grassland productivity, across three land management types (moderate grazing, mowing, and enclosure). We aimed to clarify the interrelations among plant FD, arthropod FD, grassland productivity, and soil factors. We found the following: (1) Grassland under mowing performed best in terms of sustaining a high TD and FD of plants and arthropods compared to that under grazing and enclosure. (2) The relationships between plant and arthropod diversity and productivity varied with management types. Plant TD and FD were negatively related, whereas arthropod FD was positively related with productivity under enclosure; plant FD, but not arthropod FD, was positively related with productivity under grazing; arthropod FD, but not plant FD, was negatively related with productivity under mowing. (3) Grassland productivity was positively interrelated with plant FD, but not plant TD; and was negatively interrelated with arthropod TD, but not arthropod FD across different management types. The respective positive vs. negative bidirectional relationships of productivity with plant diversity vs. arthropod diversity, were majorly a consequence of divergent grazing/mowing effects on plant vs. arthropod diversity. The results indicate that grazing increases plant diversity, but decreases arthropod diversity, whereas fall mowing provides a management strategy for conservation of both trophic levels. These results also provide new insights into the effects of land-use changes on biodiversity and ecosystem processes, and indicate the importance of incorporating the functional interrelations among different trophic groups in sustainable grassland management.","[Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Tang, Kuanyan; Wang, Yanan; Suri, Guga; Bai, Zheng; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Tang, Kuanyan; Wang, Yanan; Suri, Guga; Bai, Zheng; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University; Inner Mongolia University,"Li, FY (autor correspondente), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.",lifyhong@126.com,"wang, ya/HQZ-7558-2023; Li, Frank Yonghong/AAN-3093-2020","Li, Frank Yonghong/0000-0002-5137-8017",,,,NA,75,16,16,28,142,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We tested the hypotheses that (i) Caatinga vegetation near roads is less taxonomically, functionally and phylogenetically diverse, (ii) phylogenetically and functionally more clustered than vegetation further from roads, (iii) plant traits associated with herbivory deterrence are conserved within the phylogenetic lineages, and (iv) Caatinga vegetation near roads selects for disturbance-related traits. We sampled herbaceous and woody component of vegetation in four plots near roads and four plots further from roads to test these hypotheses. Sampled species were classified according to their resprouting capacity, nitrogen fixation, succulence/spines, urticancy/toxicity, lifeform, endozoochory, maximum height and maximum diameter, before we calculated the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities. Species richness, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities were lower in plots close to the roads, confirming roads as sources of disturbances. The phylogenetic structure of the Caatinga vegetation near roads was clustered, indicating environmental filtering by herbivory as the main pervasive disturbance in Caatinga ecosystems, since traits related to herbivory deterrence were conserved within phylogenetic lineages and were filtered in near roads. Thus, roads should be considered conduits of degradation causing taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional impoverishment of Caatinga vegetation.","[Mota, Nayara Mesquita; Gastauer, Markus; Carrion, Juan Fernando; Alves Meira-Neto, Joao Augusto] Univ Fed Vicosa, Lab Ecol & Evolut Plants, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Mota, Nayara Mesquita] Inhotim Bot Garden, Rua B,20 Fazenda Inhotim, BR-35460000 Brumadinho, MG, Brazil; [Gastauer, Markus] Inst Tecnol Vale, Rua Boaventura Silva 955, BR-66055090 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Carrion, Juan Fernando] Univ Estadual Feira de Santana, Ave Transnordestina S-N, BR-44036900 Feira De Santana, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Instituto Tecnologico Vale Desenvolvimento Sustentavel; Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana,"Meira-Neto, JAA (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Vicosa, Lab Ecol & Evolut Plants, BR-36570900 Vicosa, MG, Brazil.",j.meira@ufv.br,"Gastauer, Markus/GMW-6022-2022; Meira-Neto, Joao/H-8197-2012","Meira-Neto, Joao/0000-0001-5953-3942","DNIT (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes) [50600.056799/201321]; FUNARBE [6991]; BR235/UFV Team [1071/2013-DPP]; CNPq [301913/2012-9]; CAPES (PROAP); FAPEMIG [APQ-01309-16]; Biodiversitas Foundation [307591/2016-6, 306335/2020-4]",DNIT (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes); FUNARBE; BR235/UFV Team; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES (PROAP)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Biodiversitas Foundation,"The authors thank the DNIT (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes, process 50600.056799/201321), FUNARBE (process 6991), and BR235/UFV Team (process 1071/2013-DPP) for grants and financial support.

The lack of consensus about the functional responses of tree communities to land-use change is a major uncertainty in the assessments of human impacts on terrestrial ecosystem functions. In this study, we applied a machine-learning method to a large data set consisting of 2574 tree communities across Japan to examine changes in the functional composition of tree communities after land-use change while considering contexts including successional trajectories, forest types and the presence of gymnosperms. Specifically, we hypothesized that functional changes along successional gradients after land-use change can be different in different contexts. Effects of two successional variables (stand age and basal area) on functional composition were highly significant throughout the study region. Changes in functional composition with changes in the two successional variables differed greatly, and the effects of basal area often outweighed those of stand age. Tree communities with small basal area were generally characterized by functional traits related to the resource-acquisitive strategy, that is short adult stature, low leaf mass per unit area, small seeds, low wood density and large leaves, especially when gymnosperms were excluded from the analysis. Decreasing basal area but not decreasing stand age often led to a considerable loss in functional diversity. Despite these general trends, functional changes along successional gradients after land-use change were not necessarily parallel and the opposite patterns were sometimes observed among forest types, traits and taxonomic groups.Synthesis. As a whole, our analyses demonstrate that the functional changes in tree communities after land-use change are highly evident in a given context but can be different under different contexts. These changes in functional composition can trigger variable changes in ecosystem functions such as carbon and nutrient cycling that depend on the context.","[Aiba, Masahiro; Kurokawa, Hiroko; Oguro, Michio; Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Onoda, Yusuke] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Kurokawa, Hiroko; Masaki, Takashi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan",Tohoku University; Kyoto University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan,"Aiba, M (autor correspondente), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",mshiro5@gmail.com,"Onoda, Yusuke/L-7179-2015; Nakashizuka, Tohru/AAO-1081-2020; Aiba, Masahiro/A-1736-2009","Onoda, Yusuke/0000-0001-6245-2342; ","Japanese Ministry of Environment [S-9-3, S-9-1];  [2337007];  [23770026]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26711025] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Environment(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the managers of the forest plots in the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project (Ministry of the Environment, Japan) for their kind permission to collect samples and for related assistance, and Dr. Jun Nishihiro from Toho University for collecting part of the seed mass data.

Here, with rainout shelter facility, a field experiment with a large variation in precipitation and N addition was conducted to disentangle the responses of the plant community to normal precipitation, less precipitation, and rewetting conditions in a desert steppe, Inner Mongolia, northern China. The field experiment established a unique annual precipitation change cycle across normal precipitation, less precipitation, and rewetting processes to quantify drought resistance, recovery and resilience by calculating functional differences among three years. Furthermore, the relationships between plant community functional traits and response indices (i.e., the resistance, recovery, and resilience) were tested to clarify the mechanisms driving their responses to precipitation regimes and N addition. The aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased with annual precipitation and was enhanced by N addition. ANPP with reduced precipitation regimes was less resistant to drought but recovered significantly greater than that with increased precipitation regimes. The perennial species, C3 plants, and forbs mainly contributed to the variations in vegetation productivity in response to drought and wet status cycles. Drought resistance and the recovery of species' functional diversity, evenness, and ANPP stability were closely associated with precipitation changes. The present findings suggested that altered precipitation patterns, community composition, and functional stability contribute to ecosystem stability during water change cycles and are mediated slightly by N deposition. These findings advance understanding of the mechanisms of ecosystem functioning underlying the responses to climatic change.","[Yu, Hongying; Ma, Quanhui; Liu, Xiaodi; Li, Yibo; Li, Lang; Qi, Miao; Wu, Wenjuan; Wang, Yuhui; Xu, Zhenzhu; Zhou, Guangsheng; Zhang, Feng] Inst Bot Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hongying; Ma, Quanhui; Liu, Xiaodi; Li, Yibo; Li, Lang; Qi, Miao; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhou, Guangsheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hongying; Zhou, Guangsheng] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS); Chinese Academy of Sciences","Xu, ZZ; Zhou, GS; Zhang, F (autor correspondente), Inst Bot Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",xuzz@ibcas.ac.cn; zhougs@cma.gov.cn; zhangfeng@ibcas.ac.cn,"Wu, wenjuan/GPX-6968-2022; ?, ??/GXZ-7548-2022; Xu, Zhenzhu/L-1362-2015","Xu, Zhenzhu/0000-0001-5246-8981",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41975145]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0106]; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest [GYHY201506001-3]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA26020103],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41975145), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK0106), the China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects) (GYHY201506001-3), and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA26020103).

Although the understory accounts for the majority of plant diversity in forests, it remains unclear how understory aboveground biomass production (UABP) is influenced by its species diversity and community-level functional traits. Location Great Xing'an Mountains of ortheastern China. Methods We quantified the effects of species richness, community aggregated traits (community weighted mean trait values, CWM) and functional diversity (functional dispersion, FDis) on UABP using structural equation modeling (SEM), which simultaneously accounted for the effects of overstory tree basal area, stand age, and soil fertility. Results In the full model, species richness had a negative direct, a positive indirect and no total effect on UABP. Furthermore, CWM and FDis, respectively, exhibited positive and no effect on UABP. Among the covariates, soil fertility, stand age, and overstory tree basal area had, respectively, positive, negative, and no effect on UABP. In the model without species richness, all trait variables had similar effects on UABP to those in the full model. In the richness-only model without traits, species richness, soil fertility and stand age had no effect on UABP. Conclusions Our results suggest that the selection effect largely determined understory DPRs due to the stronger effects of CWM on UABP than of FDis. Soil fertility exhibited the strongest influence on understory DPRs due to its parallel influences on traits, diversity, and productivity. The increase in resource availability induced by overstory tree litter-fall likely promoted soil fertility as the main driver of the understory DPRs. Stand age exhibited a negative effect on UABP, which may have contributed to the increases in shrub dominance and decreases in production due to limited resources.","[Liu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo; Chen, Han Y.

Focussing on plant functional traits and their diversity, we analysed a crop-weed interaction study with different levels of weed species and barley cultivar diversity to assess how weed species and barley cultivars respond to competition. Pre-emption of light resources by the taller barley did not impact on the weeds, with both weeds and barley showing similar order of magnitude shifts in height, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content in response to crop-weed competition. These shifts were to a more conservative growth pattern, and suggest in this study a greater importance of below- than above-ground interactions in driving trait responses. The mixture of barley cultivars shifted the weeds to a more conservative growth pattern compared to the cultivar monocultures. The results indicate that cultivar mixtures could result in less need for weed control in arable fields, and possibly that the development of complementary cultivar mixtures could reinforce this effect. This confirms the results of other studies which show that mixtures either improve yields or make yields less variable in response to weed competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As competition tends to be stronger between species with more similar niches, we hypothesize that species phylogenetic relatedness, under niche conservatism, may be a reasonable surrogate of niche similarity between species, and thus influence the strength of priority effects. We tested this hypothesis using a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we established bacterial species pools with different levels of phylogenetic relatedness and manipulated the immigration history of species from each pool into microcosms. Our results showed that strong priority effects, and hence multiple community states, only emerged for the species pool with the greatest phylogenetic relatedness. Community assembly also resulted in a significant positive relationship between bacterial phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem functions. Interestingly, these results emerged despite a lack of phylogenetic conservatism for most of the bacterial functional traits considered. Our results highlight the utility of phylogenetic information for understanding the structure and functioning of ecological communities, even when phylogenetically conserved functional traits are not identified or measured.","[Tan, Jiaqi; Pu, Zhichao; Ryberg, Wade A.; Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ryberg, Wade A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Tan, JQ (autor correspondente), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jtan@gatech.edu,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019","Ryberg, Wade/0000-0003-2548-8113",British Ecological Society; U.S. NSF [DEB-1120281]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1120281] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,British Ecological Society; U.S. NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank Michael Cortez, Cyrille Violle, Edward Burdette, and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments, which improved the manuscript.

However, how the duration of plant growth of functionally distinct grassland plant communities influences abiotic and biotic soil properties and thus ecosystem functions is poorly known. In a field experiment, we established identical experimental subplots in two successive years comprising of fast- or slow-growing grass and forb community mixtures with different forb:grass ratios. After one and two years of plant growth, we measured above- and belowground biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, organic matter, soil nutrients), soil microbial properties (respiration, biomass, community composition), and nematode abundance. Fast- and slow-growing plant communities did not differ in above- and belowground biomass. However, fast- and slow-growing plant communities created distinct soil bacterial communities, whereas soil fungal communities differed most in 100% forb communities compared to other forb:grass ratio mixtures. Moreover, soil nitrate availability was higher after two years of plant growth, whereas the opposite was true for soil ammonium concentrations. Furthermore, total nematodes and especially bacterial-feeding nematodes were more abundant after two years of plant growth. Our results show that plant community composition is a driving factor in soil microbial community assembly and that the duration of plant growth plays a crucial role in the establishment of plant community and functional group composition effects on abiotic and biotic soil ecosystem functioning under natural field conditions.","[Steinauer, Katja; Heinen, Robin; Hannula, S.

However, it remains unclear that whether the ecological consequences of genotypic diversity of the dominant species is similar to that of species diversity. In this study, diversity effects on biomass of 12 companion species and 12 genotypes of the dominant species (Stipa grandis) in the Inner Mongolia Steppe of China were examined by two independent diversity experiments. In order to explain the diversity effects, seven plant functional traits for each species or each genotype of S. grandis per mixture treatment were measured and their Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) was estimated. There was significantly positive net species diversity effect on aboveground biomass, which was mainly contributed by complementarity effect; however, net diversity effects were not significant in genotypic diversity experiment. The FDQ among S. grandis genotypes was significantly lower than that among the companion species, and the relatively lower FDQ would increase niche overlap and limit complementarity effect among genotypes. Neither species diversity nor genotypic diversity of S. grandis showed significant influences on belowground biomass, suggesting the non-consistent results of diversity effect between belowground and aboveground systems. The present finding highlighted the species diversity effects on biomass, the role of FDQ on explaining complementarity effect by niche overlap or resource use efficient.","[Yang, Xue; Wang, Xiao Ping; Qu, Yao Bing; Wu, Man; Zhao, Nian Xi; Gao, Yu Bao] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jin Long; Wang, Zhu Lin; Wang, Si Qi] Tianjin Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Resources & Environm, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tianjin Agricultural University,"Zhao, NX (autor correspondente), Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",wangjinlong@mail.nankai.edu.cn; zhaonianxi@nankai.edu.cn; ybgao@mail.nankai.edu.cn,"Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500706]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31570427, 31770505]; Young and Middle-aged Backbone Innovative Talent Training Plan in Tianjin [201606205032]; China Scholarship Council [201606205032]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young and Middle-aged Backbone Innovative Talent Training Plan in Tianjin; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0500706); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570427and 31770505); and the Young and Middle-aged Backbone Innovative Talent Training Plan in Tianjin and the China Scholarship Council (201606205032).,NA,50,9,9,13,76,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,1872-6992,,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

However, there is growing recognition that leaf wetting can have positive effects. We measured variation in two traits, leaf drip tips and leaf water repellency, in a series of nine tropical forest communities occurring along a 3300-m elevation gradient in southern Peru. To extend this climatic gradient, we also assembled published leaf water repellency values from 17 additional sites. We then tested hypotheses for how these traits should vary as a function of climate. Contrary to expectations, we found that the proportion of species with drip tips did not increase with increasing precipitation. Instead, drip tips increased with increasing temperature. Moreover, leaf water repellency was very low in our sites and the global analysis indicated high repellency only in sites with low precipitation and temperatures. Our findings suggest that drip tips and repellency may not solely reflect the negative effects of wetting on plant function. Understanding the drivers of leaf wettability traits can provide insight into the effects of leaf wetting on plant, community, and ecosystem function.","[Goldsmith, Gregory R.; Bentley, Lisa Patrick; Shenkin, Alexander; Salinas, Norma; Blonder, Benjamin; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Goldsmith, Gregory R.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, Ecosyst Fluxes Grp, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland; [Castro-Ccossco, Rosa; Chambi-Porroa, Percy] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Ave Cultura,Nro 733, Cuzco, Peru; [Martin, Roberta E.; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, 260 Panama St, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONICET, FCEFyN, CC 495, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Enquist, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Oxford; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco; Carnegie Institution for Science; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba; University of Arizona,"Goldsmith, GR (autor correspondente), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.;Goldsmith, GR (autor correspondente), Paul Scherrer Inst, Lab Atmospher Chem, Ecosyst Fluxes Grp, CH-5232 Villigen, Switzerland.",gregory.goldsmith@psi.ch,"Shenkin, Alexander/L-1653-2017; Salinas, Norma/K-8960-2015; Shenkin, Alexander/AAQ-4166-2021; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008; Díaz, Sandra/ABE-7349-2020; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015","Shenkin, Alexander/0000-0003-2358-9367; Salinas, Norma/0000-0001-9941-2109; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096; Díaz, Sandra/0000-0003-0012-4612; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Goldsmith, Gregory/0000-0003-3567-8949; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530","UK Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J023418/1]; European Research Council [321131, 291585]; John D. and Catherine T.

To control or predict how these communities function, we require a better understanding of the factors which influence microbial community productivity. Here, we combine functional resource use assays with a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment to determine whether the functional traits of constituent species can be used to predict community productivity. We quantified the abilities of 12 bacterial species to metabolise components of lignocellulose and then assembled these species into communities of varying diversity and composition to measure their productivity growing on lignocellulose, a complex natural substrate. A positive relationship between diversity and community productivity was caused by a selection effect whereby more diverse communities were more likely to contain two species that significantly improved community productivity. Analysis of functional traits revealed that the observed selection effect was primarily driven by the abilities of these species to degrade beta-glucan. Our results indicate that by identifying the key functional traits underlying microbial community productivity we could improve industrial bioprocessing of complex natural substrates.","[Evans, Rachael; Alessi, Anna M.; Bird, Susannah; McQueen-Mason, Simon J.; Bruce, Neil C.; Brockhurst, Michael A.] Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Brockhurst, Michael A.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"Evans, R (autor correspondente), Univ York, Dept Biol, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",re638@york.ac.uk,,"Bruce, Neil Charles/0000-0003-0398-2997; Alessi, Anna/0000-0001-9983-6091; Brockhurst, Michael/0000-0003-0362-820X","BBSRC White Rose DTP [BB/J014443/1]; BBSRC [BB/1018492/1]; BBSRC [BB/I018492/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I018492/1, 1502633] Funding Source: researchfish",BBSRC White Rose DTP(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),We thank Gavin Thomas and Colin Beale for helpful discussion and comment regarding experimental design and results analysis.

Forest ecosystems are critical for the global regulation of carbon (C), a substantial portion of which is stored in above-ground biomass (AGB). While it is well understood that taxonomic and functional composition, stand structure and environmental gradients influence spatial variation in AGB, the relative strengths of these drivers at landscape scales have not been investigated in temperate forests. Furthermore, when biodiversity enhances C storage, it is unclear whether it is through mass-ratio effects (i.e. the dominant trait in communities regulates AGB) or through niche complementarity (i.e. increased AGB due to interspecific resource partitioning). 2. To address these mechanisms, we analysed data from a census of 28,262 adult trees sampled across 900 ha of temperate deciduous forest in southwestern Pennsylvania. We used data on four key plant functional traits to determine if (1) there is a positive relationship between species diversity and AGB and (2) whether this is due to mass-ratio effects or niche complementarity. We also sought to (3) identify the physical stand structural attributes and topographic variables that -influence AGB across this landscape. 3. We found AGB was positively related to species richness and negatively related to species evenness, albeit weakly, while functional diversity indices had neutral effects. Above-ground biomass was enhanced in communities dominated by traits related to greater maximum tree height, deeper minimum rooting depths and larger seeds. Most importantly, areas with high AGB were dominated by Acer saccharum and Liriodendron tulipifera. Overall, these results support mass-ratio effects, with little evidence for niche complementarity. 4. Synthesis. Stand structure, topography, and species and functional composition, but not taxonomic or functional diversity, were found to be key drivers of above-ground biomass at landscape scales (<900 ha) in this temperate deciduous forest. Our findings suggest that simultaneously managing for both high diversity and for above-ground carbon storage may prove challenging in some forest systems. Our results further indicate that the impact of tree biodiversity loss on above-ground carbon stocks will depend greatly on the identity of the species that are lost.","[Fotis, Alexander T.; Murphy, Stephen J.; Ricart, Raleigh D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Krishnadas, Meghna; Queenborough, Simon A.; Comita, Liza S.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Whitacre, James; Wenzel, John W.] Carnegie Museum Nat Hist, Powdermill Nat Reserve, Rector, PA USA; [Whitacre, James] Univ Illinois, Univ Lib, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Comita, Liza S.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Ancon, Panama",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Yale University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Fotis, AT (autor correspondente), Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",fotis.2@osu.edu,,"Whitacre, James/0000-0003-3464-9337; Krishnadas, Meghna/0000-0003-2231-9787",Heinz Endowments,Heinz Endowments,The vegetation survey was made possible through a grant from the Heinz Endowments.

It is uncertain which environmental factors determine the economics spectrum and whether traits associated with reproduction co-vary with the economics spectrum. To determine these trait-environment relationships for agricultural ecosystems, this study was conducted at field, pasture, and heathland sites forming a strong land use gradient in Northwest Germany. The abundance of 49 species was recorded in 85 plots together with their traits (canopy height, specific leaf area, leaf N, leaf N:P, leaf and stem dry matter content, life cycle, reproductive investment (RI) in seed mass and seed number), as well as parameters describing soil resources and land use disturbances. RLQ multivariate analysis of the data set related an environmental table to a species trait table using a species abundance table to extract the joint structure between them. Thereafter, we clustered the species on the RLQ axis to extract functional groups. Traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum were strongly related to soil resources that co-varied with disturbance intensity. A division of the whole land use gradient into agricultural and heathland sites showed that RI was not decoupled from trait-environment relationships although the direction of the RI-environment relationship was opposite in the two subsets. Species were clumped rather than linearly arranged in the trait-environment space and the functional groups broadly corresponded to weed communities, pastures with differing intensities, and heathlands. The trade-off in plant economics responding to soil resources supports predictions of previous theoretical and empirical work. Different RI-environment relationships in agricultural sites and heathlands emphasize the relevance of local scales in trait-environment studies. In general, the results point to some of the biological mechanisms controlling functions and services of agricultural ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Annual precipitation varied by greater than a factor of three over 11 years in central Texas, USA leading to large variation in production. Stability was greatest in communities that were not dominated by few species and in which dominant species rooted shallowly, had dense leaves, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in production. Stability may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits as on species richness alone. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) varies in response to temporal fluctuations in weather. Temporal stability of community ANPP may be increased by increasing plant species richness, but stability often varies at a given richness level implying a dependence on abundances and functional properties of member species. We measured stability in ANPP during 11 years in field plots (Texas, USA) in which we varied the richness and relative abundances of perennial grassland species at planting. We sought to identify species abundance patterns and functional traits linked to the acquisition and processing of essential resources that could be used to improve richness-based predictions of community stability. We postulated that community stability would correlate with abundance-weighted indices of traits that influence plant responses to environmental variation. Annual precipitation varied by a factor of three leading to large inter-annual variation in ANPP. Regression functions with planted and realized richness (species with > 1% of community ANPP during the final four years) explained 32% and 25% of the variance in stability, respectively. Regression models that included richness plus the fraction of community ANPP produced by the two most abundant species in combination with abundance-weighted values of either the fraction of sampled root biomass at 20-45 cm depth, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or response to greater-than-average precipitation of plants grown in monocultures explained 58-69% (planted richness) and 58-64% (realized richness) of the variance in stability. Stability was greatest in communities that were not strongly dominated by only two species and in which plants rooted shallowly, had high values of LDMC, or responded to the wettest year with a minimal increase in ANPP. Our results indicate that the temporal stability of grassland ANPP may depend as much on species abundances and functional traits linked to plant responses to precipitation variability as on species richness alone.","[Polley, H.

There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed PFTs. JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme. We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based approaches and with fewer inputs. The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.","[Pavlick, R.; Drewry, D.

Increased precipitation and N addition stimulated and suppressed community species richness, respectively, across 6 years (2005-2010) of the manipulative experiment. N addition and increased precipitation significantly altered plant community structure and composition at functional groups levels. The significant relationship between species richness and soil moisture (SM) suggests that plant community structure is mediated by water under changing environmental conditions. In addition, plant height played an important role in affecting the responses of plant communities to N addition, and the effects of increased precipitation on plant community were dependent on species rooting depth.

Biodiversity conservation could therefore be a critical aspect of climate mitigation policies. There is, however, limited understanding of the role of individual species for this relationship, which could aid in focusing conservation efforts and forest management planning. This study characterizes the functional specialization and redundancy for 95% of all tree species (basal area weighted percentage) in a diverse tropical forest in the central Congo Basin and relates this to species' abundance, contribution to aboveground carbon, and maximum size. Functional characterization is based on a set of traits related to resource acquisition (wood density, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content, and leaf stable carbon isotope composition). We show that within both mixed and monodominant tropical forest ecosystems, the highest functional specialization and lowest functional redundancy are solely found in rare tree species and significantly more in rare species holding large-sized individuals. Rare species cover the entire range of low and high functional redundancy, contributing both unique and redundant functions. Loss of species supporting functional redundancy could be buffered by other species in the community, including more abundant species. This is not the case for species supporting high functional specialization and low functional redundancy, which would need specific conservation attention. In terms of tropical forest management planning, we argue that specific conservation of large-sized trees is imperative for long-term maintenance of ecosystem functioning.","[Kearsley, Elizabeth; Verbeeck, Hans; Bauters, Marijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Ghent, Belgium; [Hufkens, Koen] INRA, UMR ISPA, Villenave Dornon, France; [Bauters, Marijn; Boeckx, Pascal; Huygens, Dries] Univ Ghent, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Ghent, Belgium; [Beeckman, Hans] Royal Museum Cent Africa, Serv Wood Biol, Tervuren, Belgium; [Huygens, Dries] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Agr Engn & Soil Sci, Valdivia, Chile",Ghent University; INRAE; Ghent University; Royal Museum for Central Africa; Universidad Austral de Chile,"Kearsley, E (autor correspondente), Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Ghent, Belgium.",elizabeth.kearsley@ugent.be,,"Verbeeck, Hans/0000-0003-1490-0168; Kearsley, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0046-3606; Hufkens, Koen/0000-0002-5070-8109",Federaal Wetenschapsbeleid [SD/AR/01A],Federaal Wetenschapsbeleid,"Federaal Wetenschapsbeleid, Grant/Award Number: SD/AR/01A",NA,75,8,9,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

At regional scales, however, plant species richness is mostly increasing rather than decreasing because successful plant species introductions far outnumber extinctions. If these regional increases in richness lead to local increases in diversity, a reasonable prediction is that productivity, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling will increase following invasion, yet this prediction has rarely been tested empirically. We tested this prediction in novel forest communities dominated by introduced species (similar to 90% basal area) in lowland Hawaiian rain forests by comparing their functionality to that of native forests. We conducted our comparison along a natural gradient of increasing nitrogen availability, allowing for a more detailed examination of the role of plant functional trait differences (specifically, N-2 fixation) in driving possible changes to ecosystem function. Hawaii is emblematic of regional patterns of species change; it has much higher regional plant richness than it did historically, due to >1000 plant species introductions and only; 71 known plant extinctions, resulting in an similar to 100% increase in richness. At local scales, we found that novel forests had significantly higher tree species richness and higher diversity of dominant tree species. We further found that aboveground biomass, productivity, nutrient turnover (as measured by soil-available and litter-cycled nitrogen and phosphorus), and belowground carbon storage either did not differ significantly or were significantly greater in novel relative to native forests. We found that the addition of introduced N-2-fixing tree species on N-limited substrates had the strongest effect on ecosystem function, a pattern found by previous empirical tests. Our results support empirical predictions of the functional effects of diversity, but they also suggest basic ecosystem processes will continue even after dramatic losses of native species diversity if simple functional roles are provided by introduced species. Because large portions of the Earth's surface are undergoing similar transitions from native to novel ecosystems, our results are likely to be broadly applicable.","[Mascaro, Joseph; Schnitzer, Stefan A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hughes, R.

We developed a novel analytic approach to measure integrated ecosystem responses to resource-enhancing global changes, and how such whole ecosystem slow-to-fast transitions are linked to diversity and exotic invasions in real-world ecosystems. We asked how 5-yr experimental rainfall and nutrient enhancements in a natural grassland system affected 16 ecosystem functions, pools, and stoichiometry variables considered to indicate slow vs. fast cycling. We combined these metrics into a novel index we termed slow-fast multifunctionality and assessed its relationship to plant community diversity and exotic plant dominance. Nutrient and rainfall addition interacted to affect average slow-fast multifunctionality. Nutrient addition alone pushed the system toward faster cycling, but this effect weakened with the joint addition of rainfall and nutrients. Variables associated with soil nutrient pools and cycling most strongly contributed to this antagonistic interaction. Nutrient and water addition together, respectively, had additive or synergistic effects on plant trait composition and productivity, demonstrating divergence of above- and belowground ecosystem responses. Our novel metric of faster cycling was strongly associated with decreased plant species richness and increased exotic species dominance. These results demonstrate the breadth of interacting community and ecosystem changes that ensue when resource limitation is relaxed.","[Eskelinen, Anu; Harpole, W.

We conducted a 6-year rainfall manipulation experiment in a semiarid grassland that consisted of an initial 2-year drought (2015-2016), followed by a recovery period (2017-2018) and, finally, a second 2-year drought (2019-2020). In each year, we estimated aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species richness, community-weighted mean (CWM) plant traits, and several indices of functional diversity. The initial drought led to reduced ANPP, which was primarily driven by limited growth of forbs in the first year and grasses in the second year. Total ANPP completely recovered as the rapid recovery of grass productivity compensated for the slow recovery of forb productivity. The subsequent drought led to a greater reduction in total ANPP than the initial drought due to the greater decline of both grass and forb productivity. The structural equation models revealed that soil moisture influenced ANPP responses directly during the initial drought, and indirectly during the subsequent drought by lowering functional diversity, which resulted in reduced total ANPP. Additionally, ANPP was positively influenced by CWM plant height and leaf nitrogen during the recovery period and recurrent drought, respectively. Overall, the greater impact of the second drought on ecosystem function than the initial drought, as well as the underlying differential mechanism, underscores the need for an understanding of how increased drought frequency may alter semiarid grassland functioning.","[Luo, Wentao; Ma, Wang; Song, Lin; Wang, Zhengwen; Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Muraina, Taofeek O.] Oyo State Coll Agr & Technol, Dept Anim Hlth & Prod, Igbo Ora, Nigeria; [Griffin-Nolan, Robert J.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA USA; [Fu, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Grassland Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Knapp, Alan K.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Knapp, Alan K.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Han, Xingguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Han, Xingguo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Collins, Scott L.] Univ New Mex, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Santa Clara University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Beijing Forestry University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Luo, WT (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Peoples R China.",wentaoluo@iae.ac.cn,"Muraina, Taofeek O./ABC-8904-2021; Luo, Wentao/J-7634-2015","Muraina, Taofeek O./0000-0003-2646-2732; Luo, Wentao/0000-0002-9543-1123",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Foundation; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS;  [2022YFF1300603];  [31971465];  [32171549];  [DEB-1856383];  [2020199],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; ; ; ; ; ,"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by funding from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2022YFF1300603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31971465 and 32171549), the National Science Foundation (DEB-1856383), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2020199).",NA,27,2,2,68,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2023,104,2,,,,NA,,,e3920,10.1002/ecy.3920,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3920,NA,jan.-23,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,8C2WJ,36416074,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000906783000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, biodiversity management tends to focus on a single index, generally taxonomic diversity, assuming a strong positive correlation among biodiversity components across scales. This can result in a mismanagement of functional and phylogenetic diversities with negative consequences for ecosystem functioning and long-term maintenance of services. Understanding the relationships among biodiversity components, how they change across scales and which their main drivers are can lead to more sustainable management of biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services and functions. We used an integrative approach of biodiversity where we investigated alpha and beta taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) diversity of orthopteran communities as well as species and functional traits composition and their associated drivers at the local and landscape scales in permanent mesic grasslands of the French Jura Mountains. We assessed whether orthopteran TD, FD and PD were positively correlated. We also determined the drivers of TD, FD and PD and their changes across scales and among indices using data related to soil, agricultural practices, elevation, and biotic interactions with plants. Our results showed that (i) elevation was a strong driver of orthopteran community trait composition, (ii) orthopteran alpha TD, FD and PD were correlated among themselves and increased with plant species richness, and (iii) local beta diversity was not correlated with alpha diversity. Beta diversity had different drivers at local and landscape scale: it was influenced by soil chemistry and texture at the local scale and increased with the difference in elevation among plots at the landscape scale. This study evidences distinct processes driving alpha and beta diversity of orthopteran communities at both the local and landscape scales. It supports the hypothesis that less intensive agricultural practices enhance orthopteran diversity and highlights the importance to consider beta diversity at both local and landscape scale when designing and assessing the management regimes of grassland ecosystems. Prioritizing the importance of the different biodiversity components and spatial scales constitutes an important challenge for sustainable grassland management.","[Fournier, Bertrand; Mouly, Arnaud; Gillet, Francois] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Fournier, Bertrand] Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, 7141 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada; [Mouly, Arnaud] Jardin Bot Ville Besancon, Besancon, France; [Mouly, Arnaud] Univ Franche Comte, Besancon, France; [Moretti, Marco] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Gillet, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Ecol Syst Lab, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Franche-Comte; Concordia University - Canada; Universite de Franche-Comte; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","Fournier, B (autor correspondente), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR 6249, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France.",bfourni@gmail.com,"Fournier, Bertrand/O-8650-2016; Gillet, François/B-6160-2008","Fournier, Bertrand/0000-0002-7106-6109; Gillet, François/0000-0002-3334-1069; Moretti, Marco/0000-0002-5845-3198",Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site Jurassian Arc; Conseil Regional de Franche-Comte; Comite Interprofessionnel de Gestion du Comte (CIGC),Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site Jurassian Arc; Conseil Regional de Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); Comite Interprofessionnel de Gestion du Comte (CIGC),"We thank Leslie Mauchamp for data collection, the farmers who participated in this project, and Francois Dehondt and Frederic Mora (Conservatoire Botanique National de Franche-Comte - Observatoire Regional des Invertebres) for their help in orthopteran species identification.

Ecological studies identifying a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services motivate projections that higher plant diversity will increase services from agroecosystems. While this idea is compelling, evidence of generalizable relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services that could be broadly applied in agricultural systems is lacking. 2. Cover crops grown in rotation with cash crops are a realistic strategy to increase agroecosystem diversity. We evaluated the prediction that further increasing diversity with cover crop polycultures would enhance ecosystem services and multifunctionality in a 2-year study of eighteen cover crop treatments ranging in diversity from one to eight species. Five ecosystem services were measured in each cover crop system and regression analysis used to explore the relationship between multifunctionality and several diversity indices. 3. As expected, there was a positive relationship between species richness and multifunctionality, but it only explained a small fraction of variance in ecosystem services ( marginal R-2 = 0.05). In contrast, indices of functional diversity, particularly the distribution of trait abundances, were stronger predictors of multifunctionality (marginal R-2 = 0.15-0.38). 4. Synthesis and application. In a corn production system, simply increasing cover crop species richness will have a small impact on agroecosystem services, but designing polycultures that maximize functional diversity may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality.","[Finney, Denise M.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 East Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Kaye, Jason P.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 116 ASI, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Finney, DM (autor correspondente), Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 East Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",dfinney@ursinus.edu,"Finney, Denise/GYI-8917-2022",,"Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Graduate Research Programme [GNE11-017]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-51300-30638]; USDA-NIFA Predoctoral Fellowship Programme [2012-67011-19662]; ARCS Foundation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Chapter","Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Graduate Research Programme; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA-NIFA Predoctoral Fellowship Programme; ARCS Foundation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Chapter","We thank the Russell E.

The hypothesis that complementarity and selection effects drive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions is well accepted, and an approach to statistically untangle the relative importance of these effects has been widely applied. In contrast, empirical demonstrations of the biological mechanisms that underlie these relationships remain rare. Here, on the basis of a field experiment with young trees, we provide evidence that one form of complementarity in plant communities-complementarity among crowns in canopy space-is a mechanism, related to light interception and use, that links biodiversity with ecosystem productivity. Stem biomass overyielding increased sharply in mixtures with greater crown complementarity. Inherent differences among species in crown architecture led to greater crown complementarity in functionally diverse species mixtures. Intraspecific variation, specifically neighbourhood-driven plasticity in crowns, further modified spatial complementarity and strengthened the positive relationship with overyielding-crown plasticity and inherent interspecific differences contributed near equally in explaining patterns of overyielding. We posit that crown complementarity is an important mechanism that may contribute to diversity-enhanced productivity in forests.","[Williams, Laura J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec, Ctr Forest Res, Ctr Ville Stn, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2753, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University,"Williams, LJ (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",will3972@umn.edu,"Williams, Laura/AAI-9757-2021; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Williams, Laura/0000-0003-3555-4778; Paquette, Alain/0000-0003-1048-9674; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630","University of Minnesota (College of Biological Sciences); University of Minnesota (College of food and Natural Resources); University of Minnesota (Institute on the Environment, and Graduate School); National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; International Fulbright Science and Technology Award","University of Minnesota (College of Biological Sciences)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); University of Minnesota (College of food and Natural Resources); University of Minnesota (Institute on the Environment, and Graduate School); National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); International Fulbright Science and Technology Award","C Tobner, S.

Mechanistic explanations for this relationship suggest that the role organisms play in the ecosystem (i.e., niches or functional traits) is a better predictor of ecosystem stability and productivity than taxonomic richness. Here, we tested the capacity of functional diversity in nitrogen uptake in experimental microalgal communities to predict the complementarity effect (CE) and selection effect (SE) of biodiversity on productivity. We grew five algal species as monocultures and as polycultures in pairwise combinations in homogeneous (ammonium, nitrate, or urea alone) and heterogeneous nitrogen (mixed nitrogen) environments to determine whether complementarity between species may be enhanced in heterogeneous environments. We show that the positive diversity effects on productivity in heterogeneous environments resulted from complementarity effects with no positive contribution by species-specific SEs. Positive biodiversity effects in homogeneous environments, when present (nitrate and urea treatments but not ammonium), were driven both by CE and SE. Our results suggest that functional diversity increases species complementarity and productivity mainly in heterogeneous resource environments. These results provide evidence that the positive effect of functional diversity on community productivity depends on the diversity of resources present in the environment.","[Mandal, Shovon; Efroymson, Rebecca A.; Mathews, Teresa J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Shurin, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Mathews, TJ (autor correspondente), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",mathewstj@ornl.gov,,"Mathews, Teresa/0000-0001-6780-1142; MANDAL, SHOVON/0000-0002-8511-7763; Shurin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7870-1972","U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: Biotechnologies Office; United States Government","U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: Biotechnologies Office(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); United States Government","This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

However, the degree to which the relationship between species-, structural-, and trait-diversity of forests and multifunctionality depend on the context (such as stand age or abiotic conditions) is not well studied. Here, we hypothesized that context-dependency of tree species diversity, functional trait composition and stand structural attributes promote temperate forest multifunctionality including above- and below-ground multiple and single functions. To do so, we used repeated forest inventory data, from temperate mixed forests of northeast China, to quantify two above-ground (i.e. coarse woody productivity and wild edible plant biomass), five below-ground (i.e. soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and sulfur) functions, tree species diversity, individual tree size variation (CVDBH) and functional trait composition of specific leaf area (CWMSLA) as well as stand age and abiotic conditions. We found that tree species diversity increased forest multifunctionality and most of the single functions. Below-ground single and multifunctionality were better explained by tree species diversity. In contrast, above-ground single and multifunctionality were better explained by CVDBH. However, CWMSLA was also an additional important driver for maintaining above- and below-ground forest multifunctionality through opposing plant functional strategies. Stand age markedly reduced forest multifunctionality, tree species diversity and CWMSLA but substantially increased CVDBH. Below-ground forest multifunctionality and tree species diversity decreased while above-ground forest multifunctionality increased on steep slopes. These results highlight that context-dependency of forest diversity attributes might regulate forest multifunctionality but may not have a consistent effect on above-ground and below-ground forest multifunctionality due to the fact that those functions were driven by varied functional strategies of different plant species. We argue that maximizing forest complexity could act as a viable strategy to maximizing forest multifunctionality, while also promoting biodiversity conservation to mitigate climate change effects.

However, knowledge about the interacting effects of the timing of drought and the development stage of the vegetation during the growing season is still scarce, thus limiting our ability to accurately predict forage quantity losses. To investigate plant community responses to drought seasonality (early-vs. late-season), we established a drought experiment in two permanent grasslands of the Swiss Jura Mountains that are used for forage production. We measured three plant functional traits, including two leaf traits related to plant economics (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC) and one hydraulic trait related to physiological function (predicted percentage loss of hydraulic conductance, PLCp), of the most abundant species, and plant above-ground biomass production. Plant species composition was also determined to calculate community-weighted mean (CWM) traits. First, we observed that CWM trait values strongly varied during the growing season. Second, we found that late-season drought had stronger effects on CWM trait values than early-season drought and that the plant hydraulic trait was the most variable functional trait. Using a structural equation model, we also showed that reduction in soil moisture had no direct impacts on above-ground biomass production. Instead, we observed that the drought-induced decrease in above-ground biomass production was mediated by a higher CWM PLCp (i.e. higher risk of hydraulic failure) and lower CWM SLA under drought. Change in CWM SLA in response to drought was the best predictor of community above-ground biomass production. Our findings reveal the importance of drought timing together with the plant trait responses to assess drought impacts on grassland biomass production and suggest that incorporating these factors into mechanistic models could considerably improve predictions of climate change impacts.","[Vitra, Amarante; Signarbieux, Constant; Lamacque, Lia; Buttler, Alexandre; Mariotte, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Vitra, Amarante; Signarbieux, Constant; Buttler, Alexandre; Mariotte, Pierre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Deleglise, Claire; Meisser, Marco] Agroscope, Grazing Syst Grp, Route Duillier 50, CH-1260 Nyon, Switzerland; [Deleglise, Claire] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Irstea, LESSEM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Risch, Anita C.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Community Ecol, Zuercherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Lamacque, Lia] Univ Clermont Auvergne, INRA, PIAF, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Lamacque, Lia] ITEIPMAI, F-26740 Domaine De La Vesc, Montboucher Sur, France; [Delzon, Sylvain] Univ Bordeaux 1, UB, INRA, UMR BIOGECO, Bat B2,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France; [Buttler, Alexandre] Univ Franche Comte, Lab Chronoenvironm, UMR CNRS 6249, UFR Sci & Tech, 16 Route Gray, F-25030 Besancon, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; INRAE; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Universite de Franche-Comte","Vitra, A (autor correspondente), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Lab Ecol Syst ECOS, Stn 2, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Vitra, A (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Site Lausanne,Case Postale 96, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",amarante.vitra@epfl.ch,"Signarbieux, Constant/C-6564-2015; Risch, Anita C./A-9836-2012; Vitra, Amarante/AAZ-3717-2021; Mariotte, Pierre/G-4798-2011","Signarbieux, Constant/0000-0001-7780-5366; Risch, Anita C./0000-0003-0531-8336; Vitra, Amarante/0000-0003-4943-1170; Mariotte, Pierre/0000-0001-8570-8742; Deleglise, Claire/0000-0001-6119-8311",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [CR31I3_156282/1]; 'Investments for the Future' programme from the French National Agency for Research [ANR-10-EQPX-16]; Cluster of Excellence COTE (DEFI project) [ANR-10-LABX-45],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); 'Investments for the Future' programme from the French National Agency for Research(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Cluster of Excellence COTE (DEFI project),"This study is part of the GrassAlt project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), grant no CR31I3_156282/1.

However, many predictive trait-based models that emphasize environmental filtering have implicitly assumed that traits exhibit unimodal distributions among individuals within communities centred on an optimal trait value. Does accounting for more complex, multimodal trait distributions among individuals in a community improve predictions of species abundances and functional diversity along environmental gradients? LocationFranz Josef soil chronosequence, central Westland, New Zealand. MethodsLeaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations from 23 woody plant species were modelled as functions of soil total N and P from eight sites of declining soil P. We compared predictions to observations of species abundances and functional diversity along the soil chronosequence using two modelling approaches: (i) the standard application of the hierarchical Bayesian Traitspace model that assumes unimodally distributed traits at each point along the gradient, and (ii) a modified application of the model that accounts for multimodal trait distributions within each community. ResultsSoil P was the strongest predictor of traits and species abundances. The strength of the environmental filter of leaf traits changed along this gradient, as evidenced by highly constrained variances and low modality of the trait distribution at low soil P, and high variance and multimodality at high soil P. Both modelling approaches predicted species abundances that were significantly correlated with observations, but the multimodal approach significantly improved predictions of species abundances and functional diversity. ConclusionsOur results indicate that predictive models that emphasize environmental filtering over niche differentiation by assuming unimodal trait distributions can be more parsimonious than more complex approaches, especially when predicting species abundances along strong environmental gradients. However, models need to account for trait multimodality if they are to accurately replicate spatial patterns in functional diversity. This is important since functional diversity may be a key predictor of ecosystem function and resilience to global change.","[Laughlin, Daniel C.] Univ Waikato, Environm Res Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Joshi, Chaitanya] Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Richardson, Sarah J.; Peltzer, Duane A.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Mason, Norman W.

By considering the phylogenetic history of species, PD broadly summarizes the trait space within a community. This covers amongst others complex physiological or biochemical traits that are often not considered in estimates of functional diversity, but may be important for the understanding of community assembly and the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions. In this study we analyzed the relationship between PD of plant communities and land-use intensification in 150 local grassland plots in three regions in Germany. Specifically we asked whether PD decreases with land-use intensification and if so, whether the relationship is robust across different regions. Overall, we found that species richness decreased along land-use gradients the results however differed for common and rare species assemblages. PD only weakly decreased with increasing land-use intensity. The strength of the relationship thereby varied among regions and PD metrics used. From our results we suggest that there is no general relationship between PD and land-use intensification probably due to lack of phylogenetic conservatism in land- use sensitive traits. Nevertheless, we suggest that depending on specific regional idiosyncrasies the consideration of PD as a complement to other measures of diversity can be useful.","[Egorov, Eugen; Braendle, Martin] Univ Marburg, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Marburg, Germany; [Prati, Daniel; Fischer, Markus; Schmitt, Barbara; Blaser, Stefan] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Durka, Walter; Michalski, Stefan] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Egorov, E (autor correspondente), Univ Marburg, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, Marburg, Germany.",eugen.egorov@staff.uni-marburg.de,"Durka, Walter/E-4667-2010; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008","Durka, Walter/0000-0002-6611-2246; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355; Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900",DFG (German Research Foundation) [BR 1967/9-1],DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The DFG (German Research Foundation; http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp) funded the study in the framework of the Biodiversity Exploratories SSP 1374 Infrastructure-Biodiversity-Exploratories''(BR 1967/9-1).

We review plant competition in water-limited environments with focus on temporal niche dynamics and examine implications for diversity-productivity relationships and the response of ecosystem productivity to changes in water availability. The main theses under examination are that (i) plant functional types (PFTs) have distinct resource pulse use and coexist through mechanism of temporal resource use complementarity; and (ii) species of same PFT (functionally redundant species) coexist through distinct recruitment niches. 2. In water-limited systems, opportunities for plant resource uptake and growth fluctuate through time, dependent on precipitation patterns. Species differ in the sensitivities of germination, seedling mortality and adult productivity to pulses of water availability, and this generates opportunity for temporal niche diversification. We illustrate this in two case studies. 3. Case study I. Savannas: This is an example of niche separation between two distinct plant functional types (PFTs), trees and grasses. Several models suggest that the two PF s have complementary resource pulse use, which regulates their abundances, but other models suggest that tree abundance is regulated by the narrow recruitment niche of trees. Overly restrictive recruitment niches can cause a mismatch between resource availability, PF composition and ecosystem productivity. 4. Case study II. The tropical dry forest: Here, we examine niche separation between closely related species of same PFT. These species commonly have distinct temporal recruitment niches based on differences in seed and seedling traits. A diversification of recruitment niches may be necessary for sympatric speciation and has the effect of broadening of the recruitment 'portfolio' of a phylogenetic lineage and PFT. 5. Synthesis: Functional diversity, characterized by differences in adult resource use, optimizes ecosystem function in a pulsed resource environment only if PF abundances are regulated by adult resource use. Regulation through recruitment niches tends to uncouple plant productivity from resource availability.

Our understanding of how functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies of trees predicts aboveground biomass across forest strata (i.e. overstorey and understorey) remains unclear. Aboveground biomass, community-weighted mean (CWM - functional identity) of trait values (6 leaf and 2 stem traits), and soil physicochemical properties were estimated for 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. We used multiple linear regressions models to relate aboveground biomass to CWM indices at overstorey and understorey strata separately, and whole-community level. We finally employed the structural equation model to test for the effects of overstorey on understorey strata, in addition to the effects of soil physicochemical properties. Forest strata optimal models showed that overstorey strata had high aboveground biomass when they are dominated by functional identity of tree height, whereas high aboveground biomass in understorey strata was driven by functional identity of dense wooded conservative strategy. Whole-community optimal model showed that communities dominated by functional identity of leaf dry matter content and mean leaf area had high aboveground biomass. Aboveground biomass was negatively related to soil nutrients across forest strata and whole-community level. The structural equation model showed that CWM of overstorey tree height did not affect understorey functional identity and aboveground biomass, when soil physicochemical properties were accounted. Soil nutrients had positive effect on functional identity of overstorey tree height whereas negative effect on functional identity of understorey dense-wooded strategy. This study highlights the fundamental roles of forest strata where overstorey and understorey strata contribute to their corresponding aboveground biomass with contrasting functional strategies across a range of soil nutrients. High aboveground biomass was potentially driven by functional identity of tree height through making use of plentiful soil nutrients at overstorey strata, whereas by conservative strategy at understorey strata through enduring nutrient-poor soils. To better understand the roles of functional identity of conservative and acquisitive strategies in driving ecosystem functions, it is worth to analyse forest strata separately.","[Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Yan, ER (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",eryan@des.ecnu.edu.cn,"Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; ER, Yan/HLX-3797-2023","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670438, 31270475]; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements,"The authors would like to thank Min Guo, Qiang Zhong, Meng Kang, Yue Xu, Yilu Xu, Xiaodong Yang, Haixia Huang, Zhihao Zhang, Baowei Sun, Wenji Ma, Qingru Shi, Yantao, Zhao, Qingqing Zhang, Mingshan Xu, and Liuli Zhou for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

In the present study we assessed the effects of plant diversity, in terms of species richness, functional group composition and functional trait diversity, on the spatial stability of net primary productivity (NPP) following nitrogen and phosphorus application. In addition, we explored how functional traits at the species level contribute to the spatial stability of NPP. The results support the hypothesis that greater diversity leads to higher spatial stability. This relationship was highly dependent on soil nutrient availability, and increasing species richness or functional trait diversity significantly increased spatial variation of NPP under a high N fertilisation level. The effects of high mineral fertilisation rates may perhaps have masked the effects of plant diversity. Although species richness or functional trait diversity of the original and modified communities from which species with particular functional traits had been removed were significantly different, there were no differences in the coefficients of variation in the NPP of those communities. The lack of difference demonstrated that the relationship between spatial variability and biodiversity depended on the measure of diversity applied and that the functional group composition exerted a stronger effect than other diversity measures. Further analyses revealed that spatial stability of NPP was enhanced with increased diversity in vegetative plant height, rooting depth and the presence of legume, and diminished with diversity in the root system type and life cycle under some fertilisation treatments. The present study demonstrates that the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is variable with different diversity, identity and environmental factors. Evaluating the contribution of particular traits to community stability will ultimately help us better understand the mechanisms underlying the diversity-stability relationship.","[Na, Zhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining 810008, Peoples R China; [Na, Zhao; Shao Xinqing; Kun, Wang] China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang Zhengwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Na, Zhao] Guyuan State Key Monitoring & Res Stn Grassland E, Guyuan 076550, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS","Kun, W (autor correspondente), China Agr Univ, Dept Grassland Sci, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",wangkun@cau.edu.cn,"Wang, Zhengwen/A-8292-2011",,National Key Basic Research Development Project [2006AA10Z250]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC 30870422],National Key Basic Research Development Project(National Basic Research Program of China); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by grants from the National Key Basic Research Development Project (2006AA10Z250) and National Science Foundation of China (NSFC 30870422).

We review plant competition in water-limited environments with focus on temporal niche dynamics and examine implications for diversity-productivity relationships and the response of ecosystem productivity to changes in water availability. The main theses under examination are that (i) plant functional types (PFTs) have distinct resource pulse use and coexist through mechanism of temporal resource use complementarity; and (ii) species of same PFT (functionally redundant species) coexist through distinct recruitment niches. 2. In water-limited systems, opportunities for plant resource uptake and growth fluctuate through time, dependent on precipitation patterns. Species differ in the sensitivities of germination, seedling mortality and adult productivity to pulses of water availability, and this generates opportunity for temporal niche diversification. We illustrate this in two case studies. 3. Case study I. Savannas: This is an example of niche separation between two distinct plant functional types (PFTs), trees and grasses. Several models suggest that the two PF s have complementary resource pulse use, which regulates their abundances, but other models suggest that tree abundance is regulated by the narrow recruitment niche of trees. Overly restrictive recruitment niches can cause a mismatch between resource availability, PF composition and ecosystem productivity. 4. Case study II. The tropical dry forest: Here, we examine niche separation between closely related species of same PFT. These species commonly have distinct temporal recruitment niches based on differences in seed and seedling traits. A diversification of recruitment niches may be necessary for sympatric speciation and has the effect of broadening of the recruitment 'portfolio' of a phylogenetic lineage and PFT. 5. Synthesis: Functional diversity, characterized by differences in adult resource use, optimizes ecosystem function in a pulsed resource environment only if PF abundances are regulated by adult resource use. Regulation through recruitment niches tends to uncouple plant productivity from resource availability. However, we hypothesize that a diversification of recruitment niches within PF s may help alleviate recruitment limitations and help communities attain a PF composition that optimizes resource use and permits adaptation to climate change.","[Schwinning, Susanne] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Kelly, Colleen K.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England",Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; University of Oxford,"Schwinning, S (autor correspondente), Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",schwinn@txstate.edu,"Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291",,,,NA,129,37,40,2,165,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, whether tree diversity is able to increase the stability of forest growth to changes in climate is still an open question. We addressed this question using 36,378 permanent forest plots from National Forest Inventories of Spain and Qu,bec (Eastern Canada), covering five of the most important climate types where forests grow on Earth and a large temperature and precipitation gradient. The plots were used to compute forest productivity (aboveground woody biomass increment) and functional diversity (based on the functional traits of species). Divergence from normal levels of precipitation (dryer or wetter than 30-year means) and temperature (warmer or colder) were computed for each plot from monthly temperature and precipitation means. Other expected drivers of forest growth were also included. Our results show a significant impact of climate divergences on forest productivity, but not always in the expected direction. Furthermore, although functional trait diversity had a general positive impact on forest productivity under normal conditions, this effect was not maintained in stands having suffered from temperature divergence (i.e., warmer conditions). Contrary to our expectations, we found that tree diversity did not result in more stable forest's growth conditions during changes in climate. These results could have important implications for the future dynamics and management of mixed forests worldwide under climate change.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, CFR, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Vayreda, Jordi; Coll, Lluis; Retana, Javier] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Vayreda, Jordi; Coll, Lluis; Retana, Javier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Coll, Lluis] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn EAGROF, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Coll, Lluis] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Messier, Christian] UQO, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universitat de Lleida; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); University of Quebec,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, CFR, POB 8888, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,"Coll, Lluís/E-8724-2015; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Vayreda, Jordi/U-8172-2017","Coll, Lluís/0000-0002-8035-5949; Vayreda, Jordi/0000-0002-9538-7361",NEWFORESTS program; project EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [AGL2015-629 70425-R]; NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth,"NEWFORESTS program; project EST_RES - Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)); NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth","This research was supported by the NEWFORESTS program, the project EST_RES (AGL2015-629 70425-R) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, and the NSERC/Hydro-Quebec Chair in controlling tree growth.

Is the effect of functional diversity on complementarity greater when species evenness is higher? Does functional dominance play an important role in resource use when species evenness is low? LocationAn arable field in Linhai City, Zhejiang Province, China. MethodsWe assembled experimental plant communities with different species richness (one, two, four, eight and 12 species) and evenness (low and high). In each community, we quantified light interception efficiency (LIE) and light complementarity index (LC) to reflect light use. We measured four functional traits related to light capture to quantify functional diversity and functional dominance. We then tested effects of observed species richness, functional diversity and functional dominance on LIE, LC and above-ground biomass in the low and high evenness communities. ResultsFunctional diversity was positively related to LIE, LC and above-ground biomass in the high evenness communities, but not in the low evenness communities. In contrast, functional dominance was positively related to LIE and negatively related to LC in the low evenness communities, but not in the high evenness communities. Moreover, functional dominance had a larger promotion to above-ground biomass in the low evenness communities. Observed species richness and evenness had a significant interactive effect on LIE and LC. LIE of a species mixture of the low evenness communities was positively correlated with LIE of the monoculture consisting of the species with the highest initial abundance in the species mixture, while LC of a species mixture of the low evenness communities was negatively correlated with it. ConclusionsFunctional diversity and functional dominance play a crucial role in light complementary use of plant communities, and their effects on light complementarity are mediated by species evenness. Thus, interactions of functional traits and evenness may greatly affect ecosystem functioning.","[Wang, Jiang; Yu, Fei-Hai] Taizhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China",Taizhou University,"Wang, J; Yu, FH (autor correspondente), Taizhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.",wangjiang@tzc.edu.cn; feihaiyu@126.com,"Yu, Fei-Hai/O-9395-2016","Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC1201100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31000256, 31400423]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China [Y13C030003]","National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","National Key Research and Development Program, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC1201100; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31000256 and 31400423; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China, Grant/Award Number: Y13C030003",NA,58,3,3,5,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Within this biome, inselbergs are isolated granitic and gneiss rocks that rise sharply above the lowland surrounding forests. Due to prevailing stressful conditions and resource paucity of inselbergs, distinguished plant communities are formed in these rocky-associated vegetation, which comprise unusually high levels of endemic and threatened species. Here, we evaluated the importance of competitiveness: stress-tolerance: ruderalism ecological strategies in different vegetation patches on the inselberg, tested for a connection between patch structure and functional traits, and compared the variation in functional traits between native and an exotic species, which represents a major threat to inselberg communities. Despite the stressful conditions of inselbergs, we found a relatively high diversity of ecological strategies, but most species and patches lied between the S and C strategy. The invasive Melinis repens, in turn, was functionally distinctive from native communities, with the predominance of traits associated with ruderalism. We also found that most functional traits significantly correlated with at least one environmental driver, highlighting their role in structuring plant communities in this heterogeneous environment. Since inselberg patches were spatially heterogeneous, and the variation in resource availability implies in favouring different ecological strategies, some patch types were more invasive-prone than others. Our data provide significant advances for identifying the environmental drivers of biological invasion in resource-limited environments. We argue that further trait-based approaches will become critical for developing conservation and management strategies for inselberg plant communities, especially in the context of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation of the Atlantic forest.","[de Paula, Luiza F.

However, the link between water-use strategy and ecosystem vulnerability to meteorological droughts is poorly established. Using the global flux observations, historic hydroclimatic data, remote-sensing products, and plant functional-trait archive, we identified potentially vulnerable ecosystems, examining how ecosystem water-use strategy, quantified by the percentage bias (delta) of the empirical canopy conductance sensitivity to VPD relative to the theoretical value, mediated ecosystem responses to droughts. We found that prevailing soil water availability substantially impacted delta in dryland regions where ecosystems with insufficient soil moisture usually showed conservative water-use strategy, while ecosystems in humid regions exhibited more pronounced climatic adaptability. Hyposensitive and hypersensitive ecosystems, classified based on delta falling below or above the theoretical sensitivity, respectively, achieved similar net ecosystem productivity during droughts, employing different structural and functional strategies. However, hyposensitive ecosystems, risking their hydraulic system with a permissive water-use strategy, were unable to recover from droughts as quickly as hypersensitive ones. Our findings highlight that processed-based models predicting current functions and future performance of vegetation should account for the greater vulnerability of hyposensitive ecosystems to intensifying atmospheric and soil droughts.","[Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hang; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Xiaoyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Comb, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Oren, Ram] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Duke University; Duke University; University of Helsinki,"Zhang, ZQ (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jixian Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, CNERN, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Oren, R (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Oren, R (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",zhqzhang@bjfu.edu.cn; ramoren@duke.edu,"Oren, Ram/AAC-5326-2019","Oren, Ram/0000-0002-5654-1733; Xu, Hang/0000-0002-6661-3139",Academy of Finland [337549]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M710407]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2016VBA036]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BLX202108]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF1302501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31872711],Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Academy of Finland, Grant/Award Number: 337549; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2022M710407; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative, Grant/Award Number: 2016VBA036; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: BLX202108; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2022YFF1302501; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31872711",NA,101,0,0,20,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

However, there is a lack of work examining how dominant species identity affects trait-productivity relationships. The productivity of 12 pasture mixtures was determined in a 3-year field experiment. The mixtures were based on either the winter-active ryegrass (Lolium perenne) or winter-dormant tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). Different mixtures were obtained by adding forb, legume, and grass species that differ in key leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits to the basic two-species dominant grass-white clover (Trifolium repens) mixtures. We tested for correlations between community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values, functional diversity, and productivity across all plots and within those based on either ryegrass or tall fescue. The winter-dormant forb species (chicory and plantain) had leaf traits consistent with high relative growth rates both per unit leaf area (high leaf thickness) and per unit leaf dry weight (low leaf dry matter content). Together, the two forb species achieved reasonable abundance when grown with either base grass (means of 36% and 53% of total biomass, respectively, with ryegrass tall fescue), but they competed much more strongly with tall fescue than with ryegrass. Consequently, they had a net negative impact on productivity when grown with tall fescue, and a net positive effect when grown with ryegrass. Strongly significant relationships between productivity and CWM values for LES traits were observed across ryegrass-based mixtures, but not across tall fescue-based mixtures. Functional diversity did not have a significant positive effect on productivity for any of the traits. The results show dominant species identity can strongly modify trait-productivity relationships in intensively grazed pastures. This was due to differences in the intensity of competition between dominant species and additional species, suggesting that resource-use complementarity is a necessary prerequisite for trait-productivity relationships.","[Mason, Norman W.

The Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) literature proposes that ecosystem functioning increases with biodiversity because of complementarity in resource-use among species, associated with functional diversity. In this study, we challenge the trait-based ecology framework by comparing congeneric exotic (European) and native (North American) tree species showing similar resource-use functional trait values. The trait-based framework suggests that two functionally equivalent species should play similar roles in a community, resulting in similar interactions and performances. However, several studies showed that when growing in mixtures, exotic species that are functionally equivalent to native species benefitted from enemy release, resulting in a reduced apparent competition. We hypothesize that exotic species should be more productive than native species because the exotic species benefit from reduced apparent competition due to enemy release rather than from possessing more competitive resource-use functional traits. 2. We study a diversity experiments, part of the International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT), composed of two identical sites, each with two orthogonal diversity gradients: species richness and functional diversity. The functional gradient consists of species combinations of equal richness but increasing functional diversity, using different combinations of species provenance to assess the relationship between productivity, functional diversity and species provenance, independently of species richness. We grew a total of 12 species (six native and six exotic) in different combinations of one-, two- and six-species mixtures. The exotic species were selected based on their functional equivalence to their native congeneric species. 3. Eight years after planting, we found that exotic species were more productive than native species, but only at high functional diversity. Results indicate that exotic species overall benefit from a reduced apparent competition, and that exotic-increased productivity at high functional diversity is consistent with the enemy release hypothesis. 4. After 8 years, exotic species were more productive overall than their native counterparts, but only in the most functionally diverse communities. This study represents a first step in understanding the relative importance of complementarity in resource-use and apparent competition in a context of an exotic tree species invasion.

Here, we test whether leaf traits consistently respond to experimental treatments across 27 globally distributed grassland sites across 4 continents. We find that specific leaf area (leaf area per unit mass)-a commonly measured morphological trait inferring shifts between plant growth strategies-did not respond to up to four years of soil nutrient additions. Leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations increased in response to the addition of each respective soil nutrient. We found few significant changes in leaf traits when vertebrate herbivores were excluded in the short-term. Leaf nitrogen and potassium concentrations were positively correlated with species turnover, suggesting that interspecific trait variation was a significant predictor of leaf nitrogen and potassium, but not of leaf phosphorus concentration. Climatic conditions and pretreatment soil nutrient levels also accounted for significant amounts of variation in the leaf traits measured. Overall, we find that leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are not appropriate indicators of plant response to anthropogenic perturbations in grasslands.","[Firn, Jennifer; McGree, James M.; Porter, Erica; Allen, Charlotte; Moromizato, Karine H.] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Harvey, Eric] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Flores-Moreno, Habacuc; Borer, Elizabeth T.; Seabloom, Eric W.; Sullivan, Lauren L.; Wragg, Peter D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schuetz, Martin; Risch, Anita C.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buckley, Yvonne M.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Zool, Dublin, Ireland; [La Pierre, Kimberly J.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [MacDougall, Andrew M.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO Land & Water, Floreat, WA, Australia; [Stevens, Carly J.; Broadbent, Arthur A.

However, the relative importance of taxonomic diversity and functional characteristics (including functional dominance and functional diversity) in maintaining community productivity and the underlying mechanisms (including selection and complementarity effects) of the relationship between diversity and community productivity have been widely controversial. In this study, 194 sites were surveyed in five grassland types along a precipitation gradient in the Inner Mongolia grassland of China. The relationships between taxonomic diversity (species richness and the Shannon-Weaver index), functional dominance (the community-weighted mean of four plant traits), functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy), and community aboveground biomass were analyzed. The results showed that (1) taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass all increased from low to high precipitation grassland types; (2) there were significant positive linear relationships between taxonomic diversity, functional dominance, functional diversity, and community aboveground biomass; (3) the effect of functional characteristics on community aboveground biomass is greater than that of taxonomic diversity; and (4) community aboveground biomass depends on the community-weighted mean plant height, which explained 57.1% of the variation in the community aboveground biomass. Our results suggested that functional dominance rather than taxonomic diversity and functional diversity mainly determines community productivity and that the selection effect plays a dominant role in maintaining the relationship between biodiversity and community productivity in the Inner Mongolia grassland.","[Zhang, Qing; Li, Frank Yonghong; Niu, Jianming; Kang, Sarula; Ma, Wenjing] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Buyantuev, Alexander] SUNY Albany, Dept Geog & Planning, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ding, Yong] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Grassland Res Inst, Hohhot, Peoples R China","Inner Mongolia University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS","Niu, JM (autor correspondente), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",jmniu2005@163.com,"Niu, Jianming/K-3597-2019; Li, Frank Yonghong/AAN-3093-2020; Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019; Buyantuev, Alexander/L-9887-2013","Li, Frank Yonghong/0000-0002-5137-8017; Buyantuev, Alexander/0000-0003-1670-0741; Zhang, Qing/0000-0002-3489-1417","National Basic Research Program of China [31200414, 31560180]; Key Basic Research Development Program of China [2012CB722201, 2014CB138802]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Key Basic Research Development Program of China,"National Basic Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 31200414 and 31560180; State Key Basic Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2012CB722201 and 2014CB138802.",NA,58,44,49,34,193,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Given increasing environmental variability and uncertainty under global change, an emerging question is how biodiversity influences the stability of multiple functions (i.e. multifunctional stability). We currently know little, however, about the determinants and mechanisms of multifunctional stability, which is of practical importance for ensuring the sustainable provision of multiple functions. Here, we examined mechanisms contributing to stability (quantified as the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation) of multiple functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration, including plant above-ground and below-ground productivity, litter production, gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration, in a large grassland biodiversity experiment in Inner Mongolia. We found that community-wide species asynchrony was a strong driver to stabilize multiple functions. Community-wide asynchrony mediated the positive effects of species richness and response diversity (describing how species with similar effects on ecosystem function respond differently to environmental change) on multifunctional stability. However, species richness had a negative direct effect on multifunctional stability because, although it increased the averaged temporal mean of multiple functions, it strongly increased the averaged temporal standard deviation of multiple functions. The overall effects of species richness on multifunctional stability were thus negative, whereas those of response diversity were positive. Synthesis. The studied ecosystem functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration are important in natural grasslands across the world. We conclude that species asynchrony and response diversity, rather than species richness, are key to the ecosystem multifunctional stability. The loss of response diversity and compensatory mechanisms would likely reduce the long-term sustainability of grasslands in the face of global change.","[Sasaki, Takehiro; Lu, Xiaoming; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sasaki, Takehiro] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Lu, Xiaoming; Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hirota, Mitsuru] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Yokohama National University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Tsukuba","Sasaki, T (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Sasaki, T (autor correspondente), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",sasaki-takehiro-kw@ynu.ac.jp,"Lu, Xiaoming/AAE-6302-2022","Lu, Xiaoming/0000-0001-7380-0699; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25712036]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of the Environment; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25712036] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of the Environment(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 25712036; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of the Environment",NA,104,35,37,35,199,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Herbs are a critical component of the plant community of dryland ecosystems, but the importance of different life form groups of herbs is often overlooked in experiments on biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality. Hence, little is known about how the multiple attributes of diversity of different life form groups of herbs affect changes to the multifunctionality of ecosystems. MethodsWe investigated geographic patterns of herb diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality along a precipitation gradient of 2100 km in Northwest China, and assessed the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional attributes of different life form groups of herbs on the multifunctionality. ResultsWe found that subordinate (richness effect) species of annual herbs and dominant (mass ratio effect) species of perennial herbs were crucial for driving multifunctionality. Most importantly, the multiple attributes (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) of herb diversity enhanced the multifunctionality. The functional diversity of herbs provided greater explanatory power than did taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. In addition, the multiple attribute diversity of perennial herbs contributed more than annual herbs to multifunctionality. ConclusionsOur findings provide insights into previously neglected mechanisms by which the diversity of different life form groups of herbs affect ecosystem multifunctionality. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality, and will ultimately contribute to multifunctional conservation and restoration programs in dryland ecosystems.","[Guo, Hao; Zhou, Xiao-bing; Tao, Ye; Yin, Jin-fei; Zhang, Lan; Guo, Xing; Liu, Chao-hong; Zhang, Yuan-ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Guo, Hao; Zhou, Xiao-bing; Tao, Ye; Yin, Jin-fei; Zhang, Lan; Guo, Xing; Zhang, Yuan-ming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zhang, YM (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YM (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ymzhang@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer A Project [XDA2005020402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U2003214]; special project of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2019QZKK0502],Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer A Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); special project of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology,"This research was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Pioneer A Project (XDA2005020402), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2003214) and a special project of the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (2019QZKK0502).",NA,87,0,0,11,11,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Here, we modelled the effects of abiotic (i.e. climate, soil and plot physical conditions) and biotic [i.e. FTD, CWM of conservative traits (CWMCT), CWM of acquisitive traits (CWMAT) and functional dominance (FunDom; based on CWM of plant maximum height or diameter)] factors on AGB in 76 forest metacommunities (from 24 studies). Using multiple linear regression models and piecewise structural equation modeling (pSEM), we tested the hypothesis that both abiotic and biotic factors regulate AGB but that the mass ratio mechanism underpins AGB of metacommunities in global forests better than the niche complementarity mechanism. We found that abiotic and biotic factors contributed 45.39% and 54.07%, respectively, to the explained variance in AGB (R-2 = 0.59), and as such, abiotic factors shaped FTD (R-2 = 0.42-0.48), CWMCT (R-2 = 0.33-0.36), CWMAT (R-2 = 0.27-0.33) and FunDom (R-2 = 0.59-0.61) through divergent effect sizes and directions. The final best-fitted pSEM showed that FunDom increased (beta = 0.49) but CWMCT (beta = -0.35) and CWMAT (beta = -0.11) decreased AGB (R-2 = 0.52) as compared to the negligible effect of FTD (beta = 0.04). This study supports the mass ratio effect, specifically the overruling role of tall-stature or dominant trees on AGB, at a macroecological scale, and hence, suggests that a suitable species' functional strategy is important to promote carbon sequestration in forest metacommunities that underpins human well-being. We expect that our study will advance the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning at a macroecological scale by using the metacommunity concept and approach.","[Wang, Li-Qiu; Ali, Arshad] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Forest Ecol Res Grp, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China",Nanjing Forestry University; Hebei University,"Ali, A (autor correspondente), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Resources Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",arshadforester@gmail.com,"Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; ",Jiangsu Science and Technology Special Project [BX2019084]; Metasequoia Faculty Research Startup Funding at Nanjing Forestry University [163010230]; Faculty Startup Research Funding for establishing Forest Ecology Research Group at Hebei University [521100221033],Jiangsu Science and Technology Special Project; Metasequoia Faculty Research Startup Funding at Nanjing Forestry University; Faculty Startup Research Funding for establishing Forest Ecology Research Group at Hebei University,"This study was funded by the Jiangsu Science and Technology Special Project (grant no.

Previous studies show considerable variation across terrestrial herbaceous ecosystems in the magnitude of species loss following nitrogen (N) enrichment. What controls this variation remains unknown. We present results from 23 N-addition experiments across North America, representing a range of climatic, soil and plant community properties, to determine conditions that lead to greater diversity decline. Species loss in these communities ranged from 0 to 65% of control richness. Using hierarchical structural equation modelling, we found greater species loss in communities with a lower soil cation exchange capacity, colder regional temperature, and larger production increase following N addition, independent of initial species richness, plant productivity, and the relative abundance of most plant functional groups. Our results indicate sensitivity to N addition is co-determined by environmental conditions and production responsiveness, which overwhelm the effects of initial community structure and composition.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Univ Texas, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Univ Houston, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77204 USA; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; US Geol Survey, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of New Mexico; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Clark, CM (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",clark134@umn.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014; Grace, James/B-8472-2009; Suding, Katharine/O-6290-2017","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892; Grace, James/0000-0001-6374-4726; Suding, Katharine/0000-0002-5357-0176",,,,NA,67,252,276,9,327,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The GEMINI model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance.

Here, we test the effects of abiotic factors (light variation, caused by logging disturbance, and soil fertility) and biotic factors (species richness and functional trait composition) on biomass stocks (above-ground biomass, fine root biomass), SOM and productivity in a relatively monodominant Guyanese tropical rainforest. This forest grows on nutrient-poor soils and has few species that contribute most to total abundance. We, therefore, expected strong effects of soil fertility and species' traits that determine resource acquisition and conservation, but not of diversity. We evaluated 6years of data for 30 0.4-ha plots and tested hypotheses using structural equation models. Disturbance increased productivity but decreased above-ground biomass stocks. Soil phosphorus (P) enhanced above-ground biomass and productivity, whereas soil nitrogen reduced fine root biomass. In contrast to expectations, trait values representing acquisitive strategies (e.g. high leaf nutrient concentration) increased biomass stocks, possibly because they indicate higher nutrient absorption and thus higher biomass build-up. However, under harsh conditions where biomass increase is slow, acquisitive trait values may increase respiration and vulnerability to hazards and therefore increase biomass loss. As expected, species richness did not affect productivity. We conclude that light availability (through disturbance) and soil fertilityespecially Pstrongly limit forest biomass productivity and stocks in this Guyanese forest. Low P availability may cause strong environmental filtering, which in turn results in a small set of dominant species.

Early analyses of BEF used a modification of the evolutionary Price equation to partition effects of biodiversity into components of complementarity (species richness) and dominance (species composition). However, early experiments and data on BEF did not use information on species traits or relative abundances. Here we extend the Price partition of the total expression of a single trait (such as leaf area) between two communities into five additive components: 1) species richness; 2) average species trait expression; 3) relative abundance; 4) the combined effects of relative abundance and trait expression; 5) absolute abundance. When applied to presence-absence data with no trait variation, the method yields a result that is identical to the original Price partition into two components of complementarity and dominance. When applied to an analysis of relative abundance itself as a trait, our method quantifies the strength of species co-occurrences as a difference in Simpson diversity between the communities. We tested the new partition with artificial data sets and null model comparisons, and applied it to a long-term data set on plant succession. A key finding is that the effects of total abundance might be very important when comparing two communities, and possibly could account for results from previous studies in which complementarity emerged as an important contributor to BEF.","[Ulrich, Werner] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland; [Zaplata, Markus Klemens] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Fac Environm & Nat Sci, Cottbus, Germany; [Gotelli, Nicholas J.] Univ Vermont, Dept Biol, Burlington, VT USA",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; University of Vermont,"Ulrich, W (autor correspondente), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Ecol & Biogeog, Torun, Poland.",ulrichw@umk.pl,,"Gotelli, Nicholas J./0000-0002-5409-7456; Zaplata, Markus/0000-0001-7707-5578; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619",Polish National Science Centre [UMO-2017/27/B/NZ8/00316],Polish National Science Centre,WU acknowledges funding from the Polish National Science Centre (UMO-2017/27/B/NZ8/00316).,NA,55,1,1,9,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2022,2022,1,,,,NA,,,,10.1111/oik.08871,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08871,NA,nov.-21,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XY2DZ,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000714005600001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test how plant functional groups (FGs: graminoids, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes) and plant traits relate to PSF, we grew 48 grassland species in sterilized soil, sterilized soil with own species soil inoculum and sterilized soil with soil inoculum from all species, and quantified relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and per cent arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization (%AMF). Plant growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to sterilized soil (PSFsterilized) reflects net effects of all (generalist+specialized) soil biota. Growth response to the plant species' own soil biota relative to soil biota of all plant species (PSFaway) reveals effects of more specialized soil organisms. PSFsterilized showed that graminoids and small herbs have a negative and tall herbs a positive response to their own soil biota, whereas legumes responded neutrally. However, PSFaway showed that on average, all plant FGs benefitted from growing with other species' soil biota, suggesting that pathogens are more specialized than plant growth-promoting soil biota. Feedback to plant growth from all soil biota (PSFsterilized) was stronger than from more specialized soil biota (PSFaway) and could be predicted by SRL and especially by %AMF colonization. Species with high SRL and low %AMF colonization when grown in away soil experienced most negative soil feedback.Synthesis. Plant species from all plant FGs grow better in soil from other species because of less net negative effects of soil biota (in graminoids), or because of more net positive soil biota effects (in tall herbs). Explorative plant species (high SRL, low %AMF colonization) suffer most from negative feedback of all soil biota, whereas more resource conservative species (low SRL, high %AMF colonization) benefit from soil feedback of all soil biota. These findings help to understand replacement of explorative species during succession. Moreover, we suggest a potentially larger role for species with positive feedback than for species with negative feedback to contribute to maintain plant community productivity of diverse communities over time.","[Cortois, Roeland; van der Putten, Wim H.; De Deyn, Gerlinde B.] Nederlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Schroeder-Georgi, Thomas; Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Dept Special Bot & Funct Biodivers, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Schroeder-Georgi, Thomas; Weigelt, Alexandra] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [van der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ, Nematol Lab, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Leipzig University; Wageningen University & Research,"De Deyn, GB (autor correspondente), Nederlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.",gerlinde.dedeyn@wur.nl,"van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009; De Deyn, Gerlinde/AFI-8702-2022; De Deyn, Gerlinde/F-7080-2017; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442; De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912; De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1451]; NWO-ALW VIDI [864.11.003]; NWO [832.13.009],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); NWO-ALW VIDI; NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We are grateful to Amalia Castro and Nasir Uddin for practical assistance.

However, much of the evidence for this relationship is drawn from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments in which biodiversity loss is simulated by randomly assembling communities of varying species diversity, and ecosystem functions are measured. This random assembly has led some ecologists to question the relevance of biodiversity experiments to real-world ecosystems, where community assembly or disassembly may be non-random and influenced by external drivers, such as climate, soil conditions or land use. Here, we compare data from real-world grassland plant communities with data from two of the largest and longest-running grassland biodiversity experiments (the Jena Experiment in Germany and BioDIV in the United States) in terms of their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and functional-trait composition. We found that plant communities of biodiversity experiments cover almost all of the multivariate variation of the real-world communities, while also containing community types that are not currently observed in the real world. Moreover, they have greater variance in their compositional features than their real-world counterparts. We then re-analysed a subset of experimental data that included only ecologically realistic communities (that is, those comparable to real-world communities). For 10 out of 12 biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, biodiversity effects did not differ significantly between the full dataset of biodiversity experiments and the ecologically realistic subset of experimental communities. Although we do not provide direct evidence for strong or consistent biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in real-world communities, our results demonstrate that the results of biodiversity experiments are largely insensitive to the exclusion of unrealistic communities and that the conclusions drawn from biodiversity experiments are generally robust. By comparing data from real-world grassland communities with data from two of the longest-running grassland biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments, the authors show that conclusions derived from experimental systems are robust to the removal of unrealistic experimental communities.","[Jochum, Malte;

Recently, intraspecific diversity has been found to have similar effects, but because traits vary far less within a species than among species we have a much poorer understanding of the mechanisms by which intraspecific diversity affects ecosystem function. We explored the potential for identity recognition among the roots of different Pseudoroegneria spicata accessions to contribute to previously demonstrated overyielding in plots with high intraspecific richness of this species relative to monocultures. First, we found that when plants from different populations were planted together in pots the total biomass yield was 30 % more than in pots with two plants from the same population. Second, we found that the elongation rates of roots of Pseudoroegneria plants decreased more after contact with roots from another plant from the same population than after contact with roots from a plant from a different population. These results suggest the possibility of some form of detection and avoidance mechanism among more closely related Pseudoroegneria plants.

Here, we conducted an experimental study with labeled nitrogen in two types of soil (low and high nitrate conditions), investigating the effects of (1) the presence of Fallopia x bohemica on the traits of three native species (Humulus lupulus, Sambucus ebulus, and Urtica dioica) and (2) interspecific competition (monoculture of the invasive species, monoculture of the native species, and a mixture of invasive/native species) on nitrification, denitrification, and related microbial communities (i.e., functional gene abundances). We found that the species with the higher nitrate assimilation rate (U. dioica) was affected differently by the invasive species, with no effect or even an increase in aboveground biomass and number of leaves. F. x bohemica also decreased denitrification, but only in the soil with high nitrate concentrations. The impacts of the invasive species on nitrification and soil microorganisms depended on the native species and the soil type, suggesting that competition for nitrogen between plants and between plants and microorganisms is highly dependent on species traits and environmental conditions. This research highlights that studies looking at the impacts of invasive species on ecosystems should consider the plant-soil-microorganism complex as a whole.","[Cantarel, Amelie A.

This is because species use different resources (i.e. complementarity effect) or because species-rich communities include species with extreme functional traits (positive selection effect). We conducted two manipulative studies to separate the effects of functional richness and functional identity on the feeding efficiency (i.e. filtration rate) of suspension-feeding invertebrates growing on vertical surfaces. In addition, one experiment tested whether the density of organisms influences the effect of functional diversity. Monocultures and complete mixtures of functional types were fed with a solution of microalgae of different sizes (6 mu m-40 mu m). Experiments conducted at two locations, Helgoland and Plymouth, showed that functional identity had far larger effects on filtration rate than richness. Mixtures did not outperform the average monoculture or the best-performing monoculture and this pattern was independent on density. The high efficiency of one of the functional types in consuming most microalgae could have minimised the resource complementarity. The loss or gain of particular species may therefore have a stronger impact on the functioning of epibenthic communities than richness per se. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In theory, this approach has mainly focused on how extinction affects function, whereas dispersal limitation of ecosystem function has been rarely discussed. A handful of seed introduction experiments, as well as numerous observations of the effects of long-distance dispersal of alien species, indicate that ecosystem function may be strongly determined by dispersal limitation at the local, regional and/or global scales. We suggest that it is time to replace biodiversity manipulation experiments, based on random draw of species, with those addressing realistic scenarios of either extinction or dispersal. Experiments disentangling the dispersal limitation of ecosystem function should have to take into account the probability of arrival. The latter is defined as the probability that a propagule of a particular species will arrive at a particular community. Arrival probability depends on the dispersal ability and the number of propagules of a species, the distance a species needs to travel, and the permeability of the matrix landscape. Current databases, in particular those in northwestern and central Europe now enable robust estimation of arrival probability in plant communities. We suggest a general hypothesis claiming that dispersal limitation according to arrival probability will have ecosystem-level effects different from those arising due to random arrival. This hypothesis may be rendered more region-landscape-or ecosystem-specific by estimating arrival probabilities for different background conditions.","Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Zobel, M (autor correspondente), Univ Tartu, Inst Bot & Ecol, 40 Lai St, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",martin.zobel@ut.ee; maarja.opik@ut.ee; mari.moora@ut.ee; meelis.partel@ut.ee,"Öpik, Maarja/A-1765-2008; Zobel, Martin/H-1336-2015; Pärtel, Meelis/D-5493-2012; Moora, Mari/D-1961-2009","Öpik, Maarja/0000-0001-8025-7460; Zobel, Martin/0000-0001-7957-6704; Pärtel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Moora, Mari/0000-0002-4819-7506",,,,NA,60,39,42,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, anthropogenic pressure from intensified forest management, eutrophication, and climate change may alter the ecosystem functions of understory vegetation and services boreal forests provide. Swedish forests span long gradients of climate, nitrogen deposition, and management intensity. This makes them ideal to study how the species composition and functions of other, more pristine, boreal forests might change under increased anthropogenic pressure. Moreover, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) has collected systematic data on Swedish forest vegetation since the mid-20th century. We use this data to quantify changes in vegetation types between two periods, 1953-1962 and 2003-2012. The results show changes in forest understory vegetation since the 1950s at scales not previously documented in the boreal biome. The spatial extent of most vegetation types changed significantly. Shade-adapted and nutrient-demanding species (those with high specific leaf area) have become more common at the expense of light-demanding and nutrient-conservative (low specific leaf area) species. The cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs decreased dramatically. These effects were strongest where anthropogenic impacts were greatest, suggesting links to drivers such as nitrogen deposition and land-use change. These changes may impact ecosystem functions and services via effects on higher trophic levels and faster plant litter decomposition in the expanding vegetation types. This, in turn, may influence nutrient dynamics, and consequently ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.","[Hedwall, Per-Ola; Brunet, Jorg; Lindbladh, Matts] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Lena; Strengbom, Joachim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, POB 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Axelsson, Anna-Lena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Resource Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hedwall, PO (autor correspondente), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden.",per-ola.hedwall@slu.se,"Hedwall, Per-Ola/ABG-2195-2020; Strengbom, Joachim/AAE-7645-2022","Hedwall, Per-Ola/0000-0002-0120-7420; Strengbom, Joachim/0000-0002-1720-5016",Formas [217-2012-546],Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"The committed work by the staff at the Swedish NFI made this study possible.

Neither the functional nor the phylogenetic diversity showed a significant advantage in predicting aboveground biomass and biomass production (aboveground biomass increment) when compared with species richness.ContextConsistent conclusions have still not been reached regarding the relative importance of the different diversity indices in predicting biomass production. Furthermore, the effects of certain forest strata on the BEF relationship remain unclear.MethodsThe woody plant species in the study area were classified as two vertical strata and were referred to as the overstorey (trees with dbh>10cm) and understorey (trees with dbh10cm). The relationships between different metrics of tree diversity and biomass production were quantified using linear models. The set of the best predictors for tree biomass and productions were determined using a multi-model selection approach. The differences in diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships between the two forest vertical strata, and the effects of canopy trees on the understorey trees, were investigated using structural equation models.AimsThe relative importance of the species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity in predicting the aboveground biomass production (ABP) was examined to compare the potential of phylogenetic and functional diversity indices and species richness in predicting biomass productivity and compare the influence of niche complementarity, selection effects, or mass-ratio effects on aboveground biomass variables and to assess possible differences in the BEF relationships between the overstorey and understorey layers in the studied ecosystems. Also, this study investigated possible differences in the BEF relationships between the overstorey and understorey layers in the studied ecosystems.ResultsThe results confirmed a positive diversity-productivity relationship in the natural coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest. However, the relationship in the overstorey stratum was statistically stronger than that in the understorey layer. The combination of diversity indices and functional traits could explain more of the variations in the biomass and productivity than when examined separately. The correlation between the richness of the overstorey and understorey species was found to be positive. However, the aboveground woody biomass of the overstorey layer had negative effects on the understorey biomass.ConclusionIn summary, this study found a stronger positive correlation between the woody plant diversity and productivity in the overstorey than in the understorey stratum. These findings indicate that the BEF relationships are hierarchically dependent, and supported by niche complementarity. Also, a much weaker relationship was observed between the functional diversity and biomass production than between the species diversity and biomass production due to a selection effect. The aboveground woody biomass was found to be enhanced in communities dominated by functional traits correlated to smaller leaf areas, greater maximum tree heights, and higher leaf carbon content. These findings suggest that the BEF relationships were driven by a mass-ratio hypothesis.","[Xu, Wei; Luo, Weixue; Zhang, Chunyu; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [von Gadow, Klaus] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Zhang, Zhonghui] Jilin Prov Acad Forestry Sci, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University; University of Gottingen; Stellenbosch University,"Zhao, XH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, 35 Qinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",bfuz@163.com,"Zhang, Chun-yu/HDP-5776-2022; Zhang, Chunyu/GYA-2925-2022","Zhang, Chunyu/0000-0003-3091-5060",Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC0504104]; Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670643],Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan; Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (2017YFC0504104) and the Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670643).,NA,72,6,9,6,90,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Photosynthetic capacity was previously shown to increase as temperature declines with increasing elevation, counteracting enzyme-kinetic effects. Primary production declines, nonetheless, due to decreasing light availability. We aimed to predict leaf-trait and production gradients from first principles, using published data to test an emerging theory whereby photosynthetic traits and primary production depend on optimal acclimation and/or adaptation to environment. We re-analysed published data for 210 species at 25 sites, fitting linear relationships to elevation for both predicted and observed photosynthetic traits and primary production. Declining leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratio (chi) and increasing carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron-transport (J(max)) capacities with increasing elevation were predicted. Increases in leaf nitrogen content with elevation were explained by increasing V-cmax and leaf mass-per-area. Leaf and soil phosphorus covaried, but after controlling for elevation, no nutrient metric accounted for any additional variance in photosynthetic traits.

However, a comprehensive global analysis of nitrogen allocation in leaves for major processes with respect to different plant functional types (PFTs) is currently lacking. This study integrated observations from global databases with photosynthesis and respiration models to determine plant-functional-type-specific allocation patterns of leaf nitrogen for photosynthesis (Rubisco, electron transport, light absorption) and respiration (growth and maintenance), and by difference from observed total leaf nitrogen, an unexplained residual nitrogen pool. Based on our analysis, crops partition the largest fraction of nitrogen to photosynthesis (57%) and respiration (5%) followed by herbaceous plants (44% and 4%). Tropical broadleaf evergreen trees partition the least to photosynthesis (25%) and respiration (2%) followed by needle-leaved evergreen trees (28% and 3%). In trees (especially needle-leaved evergreen and tropical broadleaf evergreen trees) a large fraction (70% and 73%, respectively) of nitrogen was not explained by photosynthetic or respiratory functions. Compared to crops and herbaceous plants, this large residual pool is hypothesized to emerge from larger investments in cell wall proteins, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acid, CO2 fixation proteins (other than Rubisco), secondary compounds, and other proteins. Our estimates are different from previous studies due to differences in methodology and assumptions used in deriving nitrogen allocation estimates. Unlike previous studies, we integrate and infer nitrogen allocation estimates across multiple PFTs, and report substantial differences in nitrogen allocation across different PFTs. The resulting pattern of nitrogen allocation provides insights on mechanisms that operate at a cellular scale within leaves, and can be integrated with ecosystem models to derive emergent properties of ecosystem productivity at local, regional, and global scales.","[Ghimire, Bardan; Riley, William J.; Koven, Charles D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Halle Jena Leipzig, Germany; [Rogers, Alistair] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Environm & Climate Sci Dept, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55455 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Wright, Ian J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW, Australia",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Max Planck Society; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University; Macquarie University,"Riley, WJ (autor correspondente), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Earth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",wjriley@lbl.gov,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016; Rogers, Alistair/P-6185-2019; Koven, Charles/N-8888-2014; Rogers, Alistair/E-1177-2011; Wright, Ian J/G-4979-2012","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469; Rogers, Alistair/0000-0001-9262-7430; Koven, Charles/0000-0002-3367-0065; Rogers, Alistair/0000-0001-9262-7430; Wright, Ian J/0000-0001-8338-9143; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project [DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-SC0012704]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through it's program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe France; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1242531, 1234162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; IGBP; Global Land Project; UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through it's program QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); French Foundation for Biodiversity Research (FRB); GIS Climat, Environnement et Societe France; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Contract No. DE-SC0012704 to Brookhaven National Laboratory.

We apply these ideas to intraspecific diversity for the seagrass Zostera marina (eelgrass), by explicitly testing the influence of trait distance and genetic relatedness on the outcome of pairwise interactions among eelgrass genotypes. Increasing trait distance (but not relatedness) between eelgrass genotypes decreased the likelihood that both would persist over a year-long field experiment, contrary to our expectations based on niche partitioning. In plots in which one genotype excluded another, the biomass and growth of the remaining genotype increased with the trait distance and genetic relatedness of the initial pair, presumably due to a legacy of past interactions. Together these results suggest that sustained competition among functionally similar genotypes did not produce a clear winner, but rapid exclusion occurred among genotypes with distinct trait combinations. Borrowing from coexistence theory, we argue that fitness differences between genotypes with distinct traits overwhelmed any stabilizing effects of niche differentiation. Previously observed effects of eelgrass genetic diversity on performance may rely on nonadditive interactions among multiple genotypes or sufficient environmental heterogeneity to increase stabilizing forces and/or interactions.","[Abbott, Jessica M.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Abbott, JM (autor correspondente), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",abbott@iws.org,,,"NSF [OCE-06-23641, OCE-12-34345]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1234345] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank Brenda Cameron, Stephanie Kamel, Krista Viglienzoni, and Rick Grosberg for assistance with molecular techniques and selecting microsatellite markers for genotyping and relatedness estimates.

This is in agreement with Grime's mass-ratio hypothesis. Productivity was measured in 12 sites in a French Mediterranean post-agricultural succession, while RGR(max) was measured on 26 of the most abundant species from this successional sere, grown hydroponically. RGR(max) was only weakly correlated (r(2) = 0.12, P < 0.05) with field age when species abundance was not considered, but the two variables were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.81, P < 0.001) when the relative abundance of species in each field was taken into account. SANPP also decreased significantly with field age. This resulted in a tight relationship (r(2) = 0.77, P < 0.001) between productivity and RGR(max) weighted according to species relative biomass contribution.

We used experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with mixtures containing different numbers of species (4, 8, 16 and 60) and plant functional groups (1-4; grasses, legumes, small herbs, tall herbs) to explore patterns of variation in functional trait composition as well as climatic variables as predictors for community biomass production across several years (from 2003 to 2009). Over this time span, high community mean trait values shifted from the dominance of trait values associated with fast growth to trait values suggesting a conservation of growth-related resources and successful reproduction. Increasing between-community convergence in means of several productivity-related traits indicated that environmental filtering and exclusion of competitively weaker species played a role during community assembly. A general trend for increasing functional trait diversity within and convergence among communities suggested niche differentiation through limiting similarity in the longer term and that similar mechanisms operated in communities sown with different diversity. Community biomass production was primarily explained by a few key mean traits (tall growth, large seed mass and leaf nitrogen concentration) and to a smaller extent by functional diversity in nitrogen acquisition strategies, functional richness in multiple traits and functional evenness in light-acquisition traits. Increasing species richness, presence of an exceptionally productive legume species (Onobrychis viciifolia) and climatic variables explained an additional proportion of variation in community biomass. In general, community biomass production decreased through time, but communities with higher functional richness in multiple traits had high productivities over several years. Our results suggest that assembly processes within communities with an artificially maintained species composition maximize functional diversity through niche differentiation and exclusion of weaker competitors, thereby maintaining their potential for high productivity.

Because the rarity and unpredictability of naturally occurring climate extremes limits assessment of their ecological impacts, we experimentally imposed extreme drought and a midsummer heat wave over two years in a central U. S. grassland. While the ecosystem was resistant to heat waves, it was not resistant to extreme drought, which reduced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) below the lowest level measured in this grassland in almost 30 years. This extreme reduction in ecosystem function was a consequence of reduced productivity of both C-4 grasses and C-3 forbs. However, the dominant forb was negatively impacted by the drought more than the dominant grass, and this led to a reordering of species abundances within the plant community. Although this change in community composition persisted post-drought, ANPP recovered completely the year after drought due to rapid demographic responses by the dominant grass, compensating for loss of the dominant forb. Overall, these results show that an extreme reduction in ecosystem function attributable to climate extremes (e. g., low resistance) does not preclude rapid ecosystem recovery. Given that dominance by a few species is characteristic of most ecosystems, knowledge of the traits of these species and their responses to climate extremes will be key for predicting future ecosystem dynamics and function.","[Hoover, David L.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Hoover, DL (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, 1878 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",David.Hoover@Colostate.edu,"Knapp, Alan K/A-2931-2008","Hoover, David/0000-0002-9326-9791",Department of Energy Terrestrial Ecosystems Science Program [DE-FG02-04ER63892]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0823341] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1440484] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Department of Energy Terrestrial Ecosystems Science Program; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank P.

Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance. The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (I) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg(-1), the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures. Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies. Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

Understanding the assembly of ecological communities is central to managing such communities for conservation, restoration and invasion resistance. A central plank of modern theory is limiting similarity, i.e. a finite limit to the similarity of coexisting species. 2. Here, we test the theory of limiting similarity in a roadside plant community that has been monitored for almost 50 years. We measure differences between observed trait distributions ('functional diversity, FD') and those expected on the basis of three different null models, several trait combinations and four different methods of measuring FD. 3. The general pattern was of lower observed than expected FD, or no difference between observed and expected FD, independent of FD measure and trait set. Some rare species had 'unusual' traits; thus if the null model assumed all species had equal chance of occurring, observed FD was generally lower than expected by chance, but if the null model assumed the probability of occurrence of rare species was proportional to the observed frequency of occurrence or excluded rare species, observed FD was not significantly different from expected. 4. Synthesis. The results do not support the idea that niche differences are central to the assembly of this plant community. However, they do suggest that rare species may be functionally unusual, and that the patterns revealed by this kind of analysis can be strongly influenced by the choice of null model, and much less so by the choice of FD measure.","[Thompson, Ken; Petchey, Owen L.; Askew, Andrew P.; Beckerman, Andrew P.; Willis, Arthur J.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Dunnett, Nigel P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Landscape, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Thompson, K (autor correspondente), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",ken.thompson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Beckerman, Andrew P/D-3020-2011","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Beckerman, Andrew P/0000-0002-4797-9143",NERC [NE/D52222X/1]; Royal Society; Leverhulme Trust; British Ecological Society; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/D52222X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/D52222X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Royal Society(Royal Society of London); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); British Ecological Society; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),K.T. was supported by NERC grant NE/D52222X/1 as part of the European Science Foundation Eurocores ASSEMBLE project.

However, adaptions of phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic community structure to long-term grazing disturbance remain poorly studied, especially for ecosystems distributed in extreme environments. Methods Here, we conducted an experiment with multigrazing intensities to explore the impacts of grazing disturbance on plant phylogenetic diversity and community structure in an alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau. Important Findings Grazing disturbance enriched plant species richness (SR), and stimulated species turnover from regional species pool, consequently changing community species composition. Under low intensities, grazing exerted no obvious effects on phylogenetic diversity and community structure, whereas communities changed from overdispersion to clustering under high grazing intensity. High grazing intensity resulted in stronger environmental filtering, which consequently selected those species with high resilience to grazing disturbance. The observed clustering structure was associated with the colonizing species which were closely related to resident species, and locally extinct species, and distantly related to residents. At the plant functional trait level, high grazing intensity increased species colonization largely by altering the effect of root depth on species colonization compared to light grazing. Our results highlight that solely utilization of SR and diversity cannot fully represent grassland communities responses to grazing. The effects of species turnover on community phylogenetic diversity and structure are entailed to be explored in the future grazing studies.","[Zhu, Juntao; Zhang, Yangjian; Chen, Ning; Shen, Ruonan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Lhasa Plateau Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Juntao; Yang, Xian; Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Zhang, Yangjian] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yangjian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wenfeng] Tibet Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci, Lhasa 850032, Peoples R China; [Wang, Li] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Peking University; University Town of Shenzhen","Zhang, YJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Lhasa Plateau Ecosyst Res Stn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YJ (autor correspondente), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YJ (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",zhangyj@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Key Research & Development Program of China [2016YFC0501802, 2017YFA0604802]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571195, 41725003]; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research [2016RC102]",National Key Research & Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research(Chinese Academy of Sciences),This work was supported by National Key Research & Development Program of China (2016YFC0501802; 2017YFA0604802); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41571195; 41725003); the excellent researcher award program from Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (2016RC102).,NA,57,5,6,18,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

These characteristics are often in conflict as increasing yield through fertilization can lead to biodiversity loss. Thus, the challenge in grassland management is to sustain both yield and diversity. Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments typically reveal a positive relationship between manipulated species diversity and productivity. In contrast, observations of the effect of increasing productivity via fertilization suggest a negative association with biodiversity. Using a mathematical model simulating species co-existence along a resource gradient, we show that trade-offs and species pool structure (size and trait distribution) determines the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship. At a constant resource level, over-yielding drives a positive relationship between biodiversity and productivity. In contrast, along a resource gradient, the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship is determined by the distribution of species along trade-off axes and often resulted in a bell-shaped relationship. In accordance to this theoretical result, we then explain the general trend of plant biodiversity loss with fertilisation in the European flora, by showing empirical evidence that trait distribution of plant species pools throughout Europe is biased toward species preferring poorer soils.","[Chalmandrier, Loic; Albouy, Camille; Pellissier, Loic] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Chalmandrier, Loic; Albouy, Camille; Pellissier, Loic] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Albouy, Camille] IFREMER, Unit Ecol & Modeles Halieut, Rue Ile Yeu,BP21105, F-44311 Nantes 3, France","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Ifremer","Chalmandrier, L (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Chalmandrier, L (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",loic.chalmandrier@usys.ethz.ch,"Chalmandrier, Loïc/H-8123-2019; Pellissier, Loïc/AAG-1013-2020; Chalmandrier, Loïc/ABE-7535-2020; albouy, camille/ABD-2206-2021","Pellissier, Loïc/0000-0002-2289-8259; Chalmandrier, Loïc/0000-0002-2631-0432; albouy, camille/0000-0003-1629-2389",National Science Foundation [162604],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank Jonathan M.

LocationSemi-natural grasslands in the Rio Grande de Matagalpa watershed, Nicaragua. MethodsWe measured 14 functional response traits that are indicators of plant resource-use strategies, across 32 herbaceous and four woody species in eight permanent plots: leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf lifespan, foliar concentrations of P, N, Ca, K and Mg, plant height, lateral spread by clonal growth, root depth, start of flowering period and length of the period from flowering to seed shed. We calculated the community-weighted means (CWM) with trait values weighted by species cover for five different paddocks 11 times (between 2 Jul 2007 and 26 May 2008), and grouped them into four periods according to rainfall seasonality: early rainy season, late rainy season, early dry season and late dry season. ResultsCommunity aggregated values of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf lifespan, foliar concentrations of P, N, Ca, K and Mg, length of the period from flowering to seed shed, and to a lesser extent lateral spread by clonal growth responded to temporal variations in rainfall, and corresponded to a considerable extent to expectations based on plant resource-use strategies along resource supply gradients. Community aggregated values of specific leaf area and foliar nutrient concentration were higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, while we observed an opposite trend with leaf dry matter content and leaf lifespan. ConclusionsSemi-natural grasslands of central Nicaragua experience shifts in plant trait dominance that correspond with changes in resource supply given by rainfall seasonality, indicating that the stabilizing function of net primary productivity found in earlier studies can in part be a consequence of temporal differentiation in functional responses.","[Ospina, Sonia] Corp Colombiana Invest Agr Corpoica, Diagonal Intersecc Carrera 36A,Con Calle 23, Palmira, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Rusch, Graciela M.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, POB 5685 Sluppen, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Easdale, Tomas A.] Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Finegan, Bryan; Casanoves, Fernando; Ibrahim, Muhammad] CATIE, Cartago 30501, Turrialba, Costa Rica","Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria, AGROSAVIA; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Landcare Research - New Zealand; CATIE - Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza","Ospina, S (autor correspondente), Corp Colombiana Invest Agr Corpoica, Diagonal Intersecc Carrera 36A,Con Calle 23, Palmira, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia.",sospina@corpoica.org.co; graciela.rusch@nina.no; easdalet@landcareresearch.co.nz; bfinegan@catie.ac.cr; casanoves@catie.ac.cr; mibrahim@catie.ac.cr,"Casanoves, Fernando/I-3588-2016","Casanoves, Fernando/0000-0001-8765-9382; Easdale, Tomas A./0000-0001-5086-8527","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD); project Bio-engineering multi-functional silvopastoral landscapes: A case study in Nicaragua, Research Council of Norway [190134/V10]","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD)(CGIAR); project Bio-engineering multi-functional silvopastoral landscapes: A case study in Nicaragua, Research Council of Norway","We also thank: Evaristo Lanuza, Otilio Castro, Eddie Gonzalez, Santiago Espino, Adolfo Roque, Adolfo Zeledon, Vicente Moreno, Rosalio Bermudez, Luis Rocha and their families for allowing us to work in their farms.

We systematically investigated the LCV of 745 plant species in 9 forests, representing a range of tropical to cold-temperate forests along the 4700-km North-South Transect of Eastern China. The goals were to explore the latitudinal patterns of LCV at the levels of species, plant functional group, and community and to establish the relationship between LCV and gross primary productivity (GPP). Our results showed that LCV for all species ranged from 12.85 to 22.15 KJ g(-1) with an average of 18.46 KJ g(-1). Plant functional groups had a significant influence on LCV, with trees > shrubs > herbs, conifers > broad-leaved trees, and evergreens > deciduous trees. The different values of LCV represented the long-termevolution and adaptation of plant species to different environments. Unexpectedly, no apparent latitudinal trends of LCV at community level were observed, although LCV at the species level clearly decreased with increasing latitude. Use efficiency of LCV (CUE, gC KJ(-1)), defined as the ratio of GPP to total LCV at the community level, varied quadratic with latitude and was lower in the middle latitudes. Climate (temperature and precipitation) may explain 52.9% of the variation in spatial patterns of CUE, which was positively correlated with aridity. Our findings are the first large-scale report of the latitudinal patterns of LCV in forests at the species, plant functional group, and community levels and provide new insights into the relationship between LCV and ecosystem functions in forest communities.","[Song, Guangyan; Hou, Jihua; Li, Ying] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Hou, JH (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",houjihua@bjfu.edu.cn; henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,,"he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953","Natural Science Foundation of China [31290221, 31570471]; Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences; Natural Resources Research, CAS [2013RC102]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences; Natural Resources Research, CAS","Funding for this work was applied by Dr. N.H. from the Natural Science Foundation of China (31290221, 31570471; http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/), and the Program for Kezhen Distinguished Talents in Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS (2013RC102; http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/).

However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25-50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling.","[Teixeira, Heitor Mancini; Bianchi, Felix J.

The proportion of the developed landscape in the United States covered by turfgrass is significant and, at present, covers at least 1.9% of the total land area and comprises 60% in parts of the country. As urbanization progresses, there is a critical need to re-examine turf management practices that reduce reliance on pesticide and fertilizer inputs while contributing additional beneficial ecosystem services. In this review, we discuss the functional role of turfgrass in urban ecosystems. We identify key urban ecosystem processes associated with turfgrass and evaluate the potential to integrate biodiversity into their design and management. Specifically, we summarize research on the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function theory that shows enhanced C storage, N retention, and weed suppression in natural and managed ecosystems, which are traits that are relevant to turfgrass systems. Enhancing biodiversity in turfgrass systems could increase ecosystem services in urban landscapes and should be considered a component of sustainable management practices.","[Thompson, Grant L.; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Kao-Kniffin, J (autor correspondente), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",jtk57@cornell.edu,"Thompson, Grant/AAH-2241-2021","Thompson, Grant/0000-0002-6818-2176",National Science Foundation (NSF) [1069193]; NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems [1615560],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems,"We thank Frank Rossi, Laurie Drinkwater, and Peter Groffman for their helpful input and insight on the topic of biodiversity and ecosystem function in urban grasslands.

Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better understand effects at the community level.","[Fichtner, Andreas; Haerdtle, Werner; Li, Ying] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge; von Oheimb, Goddert] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kunz, Matthias; von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Fichtner, A (autor correspondente), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",fichtner@leuphana.de,"von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Kunz, Matthias/G-6711-2017; Fichtner, Andreas/AAP-3188-2021","von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Kunz, Matthias/0000-0002-0541-3424; Fichtner, Andreas/0000-0003-0499-4893; Hardtle, Werner/0000-0002-5599-5792","German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 891/1-3, HA 5450/1-2, BR 1698/9-3, OH 198/2-3]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the many workers and students who helped to conduct the tree inventories and to all members of the BEF China consortium that coordinated and helped with the establishment and maintenance of the experiment.

In general, disturbed, dry or nutrient-depleted soils areas tend to have lower taxonomic diversity. However, little is known about how these environmental conditions affect functional composition and intraspecific variability in tropical dry forests. We studied a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) under chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) along rainfall and soil nutrient gradients to understand how these factors influence the taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically we evaluated two aspects of CAD, wood extraction and livestock pressure (goat and cattle grazing), along soil fertility and rainfall gradients on shrub and tree traits, considering species turnover and intraspecific variability. In addition, we also tested how the traits of eight populations of the most frequent species are affected by wood extraction, livestock pressure, rainfall and soil fertility. In general, although CAD and environmental gradients affected each trait of the most widespread species differently, the most abundant species also had a greater variation of traits. Considering species turnover, wood extraction is associated with species with a smaller leaf area and lower investment in leaf mass, probably due to the indirect effects of this disturbance type on the vegetation, i.e. the removal of branches and woody debris clears the vegetation, favouring species that minimize water loss. Livestock pressure, on the other hand, affected intraspecific variation: the herbivory caused by goats and cattle promoted individuals which invest more in wood density and leaf mass. In this case, the change of functional composition observed is a direct effect of the disturbance, such as the decrease of palatable plant abundance by goat and cattle herbivory. In synthesis, CAD, rainfall and soil fertility can affect trait distribution at community and species levels, which can have significant implications for the ecosystem functioning of SDTF under increasing levels of disturbance, climate change and soil nutrient depletion.","[Sfair, Julia C.; Tabarelli, Marcelo] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Deparment Bot, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Sfair, Julia C.; de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Deparment Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Franca, Thaysa Q.] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Graduat Environm Sci, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Baldauf, Cristina] Fed Rural Univ Semiarid Reg, Dept Biosci, BR-59625900 Mossoro, RN, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido (UFERSA),"Sfair, JC (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Deparment Bot, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil.;Sfair, JC (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Deparment Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",juliacaram@gmail.com,"Tabarelli, Marcelo/F-1088-2010; Sfair, Julia Caram/C-3693-2014; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014","Tabarelli, Marcelo/0000-0001-7573-7216; Sfair, Julia Caram/0000-0003-3823-7233; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (PELD) [403770/2012-2]; Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Teconologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE APQ) [0138-2.05/14]; Capes [88881.120150/2016-01]; FACEPE (APQ) [1130-2.05/14]; Research Productivity Fellowship from CNPq [308628/2016-0]; FACEPE [BIC-2344-2.05/15],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (PELD); Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Teconologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE APQ); Capes(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FACEPE (APQ)(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE)); Research Productivity Fellowship from CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); FACEPE(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE)),"This study was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (PELD process #403770/2012-2), and Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Teconologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE APQ process #0138-2.05/14).

Recent work has shifted the focus from spatially local (alpha-diversity) to macroecological scales (beta- and gamma-diversity), emphasizing links between macroecological biodiversity and ecosystem functions (MB-EF relationships). However, before the outcomes of MB-EF analyses can be useful to real-world decisions, empirical modeling needs to be developed for natural ecosystems, incorporating a broader range of data inputs, environmental change scenarios, underlying mechanisms, and predictions. We outline the key conceptual and technical challenges currently faced in developing such models and in testing and calibrating the relationships assumed in these models using data from real ecosystems. These challenges are explored in relation to two potential MB-EF mechanisms: macroecological complementarity and spatiotemporal compensation. Several regions have been sufficiently well studied over space and time to robustly test these mechanisms by combining cutting-edge spatiotemporal methods with remotely sensed data, including plant community data sets in Australia, Europe, and North America. Assessing empirical MB-EF relationships at broad spatiotemporal scales will be crucial in ensuring these macroecological processes can be adequately considered in the management of biodiversity and ecosystem functions under global change.","[Burley, Hugh M.; Laffan, Shawn W.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Burley, Hugh M.; Mokany, Karel; Ferrier, Simon; Williams, Kristen J.; Harwood, Tom D.] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Burley, HM (autor correspondente), Univ New S Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",hugh.burley@csiro.au,"Ferrier, Simon/C-1490-2009; Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009; Laffan, Shawn W/A-3761-2008; Williams, Kristen Jennifer/B-9941-2008; Harwood, Tom D/C-7271-2009","Ferrier, Simon/0000-0001-7884-2388; Williams, Kristen Jennifer/0000-0002-7324-5880; Harwood, Tom D/0000-0002-3855-5306; Laffan, Shawn/0000-0002-5996-0570",,,,NA,86,16,16,0,56,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the contribution of individual plant species to the total biomass is much less well understood. This study addressed questions concerning community structure and responses of species -specific biomass (s-AGB) to gradients in soil acidity and fertility, topographical and climatic features, and disturbance regimes in mown and abandoned grasslands in the Sudetes Mountains (Central Europe). It identified pH as the most significant environmental gradient affecting turnover in s-AGB, and mowing cessation, tem-perature, and precipitation also had significant effects. Further, it showed high inequality in biomass among co-occurring plant species. It also showed that biomass inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) among interacting species decreases with increasing functional diversity (Rao's index). This study highlights that common plant species (in terms of frequency) play a major role in contributing to the total aboveground biomass (t-AGB). However, less frequent species are also significant contributors to the t-AGB. Thus, the combined contribution of infrequent species to the t-AGB should not be neglected. Our findings support the mass ratio hypothesis stating that ecosystem functions such as biomass production depend on dominant species. On the other hand, high niche differentiation ensures the coexistence of less competitive species with the dominants by the variety and complementarity of functional traits. Infrequent and non-dominant species were the core of the diversity seen in the studied grasslands. The maintenance of species diversity in grasslands should be prioritized in nature conservation policies to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services.","[Swacha, Grzegorz; Meserszmit, Mateusz; Kacki, Zygmunt] Univ Wroclaw, Bot Garden, Wroclaw, Poland; [Pavlu, Lenka; Pavlu, Vilem V.; Kajzrova, Klara; Titera, Jan] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Sci Humanities & Educ, Liberec, Czech Republic; [Pavlu, Lenka; Pavlu, Vilem V.; Kassahun, Teowdroes; Titera, Jan] Crop Res Inst, Grassland Res Stn Liberec, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pavlu, Vilem V.; Titera, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Radula, Malgorzata W.] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Agroecol & Plant Prod, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw; Technical University Liberec; Czech Crop Research Institute (CRI); Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences,"Swacha, G (autor correspondente), Univ Wroclaw, Bot Garden, Wroclaw, Poland.",grzegorz.swacha@uwr.edu.pl,"Meserszmit, Mateusz/HJA-5845-2022","Meserszmit, Mateusz/0000-0002-1630-9358",European Union from the European Regional Development Fund under Interreg VA Czech Republic-Poland [CZ.11.4.120/0.0/0.0/16_026/0001092],European Union from the European Regional Development Fund under Interreg VA Czech Republic-Poland,This work was funded by the European Union from the European Regional Development Fund under Interreg VA Czech Republic-Poland from the project 'Grassland biomass as a renewable energy source-Biodiversity-Biomass-Biogas' (CZ.11.4.120/0.0/0.0/16_026/0001092).

Yet, conceptual gaps constrain our ability to predict ecosystem-scale drought impacts under climate change. Here, we introduce the ecosystem wilting point (psi(EWP)), a property that integrates the drought response of an ecosystem's plant community across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Specifically, psi(EWP) defines a threshold below which the capacity of the root system to extract soil water and the ability of the leaves to maintain stomatal function are strongly diminished. We combined ecosystem flux and leaf water potential measurements to derive the psi(EWP) of a Quercus-Carya forest from an ecosystem pressure-volume (PV) curve, which is analogous to the tissue-level technique. When community predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) was above psi(EWP) (=-2.0 MPa), the forest was highly responsive to environmental dynamics. When psi(pd) fell below psi(EWP), the forest became insensitive to environmental variation and was a net source of carbon dioxide for nearly 2 months. Thus, psi(EWP) is a threshold defining marked shifts in ecosystem functional state. Though there was rainfall-induced recovery of ecosystem gas exchange following soaking rains, a legacy of structural and physiological damage inhibited canopy photosynthetic capacity. Although over 16 growing seasons, only 10% of psi(pd) observations fell below psi(EWP), the forest is commonly only 2-4 weeks of intense drought away from reaching psi(EWP), and thus highly reliant on frequent rainfall to replenish the soil water supply. We propose, based on a bottom-up analysis of root density profiles and soil moisture characteristic curves, that soil water acquisition capacity is the major determinant of psi(EWP), and species in an ecosystem require compatible leaf-level traits such as turgor loss point so that leaf wilting is coordinated with the inability to extract further water from the soil.","[Wood, Jeffrey D.

Plant productivity varies through time in response to environmental fluctuations. Reducing variability in productivity requires an improved understanding of how plant community attributes interact with environmental fluctuations to influence plant growth dynamics. We evaluated links between two community attributes, species diversity and abundance-weighted values of specific leaf area (SLA), and temporal variability in grassland productivity at patch (local) and aggregate (multi-patch) spatial scales. 2. Aggregate communities were created by combining patches of spatially distinct communities of perennial plant species from grassland biodiversity experiments in Texas, USA. Interannual variability in above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of aggregate communities was analysed as a function of two multiplicative components, mean temporal variability in the ANPP of patches and temporal synchrony in ANPP dynamics among patches. We used regression analyses to determine whether temporal variability in aggregate ANPP and its components were correlated with either species diversity or community-weighted SLA over 5 years. 3. Temporal variability in ANPP of aggregate communities was strongly correlated with temporal variability in patch ANPP. Increasing mean SLA reduced ANPP variability of aggregate communities by increasing mean productivity. Increased temporal changes in patch-scale SLA further reduced temporal variability in aggregate ANPP by reducing effects of precipitation fluctuations on productivity. Conversely, increasing species diversity over the narrow range measured increased temporal variability in aggregate ANPP.

We studied altitudinal gradients of intraspecific variations in leaf traits, productivity and resource use efficiency in the dominant species of subalpine evergreen coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved forests in Japan. We addressed three hypotheses, which are exclusive to each other. (1) Leaf traits vary along the leaf economics spectrum (LES). Plants that grow at lower and higher altitudes have fast- and slow-return strategies, respectively, which improve productivity or resource use efficiency in the respective habitat. (2) Leaf trait variations are not consistent with the LES, but they contribute to improving productivity or resource use efficiency in the respective habitat. (3) Leaf trait variations do not contribute to improving productivity or resource use efficiency at higher altitudes. On the studied mountain range, Fagus crenata, a deciduous broad-leaved tree, and Abies mariesii, an evergreen conifer, are the dominant species at lower and higher altitudes respectively. In F. crenata, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen concentrations were higher at higher altitudes. The net assimilation rate and light use efficiency during the growing season were greater at higher altitudes, which compensated for the shorter growing season in terms of annual productivity. In A. mariesii, the LMA was lower and the leaf life span was unchanged at higher altitudes. Productivity and resource use efficiency decreased with altitude. Synthesis. We conclude that F. crenata improves its productivity and resource use efficiency at higher altitudes by altering its leaf functional traits (Hypothesis 2), whereas alterations to leaf traits in A. mariesii are not associated with any improvement at higher altitudes (Hypothesis 3), which may result from the negative impact of environmental stress. Hence, the ecological significance of altitudinal variations in leaf traits depends on species and environment.","[Hikosaka, Kouki; Kurokawa, Hiroko; Arai, Takahisa; Takayanagi, Sakino; Tanaka, Hiroshi O.; Nagano, Soichiro; Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kurokawa, Hiroko; Nakashizuka, Tohru] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Arai, Takahisa] Govt Japan, Minist Environm, Kanto Reg Environm Off, Saitama, Japan; [Takayanagi, Sakino] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Trop Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Tanaka, Hiroshi O.] Kansai Univ, Dai Ichi Jr High Sch, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Nagano, Soichiro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Forest Tree Breeding Ctr, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan",Tohoku University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Jikei University; Kansai University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN),"Hikosaka, K (autor correspondente), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.",hikosaka@tohoku.ac.jp,"Hikosaka, Kouki/A-5415-2013","Hikosaka, Kouki/0000-0003-1744-3775; Kurokawa, Hiroko/0000-0001-8778-8045; Takayanagi, Sakino/0000-0003-4066-5165; Nakashizuka, Tohru/0000-0003-1419-9527","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment [D-0904]; Mitsui Co., Ltd.; Environment Fund [R11-G4-1046]; JSPS KAKENHI [25291095, 25660113, 26281049, 7H03727, 17H03835, 20H03317]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26281049, 20H03317, 17H03835, 25660113] Funding Source: KAKEN","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment; Mitsui Co., Ltd.(Mitsui & Co., LTD.); Environment Fund; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Global Environmental Research Fund of Japan's Ministry of the Environment, Grant/Award Number: D-0904; The Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

Based on a dataset from the Northeast China Transect (NECT), we attempted to test the hypothesis by comparing an objective PFT identification framework in which large datasets of plant traits were considered with two subjective PFT frameworks in which only a few plant traits were involved. Additionally, we addressed the relations between the relative abundance of PFTs and the environmental gradient represented by actual evapotranspiration (AET) along the NECT. We also discuss the changes in ecosystem functioning associated with the PFT turnover along the environmental gradient. Based on an objective PFT classification, eight PFTs were identified: deciduous trees, shrubs, perennial forbs with lower net photosynthesis, perennial forbs with higher net photosynthesis, perennial bulb-grasses, perennial tiller-grasses, annual C-4 herbs and evergreen trees. Our results indicated that some plant traits, such as life form and photosynthesis pathway, are robust surrogates for PFTs, implying that subjective approaches to PFT classification are useful. Nonetheless, caution should be used during the classification of PFTs. The framework adopted for PFT classification should depend on the specific scientific issues being dealt with. It is therefore meaningless to pursue a general framework for the identification of PFTs even within given plant communities. On the other hand, our quantitative classification of PFTs confirmed recurrent patterns with respect to PFT turnover along an environmental gradient. Furthermore, with the turnover in PFT along the NECT from the west to the cast, ecosystem properties such as productivity and carbon storage are predicted to decrease, while photosynthesis is predicted to increase, suggesting that PFT turnover would inevitably lead to changes in ecosystem functioning.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Max Planck Society","Wang, GH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, 20 Nanxincun Xiangshan, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",ghwangaq@ibcas.ac.cn,", Wang/K-4344-2019; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012","Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050",,,,NA,53,8,13,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

The temporal and spatial dynamics of soil water are closely interlinked with terrestrial ecosystems functioning. The interaction between plant community properties such as species composition and richness and soil water mirrors fundamental ecological processes determining above-ground-below-ground feedbacks. Plant-water relations and water stress have attracted considerable attention in biodiversity experiments. Yet, although soil scientific research suggests an influence of ecosystem productivity on soil hydraulic properties, temporal changes of the soil water content and soil hydraulic properties remain largely understudied in biodiversity experiments. Thus, insights on how plant diversity-productivity relationships affect soil water are lacking. 2. Here, we determine which factors related to plant community composition (species and functional group richness, presence of plant functional groups) and soil (organic carbon concentration) affect soil water in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment). 3. Both plant species richness and the presence of particular functional groups affected soil water content, while functional group richness played no role. The effect of species richness changed from positive to negative and expanded to deeper soil with time. Shortly after establishment, increased topsoil water content was related to higher leaf area index in species-rich plots, which enhanced shading. In later years, higher species richness increased topsoil organic carbon, likely improving soil aggregation. Improved aggregation, in turn, dried topsoils in species-rich plots due to faster drainage of rainwater. Functional groups affected soil water distribution, likely due to plant traits affecting root water uptake depths, shading, or water-use efficiency. For instance, topsoils in plots containing grasses were generally drier, while plots with legumes were moister. 4. Synthesis. Our decade-long experiment reveals that the maturation of grasslands changes the effects of plant richness from influencing soil water content through shading effects to altering soil physical characteristics in addition to modification of water uptake depth. Functional groups affected the soil water distribution by characteristic shifts of root water uptake depth, but did not enhance exploitation of the overall soil water storage. Our results reconcile previous seemingly contradictory results on the relation between grassland species diversity and soil moisture and highlight the role of vegetation composition for soil processes.","[Fischer, Christine; Hildebrandt, Anke] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geosci, Jena, Germany; [Fischer, Christine] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Conservat Biol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Leimer, Sophia; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Div, UFZ, Leipzig, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane; Eisenhauer, Nico; Weigelt, Alexandra; Hildebrandt, Anke] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Ravenek, Janneke; de Kroon, Hans] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Expt Plant Ecol, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Kreutziger, Yvonne] Inst Wasser & Boden Dr Uhlmann, Dresden, Germany; [Baade, Jussi] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Geog, Jena, Germany; [Bessler, Holger] Humboldt Univ, Dept Plant Nutr, Berlin, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Weigelt, Alexandra] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Leipzig, Germany; [Mommer, Liesje] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lange, Markus; Gleixner, Gerd; Hildebrandt, Anke] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Schroeder, Boris] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Landscape Ecol & Environm Syst Anal, Braunschweig, Germany; [Schroeder, Boris] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Radboud University Nijmegen; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Humboldt University of Berlin; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Wageningen University & Research; Max Planck Society; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Fischer, C (autor correspondente), Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Conservat Biol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",christine.fischer@ufz.de,"Hildebrandt, Anke/J-7062-2012; de Kroon, Hans/B-3359-2009; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Schröder, Boris/N-7250-2019; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Gleixner, Gerd/O-4215-2019; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Leimer, Sophia/AAW-8962-2021; Gleixner, Gerd/M-8519-2017; Mommer, Liesje/ABF-7005-2020; Baade, Jussi/D-4281-2013; Schroder, Boris/B-7211-2009","Hildebrandt, Anke/0000-0001-8643-1634; de Kroon, Hans/0000-0001-6151-3561; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Leimer, Sophia/0000-0001-6272-204X; Gleixner, Gerd/0000-0002-4616-0953; Mommer, Liesje/0000-0002-3775-0716; Baade, Jussi/0000-0001-9878-7232; Fischer-Bedtke, Christine/0000-0003-3855-8627; Schroder, Boris/0000-0002-8577-7980","German Science Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1451, FOR 456]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.14.006]; Max Planck Society; University of Jena",German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); University of Jena,"German Science Foundation (DFG), Grant/Award Number: FOR 1451 and FOR 456; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Grant/Award Number: Vidi Grant 864.14.006; Max Planck Society; University of Jena",NA,81,53,53,25,161,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, no consensus has been arrived at on the association between overstorey tree species diversity and the functions of understorey vegetation, such as the biomass of understorey tree, shrub, herb and bryophyte layers, despite their critical contributions to the diversity and functions of natural forests. LocationCanadian forest (42 degrees 37 to 68 degrees 14N; 53 degrees 25 to 134 degrees 46W; 4 to 2170m elevation). MethodsWe employed Canada's National Forest Inventory dataset to evaluate the influences of overstorey tree species diversity on the aboveground biomass of each forest stratum by accounting for the effects of climate, site condition and stand age. ResultsWe found that aboveground biomass of overstorey trees and total aboveground biomass were positively associated with overstorey tree species richness; however, the aboveground biomass of understorey trees, shrubs, herbs and bryophytes were not associated or were negatively associated with overstorey tree species richness, evenness and life-history trait variations. Main conclusionsOur results show positive associations between aboveground biomass of the overstorey tree layer and overstorey tree species diversity over a wide range of climate, local site conditions and stand ages in natural forests. However, contrary to previous findings that more tree species result in higher levels of multiple ecosystem functions, including understorey plant functions, our results demonstrate that the aboveground biomass of understorey vegetation has either a negligible or negative association with overstorey tree species diversity. The negative associations between overstorey tree species diversity and understorey biomass possibly resulted from greater resource filtering by overstorey trees in ecosystems with more diverse overstorey tree species.","[Zhang, Yu; Chen, Han Y.

Postcolonization sorting also affects the ultimate composition of communities assembled by people for restoration, horticulture, or conservation. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms controlling interspecific interactions in plant communities is important for explaining patterns observed in nature and predicting success or failure of utilitarian combinations. Relationships among species, especially those from studies of biological diversity and ecosystem functioning, are largely based on studies of short-lived, temperate-zone plants. Extrapolation to perennial plants in the humid tropics is risky because functional relationships among large-stature species change with time. Shifts in competitive relationships among 3 life forms-trees, palms, and perennial herbs-occurred during 13 yr in experimental tropical ecosystems. In 2 cases the novel competitive mechanism responsible for the shift was reduction in crown volume, and therefore light-capturing capability, of over-topping deciduous trees by intrusive growth from below a palm. In a third case, complementary resource use developed between 2 evergreen life forms (overstory tree and palm), probably because of differential nutrient acquisition. Species-level traits and adequate time for shifts in interspecific relationships to emerge are crucial for predicting community trajectories.","[Ewel, John J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Julia Mazzarino, Maria] Univ Nacl Comahue, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Argentina, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue,"Ewel, JJ (autor correspondente), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118526, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jackewel@ufl.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Andrew W.

Plant diversity loss can alter higher trophic-level communities via non-random species interactions, which in turn may cascade to affect key ecosystem functions. These non-random linkages might be best captured by patterns of phylogenetic diversity, which take into account co-evolutionary dependencies. However, lack of adequate phylogenetic data of higher trophic levels hampers our mechanistic understanding of biodiversity relationships in species-rich ecosystems. 2. We used DNA barcoding to generate data on the phylogenetic diversity of lepidopteran caterpillars in a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China. We analysed how different metrics of lepidopteran phylogenetic diversity (Faith's PD, MPD, MNTD) and taxonomic diversity were influenced by multiple components of tree diversity (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic). 3. Our data from six sampling periods represent 7,204 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of lepidopteran larvae, clustered into 461 molecular operational taxonomic units. Lepidopteran abundance, the effective number of species (irrespective of the focus on rare or common species) and Faith's PD and MPD (reflecting basal evolutionary splits), but not MNTD (reflecting recent evolutionary splits), significantly increased with experimentally manipulated tree species richness. Lepidopteran MNTD decreased with increasing tree MNTD. Path analyses showed that tree phylogenetic and functional diversity explained part, but not all of the effects of tree species richness on lepidopteran diversity. Importantly, tree diversity effects on lepidopteran diversity were to a large extent indirect, operating via changes in lepidopteran abundance. 4. Synthesis. Our study shows that evolutionary dependencies determine the response of herbivore communities to changes in host plant diversity. Incorporating a wider range of diversity metrics both at the level of producers and consumers can thus help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity change across trophic levels. Moreover, the dependence of trophic linkages on herbivore abundances underlines the need to address the consequences of current declines in insect abundances for ecosystem structure and functioning.","[Wang, Ming-Qiang; Li, Yi; Chesters, Douglas; Chen, Jing-Ting; Guo, Peng-Fei; Wu, Chun-Sheng; Zhou, Qing-Song; Zhu, Chao-Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ming-Qiang; Li, Yi; Chen, Jing-Ting; Zhu, Chao-Dong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ming-Qiang; Schuldt, Andreas] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Forest Nat Conservat, Gottingen, Germany; [Anttonen, Perttu; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Geobot & Bot Garden, Inst Biol, Halle, Germany; [Anttonen, Perttu; Bruelheide, Helge; Durka, Walter; von Oheimb, Goddert] Halle Jena Leipzig, German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Durka, Walter; Michalski, Stefan G.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany; [Guo, Peng-Fei] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Haerdtle, Werner] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [Ma, Keping; Zhang, Nai-Li] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmid, Bernhard] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Tharandt, Germany; [Zhu, Chao-Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Pest Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Yunnan Agricultural University; Leuphana University Luneburg; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; University of Zurich; Peking University; Technische Universitat Dresden; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Zoology, CAS","Zhu, CD (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhu, CD (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Schuldt, A (autor correspondente), Georg August Univ Goettingen, Forest Nat Conservat, Gottingen, Germany.;Zhu, CD (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Pest Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",andreas.schuldt@forst.uni-goettingen.de; zhucd@ioz.ac.cn,"Durka, Walter/E-4667-2010; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; guo, peng/AAG-4052-2019; Schuldt, Andreas/J-9429-2013; Guo, Peng/GWC-0572-2022; von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015; Chesters, Douglas/AAF-7926-2019; ZHU, Chao-Dong/E-5961-2011","Durka, Walter/0000-0002-6611-2246; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Schuldt, Andreas/0000-0002-8761-0025; von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355; ZHU, Chao-Dong/0000-0002-9347-3178; Li, Yi/0000-0002-6567-1011; Hardtle, Werner/0000-0002-5599-5792; Ma, Keping/0000-0001-9112-5340; Li, Yi/0000-0001-8878-4249; Wang, Ming-Qiang/0000-0002-3175-2200","Chinese Academy of Science [XDB310304]; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [31625024]; German Research Foundation [DFG FOR 891, 319936945/GRK2324, DFG FOR 893, DFG FOR 892]; UCAS [2017-26]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-JenaLeipzig; University of Zurich; National Science Foundation of China [31772495]",Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); UCAS; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-JenaLeipzig; University of Zurich; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Chinese Academy of Science, Grant/Award Number: XDB310304; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, Grant/Award Number: 31625024; German Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DFG FOR 891, -, 3 and 319936945/GRK2324; UCAS, Grant/Award Number: 2017-26; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-JenaLeipzig; University of Zurich; National Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31772495",NA,94,24,27,6,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, it is far from clear how the phylogenetic relatedness among species and intraspecific variation could contribute to the observed variance in plant biomass responses to climate warming. We compiled a dataset with 284 species from warming experiments to explore the relative importance of phylogenetic, intraspecific, experimental and ecological factors to warming effects on plant biomass, using phylogenetic eigenvector regression and variance decomposition. Our results showed that phylogenetic relatedness could account for about half the total variance in biomass responses to warming, which were correlated with leaf economic traits at the family level but not at species level. The intraspecific variation contributed to approximately one-third of the variance, whereas the experimental design and ecological characteristics only explained 7-17%. These results suggest that intrinsic factors (evolutionary history) play more important roles than extrinsic factors (experimental treatment and environment) in determining the responses of plant biomass to warming at the global scale. This highlights the urgent need for land surface models to include evolutionary aspects in predicting ecosystem functions under climate change.","[Shao, Junjiong; Yuan, Tengfei; Li, Zhen; Li, Nan; Liu, Huiying; Xia, Jianyang; Zhou, Xuhui] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Tiantong Natl Field Observat Stn Forest Ecosyst, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Shao, Junjiong; Liu, Huiying; Xia, Jianyang; Zhou, Xuhui] East China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Bai, Shahla Hosseini] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Sci Hlth Educ & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Lu, Meng] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Zhou, Xuhui] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, 1515 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200437, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; University of the Sunshine Coast; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,"Zhou, XH (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Tiantong Natl Field Observat Stn Forest Ecosyst, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Zhou, XH (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Ctr Global Change & Ecol Forecasting, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Zhou, XH (autor correspondente), Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, 1515 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200437, Peoples R China.",xhzhou@des.ecnu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Xuhui/H-4332-2011; Shao, Junjiong/G-1010-2016; Bai, Shahla/H-6757-2013; Zhou, Xuhui/O-5727-2019; Xia, Jianyang/S-9499-2019","Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901; Bai, Shahla/0000-0001-8646-6423; Zhou, Xuhui/0000-0002-2038-9901; Liu, Huiying/0000-0001-8903-6103; Lu, Meng/0000-0001-6923-7493","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770559, 31600387]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA06046]; Thousand Young Talents' Program in China",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Thousand Young Talents' Program in China,"The authors thank the five anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

We analyze the drivers' underlying changes in rates of key ecosystem processes (biomass productivity, litter productivity, actual litter decomposition, and potential litter decomposition) during secondary succession after shifting cultivation in wet tropical forest of Mexico. We test the importance of three alternative drivers of ecosystem processes: vegetation biomass (vegetation quantity hypothesis), community-weighted trait mean (mass ratio hypothesis), and functional diversity (niche complementarity hypothesis) using structural equation modeling. This allows us to infer the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying ecosystem process recovery. Ecosystem process rates changed during succession, and the strongest driver was aboveground biomass for each of the processes. Productivity of aboveground stem biomass and leaf litter as well as actual litter decomposition increased with initial standing vegetation biomass, whereas potential litter decomposition decreased with standing biomass. Additionally, biomass productivity was positively affected by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, and potential decomposition was positively affected by functional divergence, and negatively by community-weighted mean of leaf dry matter content. Our empirical results show that functional diversity and community-weighted means are of secondary importance for explaining changes in ecosystem process rates during tropical forest succession. Instead, simply, the amount of vegetation in a site is the major driver of changes, perhaps because there is a steep biomass buildup during succession that overrides more subtle effects of community functional properties on ecosystem processes. We recommend future studies in the field of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to separate the effects of vegetation quality (community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity) from those of vegetation quantity (biomass) on ecosystem processes and services.","[Lohbeck, Madelon; Poorter, Lourens; Bongers, Frans] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Invest Ecosistemas, Morelia 58190, Michoacan, Mexico",Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Lohbeck, M (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",madelon.lohbeck@wur.nl,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/G-8451-2019; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Martínez-Ramos, Miguel/0000-0002-7785-1917; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800","Wageningen University and Research Centre; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development) [W85-326]; NSF-LTREB [DEB-0639393, DEB 1147429]; MABOTRO projects SEMARNAT-CONACYT [2002-C01-0597]; SEP-CONACYT [CB-2005-01-51043, 2009-129740]; Nucleo DiverSus project by Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)CRN; SGP-CRA through National Science Foundation [GEO-0452325, GEO-1138881]; European Union [283093]; Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Directorate For Geosciences [1138881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1147429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Wageningen University and Research Centre; NWO-WOTRO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development); NSF-LTREB(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MABOTRO projects SEMARNAT-CONACYT; SEP-CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Nucleo DiverSus project by Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)CRN; SGP-CRA through National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Union(European Commission); Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We are grateful for the assistance and hospitality of the community of Loma Bonita, and especially we thank Gilberto Jamangape for all his help.

In this study, we measured leaf economic, hydraulic and anatomical traits of 394 tree species from tropical to cold temperate forests, from which we calculated the leaf trait moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) using community-weighted methods. Economic and hydraulic traits were decoupled at the species level, but coupled at the community level, and relationships between leaf traits in observed communities were stronger than that in null communities, suggesting that the adaptive mechanisms of plant species may be different. Furthermore, leaf economic traits were distributed more evenly across species occupying communities with lower temperature and precipitation, whereas hydraulic traits were distributed more evenly under lower water availability. This suggests that limiting similarity of specific leaf traits within communities would be enhanced when related-resources are limited, and highlights the independent assembly of leaf economics and hydraulic traits in terms of functional evenness. Importantly, the moments of leaf economic and hydraulic traits of observed communities explained more variation in ecosystem productivity than that of null communities, indicating ecosystem productivity depended on trait-based community assembly. Our results highlight the principles of community assembly regarding multi-dimensionsional traits in natural forests at a regional scale.","[Liu, Congcong; Li, Ying; Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Congcong; Zhang, Jiahui; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Forest Resources & Ecosyst Proc Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Baird, Alec S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Forestry University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Northeast Normal University - China","He, NP (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Northeast Normal Univ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun, Peoples R China.;He, NP (autor correspondente), Minist Educ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun, Peoples R China.",henp@igsrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31988102, 31870437, 31872683]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0500202]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31988102, 31870437, and 31872683) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFC0500202).",NA,54,19,19,22,77,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

However, despite the increased number of studies on biodiversity-ecosystem function, we still lack information on how stratification in tropical forests modulates biodiversity effects. Moreover, there is less investigation and argument on the role of species and functional traits in forest layers. Here, we analysed from a perspective of forest layer (sub-canopy, canopy and emergent species layers), the relationship between diversity and aboveground biomass (AGB), focusing on functional diversity and dominance, and underlying mechanisms such as niche complementarity and selection. The sub-canopy layer had the highest species richness and diversity, while the emergent layer had the highest AGB. Species richness-AGB relationship was positive for each forest layer, but stronger for sub-canopy layer than for canopy and emergent layers. Total AGB was strongly correlated with functional diversity, leaf and wood traits of species in the sub-canopy and canopy layers. This suggests that sub-canopy and canopy species are major drivers of stand diversity-AGB relationship, and that resource filtering by canopy or emergent trees may not reduce the strength of diversity-AGB relationship in the sub-canopy layer. We argue that complementary resource use by sub-canopy species that supports niche complementarity, is a key mechanism driving AGB in natural forests. Selection effects are most evident in emergent species and niche complementarity effects for sub-canopy and canopy species, supporting arguments that AGB is affected by sub-canopy species' efficient use of limited resources despite competition from emergent species.","[Mensah, Sylvanus; du Toit, Ben; Seifert, Thomas] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Mensah, Sylvanus] Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 03 BP 2819, Cotonou, Benin; [Mensah, Sylvanus] Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr, POB 16811, Kampala, Uganda",Stellenbosch University; University of Abomey Calavi,"Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.;Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Univ Abomey Calavi, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 03 BP 2819, Cotonou, Benin.;Mensah, S (autor correspondente), Reg Univ Forum Capac Bldg Agr, POB 16811, Kampala, Uganda.",sylvanus.m89@gmail.com,"Seifert, Thomas/AAF-2175-2019; Seifert, Thomas/AAW-1576-2021","Seifert, Thomas/0000-0002-9611-6272; Mensah, Sylvanus/0000-0001-6838-749X; duToit, Ben/0000-0003-0102-8550",African Forest Forum; Research Division of Stellenbosch University,African Forest Forum; Research Division of Stellenbosch University,This research was supported by the African Forest Forum through a research grant provided to the first author.

The ecological similarity of species can explain co-occurrence patterns, species interactions, and how species affect ecosystem processes. A useful approach to answer these questions is to group similar species in functional groups and then perform removal experiments. Here, we conducted a scientometric review of articles about plant functional diversity and plant functional group removal. We identified publication patterns and impact; environmental and geographic gaps; ecological effects being tested; which groups are removed; and what the removal methods are. We analyzed articles published between 1991 and 2012 in journals indexed for the Thomson ISI Web of Science database. Although the number of articles and citations of experimental articles increased during that period, the corresponding increase for functional diversity articles was 12 times greater. This might be because field and cafeteria experiments are harder to conduct. Most studies were performed in temperate regions, where taxonomic knowledge and scientific investment is greater. Studies on herbaceous vegetation predominate, probably because short-lived species are more easily removed and manipulated than are trees. The main reason for the removal experiments was to test hypotheses related to competition, and clipping at ground level was the most common removal method. Few studies were performed in the field and in greenhouses, which could control for differential responses of natural conditions and controlled environments.","[Morais, Joicy Martins] Univ Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Cianciaruso, Marcus Vinicius] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Goias; Universidade Federal de Goias,"Morais, JM (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil.",joicybio@hotmail.com,"Cianciaruso, Marcus V/B-9509-2012","Cianciaruso, Marcus V/0000-0001-5866-5345",Brazilian Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq),Brazilian Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors thank the anonymous reviewer for the comments, which helped us improve the manuscript.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that genetic diversity may influence ecosystem processes by eliciting functional plasticity among individuals encountering kin or genetically diverse neighbourhoods. We used soil conditioned by groups of closely related (siblings) and diverse genotypes of Deschampsia cespitosa - a species known to exhibit kin recognition via root exudation - to investigate the consequences of kin interactions for root litter decomposition and negative feedback between plants and soil biota. Genetically diverse groups produced root litter that had higher nitrogen (N) content, decomposed faster and resulted in greater N uptake by the next generation of seedlings compared with litter produced by sibling groups. However, a similar degree of negative soil feedback on plant productivity was observed in soil conditioned by siblings and genetically diverse groups. This suggests that characteristics of roots produced by sibling groups slow down N cycling but moderate the expected negative impact of soil pathogens in low-diversity stands. These findings highlight interactions between neighbouring genotypes as an overlooked mechanism by which genetic diversity can affect biotic soil feedback and nutrient cycling.","[Semchenko, Marina; Saar, Sirgi] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Semchenko, Marina; Saar, Sirgi; Lepik, Anu] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia",University of Manchester; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences,"Semchenko, M (autor correspondente), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.;Semchenko, M (autor correspondente), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, Lai 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia.",marina.semchenko@manchester.ac.uk,"Saar, Sirgi/AAC-1058-2022; Semchenko, Marina/AFS-2075-2022","Saar, Sirgi/0000-0002-1642-4321; ",University of Manchester; Estonian Science foundation [9332]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [IUT 20-31],"University of Manchester; Estonian Science foundation; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)","We thank John Davison, Richard Bardgett and Kristjan Zobel for providing valuable comments on the manuscript.

Accurately under-standing the relationships between land use-intensity, biodiversity, and carbon storage is important for devel-oping viable strategies to promote carbon sequestration. Here, we analyzed the effect of land-use intensity on the relationship between woody plant functional diversity and carbon storage in Prosopis woodlands of the central Monte desert of Argentina. We worked in sixteen 900 m2 square plots along disturbance gradients, eight located in highly disturbed woodlands close to livestock settlements and eight in slightly disturbed woodlands ca. 2 km away from settlements. We measured woody plant taxonomic and functional diversity and dominance metrics, and estimated carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil organic compartments. Our study shows that increasing land-use intensity erodes taxonomic and functional diversities and, ultimately, carbon storage. We found that lower carbon stocks around livestock settlements were driven by shrubs, trees, roots, litter, and dead plants, but were unaffected by the herb, woody debris, and soil compartments. Furthermore, positive relation-ships among woody species richness and functional trait diversity seem more important than the existence of few highly dominant species in determining carbon storage, providing stronger evidence for niche complementary than for mass ratio effects. We hope our study contributes to the understanding how livestock management practices influence carbon storage in Prosopis woodlands.","[Magnano, Andrea L.; Novoa, Eugenia Vazquez; Vazquez, Diego P.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, Ave Ruiz Leal S-N, Mendoza, Argentina; [Magnano, Andrea L.; Meglioli, Pablo A.; Novoa, Eugenia Vazquez; Alvarez, Juan A.; Alvarez, Leandro M.; Vazquez, Diego P.; Riveros, Cecilia C.

However, existing studies typically consider the taxonomic richness or Shannon diversity of the entire community. We know little about the connection network of taxonomic and phylogenetic facets of diversity and their collective impact on multifunctionality. In this study, the linkages of effects of diversity within functional groups were disentangled in drylands. Location The central Tibetan Plateau. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Phototrophs and diazotrophs (mainly cyanobacteria). Methods Given the carbon- and nitrogen-limited nature of drylands, we conducted a high-throughput sequencing of C/N-fixing functional groups from biocrusts and evaluated multiple facets of diversity (i.e., richness, evenness and phylogeny-related trait dissimilarity), together with seven crucial variables of soil functioning to calculate multifunctionality. The relationships between multifaceted diversity and abundance with individual functions and multifunctionality were validated by a set of solid statistical analyses. Results We found that the integrated biodiversity index was a stronger predictor of multifunctionality than richness. The divergent performance of different facets of diversity determined the idiosyncratic effect of each functional group on soil multifunctionality. Moreover, the evaluation of functional significance at the species level gave important clues on the trade-offs and redundancy in each functional group, explaining the distinct patterns of effects of diversity. Richness was the dominant factor for diazotrophs to maximize multifunctionality, whereas phylogenetic dissimilarity was the essential one for phototrophs. Main conclusions Our study demonstrated that multiple facets of diversity should be considered when assessing the effects of biodiversity. In contrast to the community level, within-functional group measures might adequately capture the features of diversity that are most correlated with soil multifunctionality. Our results provide a perspective to bridge the gap between taxonomic and trait-based approaches for elucidating the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship.","[Li, Hua; Chen, Youxin; Yu, Gongliang; Huo, Da; Li, Renhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, CAS Key Lab Algal Biol, South Donghu Rd 7, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Li, Hua] Qinghai Normal Univ, Acad Plateau Sci & Sustainabil, Xining, Peoples R China; [Chen, Youxin; Huo, Da] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rossi, Federico; De Philippis, Roberto] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Florence, Italy; [De Philippis, Roberto] CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Cheng, Xiaoli; Wang, Weibo] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, CAS Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Renhui] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Rossi, Federico] Univ Venice, Dept Enviornmental Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Mestre, Italy","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Qinghai Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Florence; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi (ISE-CNR); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS; Wenzhou University; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia","Li, RH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, CAS Key Lab Algal Biol, South Donghu Rd 7, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",reli@ihb.ac.cn,"Huo, Da/ABE-4327-2020; Yu, Gongliang/HLV-9898-2023","Huo, Da/0000-0002-3534-1644; Yu, Gongliang/0000-0002-0309-8117; Li, Hua/0000-0002-9476-0830; wang, wei bo/0000-0001-6937-9686","Special Program for Fundamental Works from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2014FY210700]; Funds for the Internationalization of the University of Florence [Azione22015]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31400368, 41877419]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA17010502]",Special Program for Fundamental Works from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Funds for the Internationalization of the University of Florence; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Special Program for Fundamental Works from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Grant/Award Number: 2014FY210700; Funds for the Internationalization of the University of Florence, Grant/Award Number: Azione22015; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31400368 and 41877419; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDA17010502",NA,73,6,6,22,131,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

We compared the taxonomic diversity (TD) and functional diversity (FD) of post-fire forest, heath, and SS alternate states to determine if community FD can explain their persistence. We hypothesized that (i) species diversity (TD and FD) would be the highest in forest followed by SS and heath due to decreased interspecific competition and niche differentiation, (ii) differences between TD and FD indices would be greater in communities with high TD in forest due to high trait differentiation and richness, and (iii) changes in community trait values would indicate niche limitations and resource availability. We conducted this study in Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada. We calculated functional dispersion (alpha FD), functional pairwise dissimilarity (beta FD), Shannon's diversity (alpha TD), and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (beta TD) from species cover. We used five functional traits (specific root length, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, height, and seed mass) related to nutrient acquisition, productivity, and growth. We found lower beta diversity in forest than heath and SS; forest also had higher species diversity and greater breadth in niche space utilization. SS was functionally similar to heath but lower than forest in functional dispersion and functional divergence. It had the highest functional richness and evenness. There was no difference in functional evenness between forest and heath. Functional beta diversity was the highest in forest, and did not differ between heath and SS. Resource acquisition and availability was the greatest in forest and the lowest in heath. We suspect that this might be due to forest having the highest functional trait turnover and niche utilization. We conclude that alternate vegetation states originating from alterations to the natural fire regime negatively impact ecosystem function.","[St. James, Colin; Mallik, Azim U.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada",Lakehead University,"Mallik, AU (autor correspondente), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",csstjam@lakeheadu.ca; amallik@lakeheadu.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) [RGPIN-2014-06239]; Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies, Lakehead University; Mitacs Global link Research Internship","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies, Lakehead University; Mitacs Global link Research Internship","This research was funded by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery grant (#RGPIN-2014-06239) awarded to Azim U.

Two broad classes of hypotheses, the mass ratio and niche complementarity effects, are proposed to explain the positive relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in multiple experimental and natural systems. Environmental variation is noted as a key regulator of forest community biomass in natural systems and the under-story tree layer is often overlooked, as the canopy tree species are more likely to contribute to total community biomass. We determined community biomass of over-story, mid-story and under-story tree layers and employed environmental factors, functional diversity metrics of leaf traits to explain the variation in community biomass in an old-growth forest. We found that topographic and edaphic factors were of vital importance in regulating the standing biomass of each tree layer. Although functional diversity displayed positive effects on standing biomass across all tree strata, the standing biomass was more affected by functional identity than diversity in over-story and mid-story tree layers. Across all strata, the most significant correlation between functional diversity and standing biomass in under-story tree layer may suggest strengthened interspecific complementary interactions. Our study confirms that environmental variation is a strong driver of forest community biomass, and the relative importance of the mass ratio and the niche complementarity hypothesis vary across tree strata in explaining diversity effects on standing biomass.

However, empirical evidence concerning the sensitivity of vertebrate community function to species loss is very limited. Here we assess documented prehistoric and historic extinctions of birds on Pacific islands in an effort to quantify the consequences of extinctions for functional structure and diversity in natural communities over broad spatial scales. Location Forty-four islands from across the Pacific. Methods We estimated functional aspects of island bird communities before and after Holocene extinctions based on body size, foraging niche, diet and activity period. We used four separate metrics to measure ecological function: functional diversity (FD), functional richness (FRic), functional evenness and functional divergence. We employed null models to separate the effects of observed extinctions from changes expected due to declining species richness. Results We find that Holocene bird extinctions led to substantial changes in community-level functional diversity. Observed declines in FD and FRic were predictable from the pre-extinction composition of communities, and did not differ from null model expectations. Across all islands, we observed non-random changes in functional trait composition, with shifts away from ground-level foraging, granivory and herbivory after extinctions. Extinctions have resulted in the loss of up to 80% of original functional diversity on some islands and caused a sharp decrease in the variety of ecological functions provided by birds. Main conclusions Our findings illustrate the significant losses of functional diversity that are already taking place on many islands and demonstrate its close connection with the loss of species. Accounting for the functional roles of species allows a more integrative understanding of ecological function and helps to bridge species and ecosystem perspectives in conservation science.","[Boyer, Alison G.; Jetz, Walter] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Boyer, Alison G.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",Yale University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Boyer, AG (autor correspondente), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",alison.boyer@utk.edu,"Jetz, Walter/ABF-1517-2020","Boyer, Alison/0000-0002-4252-9725; Jetz, Walter/0000-0002-1971-7277",Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1026764] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),,NA,66,58,59,3,162,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

We tested if biodiversity drives leaf litter production through the increase in species richness or community-weighted mean traits regardless of the influence of other biodiversity factors that reflect species niche differentiation, such as phylogenetic and functional diversities. We also tested if precipitation imposes greater influence on the production than any asynchronous effects between species that result from temporal niche partitioning. Location Seasonal heath vegetation that covers white-sand coastal areas in northeastern Brazil. Methods We conducted an observational study across 41 25-m(2)permanent plots to sample leaf litter production of the vegetation during 18 months from January 2016 to June 2017 at monthly intervals. We used structural equation modeling in combination with linear mixed models to test the above-mentioned hypotheses. Results Our study encompassed 22 focal species. Species richness was the only biodiversity factor to influence leaf litter production, although its effect was weak, suggesting that the chance of including high-yielding species by increasing richness enhances the production regardless of the degree of species niche complementarity through functional and phylogenetical dissimilarities. We also observed a major control of precipitation on leaf litter production, as well as a lack of interaction between species richness and its temporal dynamic of production, demonstrating the key role of climate-mediated controls. Conclusion We believe that plant diversity loses importance for ecosystem functioning in ecological contexts where the entire community responds similarly to abiotic pressures, particularly if the ecosystem process is marked by strong temporal dynamics. Our study provided empirical support for this line of reasoning since the seasonal heath vegetation responded mostly to rainfall seasonality.","[Silva, Jose Luiz Alves; Souza, Alexandre Fadigas; Asato, Ana Elizabeth Bonato; Silva, Gabriel Henrique Santos; de Alencar, Mery Ingrid Guimaraes; Caliman, Adriano] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Santiago, Louis Stephen] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gripp, Anderson da Rocha] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Biodiversidade & Sustentabilidade, Macae, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Souza, AF (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Natal, RN, Brazil.",alexsouza.cb.ufrn.br@gmail.com,"Souza, Alexandre/ABD-1700-2020; Caliman, Adriano/A-8668-2008; Santiago, Louis/E-3185-2016; Gripp, Anderson/AAB-8310-2019; Silva, José/AAW-1148-2021; Silva, José/ABF-2669-2020","Souza, Alexandre/0000-0001-7468-3631; Caliman, Adriano/0000-0001-9218-5601; Santiago, Louis/0000-0001-5994-6122; Gripp, Anderson/0000-0002-0099-6990; Silva, José/0000-0003-0314-7625; Alencar, Mery Ingrid Guimaraes de/0000-0002-6476-1269; Asato, Ana/0000-0002-6093-0483",Fulbright U.S. Student Program [PS00247596]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES [001]; Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte - FAPERN [005/2011],Fulbright U.S. Student Program; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte - FAPERN(Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte (FAPERN)),"Research was supported by a doctoral scholarship to JLAS from Fulbright U.S. Student Program (ID: PS00247596) and Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - CAPES (Finance Code 001).

Species' specific leaf area (SLA) is well recognised to be closely correlated with species drought resistance and with other forest functions such as productivity. Here, we used tree species abundance data from 44 501 forest plots from the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory and species SLA values from literature to assess how community weighted mean SLA (CWMSLA) and SLA diversity within communities (FDis(SLA)) of Spanish forests correlate with aridity. Later, using 19 climate change projections and following an approach that limits the values of CWMSLA along an aridity gradient, we assessed the potential climatic effects on CWMSLA for 2050 under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. Results showed that CWMSLA and FDis(SLA) decreased significantly with aridity (deviance explained was 22 and 9%, respectively) suggesting an effect of climatic filtering at community level constraining the diversity of co-occurring strategies at harsher conditions. Up to 25% of plots were predicted to suffer changes in CWMSLA with these impacts being more common and of a greater magnitude in communities characterised by a high CWMSLA and located at humid and mid-altitude zones. Instead, communities already striving in arid areas appeared to be more resilient. The study proves useful for orienting forest management practices in current permanent forest stands based on trait ecology (e.g. promoting communities species composition with specific trait values), to increase their mitigation potential and adaptive capacity to current and future changing climate conditions.","[Costa-Saura, Jose M.; Trabucco, Antonio; Spano, Donatella; Mereu, Simone] Univ Sassari, Dept Sci Nat & Environm Resources, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Trabucco, Antonio; Spano, Donatella; Mereu, Simone] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Changes, IAFES Div, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Costa-Saura, JM (autor correspondente), Univ Sassari, Dept Sci Nat & Environm Resources, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",jmcostasaura@uniss.it; antonio.trabucco@cmcc.it; spano@uniss.it; simone.mereu@cmcc.it,"mereu, simone/AAN-1877-2021; Mereu, Simone/R-8792-2017","Mereu, Simone/0000-0002-6314-3338; Trabucco, Antonio/0000-0002-0743-3680; Costa Saura, Jose Maria/0000-0001-8460-6111; Spano, Donatella/0000-0002-5661-0241",mobility programme ERASMUS +; University of Sassari,mobility programme ERASMUS +; University of Sassari,We thank MAGRAMA for free access to the Spanish Forest Inventory dataset.

However, it is not clear how multiple abiotic (i.e., climate and geography) and biological (i.e., biodiversity, functional characteristics, and stand structural complexity) factors simultaneously determine the aboveground biomass (AGB) of each individual forest stratum. We used data on 156,270 trees from 1986 plots in North China to explore the relationships among biological diversity, plant functional traits, stand structure, climate and topography on variation in AGB of each stratum. The results showed that different biological factors determined the AGB of overstory and understory, and thus indicating different underlying ecological mechanisms in temperate for-ests. The effects of forest biodiversity on AGB were only significant in understory stratum. In the overstory of the forest, forests with high tree-size dimension inequality and high dominant tree height had larger AGB, hence mass ratio effect and stand structure complexity were the main ecological mechanisms for high biomass. In understory, diversity and overstory attributes were the main factors affecting biomass. Tree height and AGB of the overstory reduced the AGB of the understory layer. In consequence overstory attributes and niche complementation were the main ecological mechanisms in the understory. The overstory exerted influence on the understory through resource quantity and resource heterogeneity. Our findings have important implications for carbon management, enhancement of forest functions and sustainable forest management in temperate forests.","[Zheng, Peiming] Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, 72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, 72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; Shandong Univ, Qingdao Forest Ecol Res Stn Natl Forestry & Grassl, 72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Zheng, PM (autor correspondente), Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, 72 Binhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.",zhengpeiming@email.sdu.edu.cn,,"Qing, Zhang/0000-0001-9351-9765","Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Resources Investigation of China [2019FY202300]; Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China [2011FY110300, 2015FY210200]",Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Resources Investigation of China; Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China,"This work was supported by the Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Resources Investigation of China (2019FY202300) and the Special Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program of China (2011FY110300, 2015FY210200) .",NA,64,0,0,15,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

We measured species and functional diversity of macrophyte community as well as environmental variables in 1,008 plots in 24 freshwater lakes across Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and Yangtze River in south China. We used generalized multilevel path models to test how the environmental effects on macrophytes productivity directly and indirectly through changes in species and functional diversity. We found distinct species and functional responses to the four groups of environmental variables:water quality, heterogeneity, climate, and topography. Macrophyte communities tended to be high richness and dominated by species with high-stem dry mass content and long flowering duration at eutrophic, heterogeneous, high altitude, or deepwater habitats. Submersed and annual species with high-specific leaf area dominated in heterogeneous and high altitude conditions, whereas species with high shoot and leaf dry mass content as well as thin stem and lamina dominated in heterogeneous and low-altitude conditions. Functional dispersion (FDis) decreased in heterogeneous and high-altitude habitats and increased at deepwater. These changes in functional composition have subsequently significant influences on community productivity, involving the opposite pathways of positive effects of community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and negative effects of FDis, ultimately contributing to the observed invariable macrophytes productivity along the tested environmental gradients. Our results provide strong evidences that both species and functional composition mediate the cascading effects of environments on macrophytes productivity.","[Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang; Ge, Dabing; Zou, Dongsheng] Hunan Agr Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dangling La, Coll Biosci Biotechnol, Ecol Dept, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hui; Yuan, Guixiang] Jiangxi Inst Water Sci, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Water Resources & Environm P, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Nanchang Inst Technol, Res Inst Ecol & Environm Sci, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenrong] Grad Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Changsha Res Stn Agr & Environm Monitoring, Key Lab Agra Ecol Proc Subtrop Reg, Chinese Acad Sci,Inst Subtrop Agr, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China","Hunan Agricultural University; Nanchang Institute Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, CAS; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Fu, H; Yuan, GX (autor correspondente), Hunan Agr Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Rural Ecosyst Hlth Dangling La, Coll Biosci Biotechnol, Ecol Dept, Changsha 410128, Hunan, Peoples R China.",huifu367@163.com; yuangx987@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China [20171BAB214006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770510, 31560145, 31760148]",Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province of China, Grant/Award Number: 20171BAB214006; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31770510, 31560145, 31760148",NA,54,4,5,6,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,DEC,2019,12,8,,,,NA,,,e2147,10.1002/eco.2147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2147,NA,OCT 2019,9,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,KA7GV,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000492139100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do functional diversity differences exist between the vegetation and seed bank and are the differences modulated by productivity and disturbance. Location: An area of diverse land use on the west coast of Scotland. Methods: Parallel vegetation and seed bank surveys were carried out across 30 sites contrasting in land use, and hence productivity and disturbance regime. Data were analysed to assess overall differences between the seed bank and vegetation in community-weighted mean for selected functional traits and to test if the difference was affected by productivity or disturbance. Three functional diversity indices were calculated for each seed bank and vegetation sample functional richness, functional divergence and functional evenness - and each index was assessed for overall differences between the seed bank, the vegetation and differences modulated by disturbance and productivity. Results: There were clear differences in many community-weighted mean traits between the seed bank and the vegetation. Plants in the vegetation were characterized by increased stature, more conservative leaf traits, wind pollination and by being perennial, whereas plants in the seed bank had higher seed longevity, higher seed masses and were more frequently insect- or self-pollinated. There was no difference in functional richness between the seed bank and the vegetation, and while both the seed bank and the vegetation functional richness were significantly lower than expected, the vegetation showed a bigger deviation from expectations compared to the seed bank. The functional diversity indices revealed different relationships between seed bank and vegetation against productivity and disturbance. Functional divergence (and its standardized effect size) indicated stronger habitat filtering for the vegetation at high levels of productivity or disturbance, while the effect size of functional richness and functional evenness suggested stronger filtering on the seed bank at high levels of productivity and disturbance. Conclusions: The significant difference in traits between the seed bank and vegetation mean that following disturbance this is likely to have a considerable impact (at least in the short term) on ecosystem function. Functional diversity patterns were less clear, with conflicting evidence on habitat filtering, depending on the metric chosen.","[Pakeman, Robin J.; Eastwood, Antonia] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",James Hutton Institute,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk; antonia.eastwood@hutton.ac.uk,"Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015","Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133",,,,NA,37,21,22,3,133,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

Here, we use a simple model of community dynamics to predict how the functional consequences of random and non-random extinction may differ. The model suggests that when resource partitioning or facilitation structures communities, the functional consequences of non-random extinction depend on the covariance between species traits and cumulative extinction risks, and the compensatory responses among survivors. Strong competition increases the difference between random and ordered extinctions, but mutualisms reduce the difference. When diversity affects function via a sampling effect, the difference between random and ordered extinction depends on the covariance between species traits and the change in the probability of being the competitive dominant caused by ordered extinction. These findings show how random assembly experiments can be combined with information about species traits to make qualitative predictions about the functional consequences of various extinction scenarios.","N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",North Carolina State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Gross, K (autor correspondente), N Carolina State Univ, Biomath Program, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",gross@stat.ncsu.edu,"Gross, Kevin/AAX-1589-2020; Cardinale, Bradley J/I-7076-2013",,,,,NA,52,73,74,1,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Using a novel approach, categorizing individual plants into functional groups according to their plant biomass production (function level) and regardless of their taxonomic attribution, we tested the pattern of SFDR (e.g., linear correlation or other type) in a semiarid, annual plant community. Species abundance and biomass were monitored over four years among neighbouring topographic sites representing a range of aridity levels in the Northern Negev, Israel. All sampled plant individuals collected at flowering season were weighted and classified into ten functional groups according to their above-ground biomass. Functional group richness and species richness were calculated for each of the 16 research plots during the four research years. We examined the relationship between species richness and functional richness and the effects of year and topographic site on species richness within each of the functional groups. Species and functional richness varied considerably among years and topographic sites. Functional richness was found to be positively related to species richness throughout the entire studied aridity range. Under relatively humid conditions, species richness was high, and increasing aridity led mainly to loss of functional redundancy. Lost taxa were typically rare, large sized or drought intolerant species with low functional plasticity. Conversely, under relatively dry conditions, species richness was low and further increasing aridity led more to loss of functional richness than to loss of species richness. Typical species that drove this pattern were abundant, medium to low sized and drought tolerant species with high functional plasticity. These species decreased their plant biomass production while guaranteeing their existence under extreme drought.","[Dovrat, Guy] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Volcani Inst, POB 1021, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Solar Energy & Environm Phys, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Phys Dept, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Moshe, Yosef; Osem, Yagil] Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Volcani Inst, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel",VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Dovrat, G (autor correspondente), Agr Res Org, Dept Nat Resources, Newe Yaar Res Ctr, Volcani Inst, POB 1021, IL-30095 Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,,"Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",Israel Science Foundation [861/09],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"We are greatly indebted to prof.

Future drought events related to climate change, however, threaten grassland functionality in many regions across the globe. The introduction of sustainable grassland management could buffer these negative effects. According to the biodiversity-productivity hypothesis, productivity positively associates with local biodiversity. The biodiversity-insurance hypothesis states that higher biodiversity enhances the temporal stability of productivity. To date, these hypotheses have mostly been tested through experimental studies under restricted environmental conditions, hereby neglecting climatic variations at a landscape-scale. Here, we provide a landscape-scale assessment of the contribution of species richness, functional composition, temperature, and precipitation on grassland productivity. We found that the variation in grassland productivity during the growing season was best explained by functional trait composition. The community mean of plant preference for nutrients explained 24.8% of the variation in productivity and the community mean of specific leaf area explained 18.6%, while species richness explained only 2.4%. Temperature and precipitation explained an additional 22.1% of the variation in productivity. Our results indicate that functional trait composition is an important predictor of landscape-scale grassland productivity.","[van't Veen, Hanneke] Univ Zurich UZH, Dept Geog, Earth Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Chalmandrier, Loic] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Sandau, Nadine] LANAT Amt Landwirtschaft & Nat, Munsingen, Switzerland; [Nobis, Michael P.; Descombes, Patrice; Psomas, Achilleas; Pellissier, Loic] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Ecol & Biodivers Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Pellissier, Loic] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Landscape Ecol, Zurich, Switzerland","University of Zurich; University of Canterbury; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Utrecht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","van't Veen, H (autor correspondente), Earth Syst Sci, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",hanneke.vantveen@geo.uzh.ch,"Chalmandrier, Loïc/ABE-7535-2020; van t Veen, Hanneke/HHN-0062-2022; Nobis, Michael P/F-6176-2010; Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Pellissier, Loic/J-2563-2015","Chalmandrier, Loïc/0000-0002-2631-0432; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Nobis, Michael/0000-0003-3285-1590; van 't Veen, Hanneke/0000-0001-7821-0655; Pellissier, Loic/0000-0002-2289-8259", [2256],,We are grateful that we could use the data from the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland (BDM) and TRY database (request no. 2256) for this project.,NA,80,4,4,13,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Despite increasing evidence for effects of biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and functional dominance), stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions (climate and topography) on tree carbon storage, the relative importance of these drivers at large scale is poorly understood. It is also still unclear whether biodiversity effects on tree carbon storage work through niche complementarity (i.e. increased tree carbon storage due to interspecific resource partitioning) or through the mass-ratio effect (tree carbon storage regulated by dominant traits within communities). Here we analyze tree carbon storage and its drivers using data of 480 plots sampled across subtropical forests in China. We use multiple regression models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions on tree carbon storage, and use a partial least squares path model to test how these variables directly and/or indirectly affect tree carbon storage. Our results show that tree carbon storage is most strongly affected by stand age, followed by climate, biodiversity and stand structural attributes. Stand age and dimate had both direct and indirect (through species diversity, functional dominance and stand structural attributes) effects. We find that tree carbon storage correlates with both species diversity and functional dominance after stand age and environmental drivers are accounted for. Our results suggest that niche complementarity and the mass-ratio effect, not necessarily mutually exclusive, both playa role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. Our results further indicate that biodiversity conservation might be an effective way for enhancing tree carbon storage in natural, species-rich forest ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As birds are indicators of environmental change and essential for the function and regeneration of forest ecosystems, this study aimed to assess the response of bird species richness and functional diversity to unregulated forest product harvesting, to illuminate the impact of harvest disturbances on forest biodiversity. Five forest ecotypes in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa were sampled by means of circular plots in which bird communities, habitat structure and harvest intensities of sub-canopy trees harvested for poles, canopy trees harvested for timber, and bark harvested for medicinal use, were recorded. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to assess the response of bird diversity to harvesting activities measured on a continuous scale, and forest ecotype. Correlations between feeding traits and environmental variables relating to habitat structure and harvest disturbances were investigated using RLQ and fourth-corner analysis to better understand which traits were sensitive to harvest disturbances. Results indicated that forest ecotype was an important driver of variation in species richness and functional diversity. Additionally, harvesting disturbances negatively affected two measures of functional diversity, while species richness and functional richness were unaffected by harvesting. Specifically, functional evenness was negatively affected by timber harvesting, while functional dispersion declined in response to pole and bark harvesting. Bird traits relating to feeding ecology (i.e. primary diet and foraging strategy) were associated with habitat structure and harvest disturbances, indicating that harvest activities affected community structure. Specifically, frugivores and granivores were negatively affected by pole and bark harvesting respectively, while omnivorous species were positively affected by these harvest activities. Conversely, timber harvesting negatively affected omnivores, and positively affected nectarivores. Bark and timber harvesting, which resulted in canopy gaps, negatively affected species which forage in the understory or on the forest floor, while pole harvesting, which reduced tree abundance but not canopy cover, negatively affected canopy-foraging species. These results suggest that current unregulated forest product harvesting in the Eastern Cape may negatively affect forest productivity and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, this is the first study to measure the effects of harvesting of poles and medicinal bark on the functional diversity of avian forest communities.","[Leaver, Jessica; Mulvaney, Jake; Cherry, Michael, I] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Smith, David A.

However, it is not known whether grazing-mediated locally colonized species correspond to N-induced locally extinct species with regard to taxonomy or traits. Data from 11 years of N addition and winter grazing experiments were analyzed to assess species richness dynamics at community and functional group levels. Regarding N treatments, enclosure and N addition were performed during the first 7 years and were then followed by winter grazing with continuous N addition during the next 4 years. Additionally, all treatments were used to compare N-induced local species extinction and grazing-mediated local species colonization. Then, traits of N-induced locally extinct species and grazing-mediated locally colonized species were further correlated with plant traits. We found that N addition induced a decline in plant species richness as a result of both random and non-random species losses. The lost species were closely associated with traits, including low height, non-clonality, low special leaf area (SLA), and low leaf N concentrations, which are relevant to light capture capacity. In contrast, grazing promoted the random colonization of local rare species, thus offsetting the N-induced decline of species richness. However, non-randomly lost species were not rescued by grazing. Grazing-mediated locally colonized species were generally characterized by high leaf carbon (C) concentrations, SLA, and seed mass. Our study provides experimental evidence indicating although grazing offsets N-induced species reduction, shifts in species composition and traits could cause a divergence in ecosystem function facing anthropogenic alterations to nutrient cycles and grazing.","[Song, Ming-Hua; Chen, Jin; Xu, Xing-Liang; OuYang, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Yuquan Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Song, Ming-Hua; Li, Yi-Kang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Area Qinghai Prov, 59 Xiguan Dajie, Xining 810008, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jun-Qin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Qinghua East Rd 35, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Forestry University","Song, MH; Xu, XL (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, A11 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Song, MH (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Area Qinghai Prov, 59 Xiguan Dajie, Xining 810008, Peoples R China.",songmh@igsnrr.ac.cn; xuxl@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Xu, Xingliang/P-9916-2015","Xu, Xingliang/0000-0003-2869-4932","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2005010401]; National key research and development program [2016YFC0502001, 2016YFC0501803]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671263]; Qinghai Innovation Platform Construction Project [2017-ZJ-Y20]",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National key research and development program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Qinghai Innovation Platform Construction Project,"The study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA2005010401), and the National key research and development program (2016YFC0502001, 2016YFC0501803), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671263), and the Qinghai Innovation Platform Construction Project (2017-ZJ-Y20).

While more negative xylem water potentials provide a larger driving force for water transport, they also cause cavitation that limits hydraulic conductivity. An optimum balance between driving force and cavitation occurs at intermediate water potentials, thus defining the maximum transpiration rate the xylem can sustain (denoted as Emax). The presence of this maximum raises the question as to whether plants regulate transpiration through stomata to function near Emax. To address this question, we calculated Emax across plant functional types and climates using a hydraulic model and a global database of plant hydraulic traits. The predicted Emax compared well with measured peak transpiration across plant sizes and growth conditions (R=0.86, P<0.001) and was relatively conserved among plant types (for a given plant size), while increasing across climates following the atmospheric evaporative demand. The fact that Emax was roughly conserved across plant types and scales with the product of xylem saturated conductivity and water potential at 50% cavitation was used here to explain the safetyefficiency trade-off in plant xylem. Stomatal conductance allows maximum transpiration rates despite partial cavitation in the xylem thereby suggesting coordination between stomatal regulation and xylem hydraulic characteristics.","[Manzoni, Stefano; Katul, Gabriel; Porporato, Amilcare] Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Manzoni, Stefano; Katul, Gabriel; Palmroth, Sari; Jackson, Robert B.; Porporato, Amilcare] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Vico, Giulia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Palmroth, Sari] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Jackson, Robert B.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Duke University,"Manzoni, S (autor correspondente), Duke Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Box 90287, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",stefano.manzoni@duke.edu,"Vico, Giulia/A-6296-2010; Katul, Gabriel G/A-7210-2008; Manzoni, Stefano/C-5330-2009","Vico, Giulia/0000-0002-7849-2653; Katul, Gabriel G/0000-0001-9768-3693; Manzoni, Stefano/0000-0002-5960-5712; Jackson, Robert/0000-0001-8846-7147","US Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Terrestrial Carbon Processes (TCP) program [DE-SC0006967]; NICCR [DE-FC02-06ER64156]; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67003-30222, 2012-68002-19795]; National Science Foundation [AGS-1102227, EAR-1013339, IOS-0920355, CBET-1033467]; NIFA [2012-68002-19795, 578306] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [0920355] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys [1033467] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1102227] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1013339] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Terrestrial Carbon Processes (TCP) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NICCR; Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Terrestrial Carbon Processes (TCP) program (DE-SC0006967) and NICCR (DE-FC02-06ER64156), the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (2011-67003-30222 and 2012-68002-19795) and the National Science Foundation (AGS-1102227, EAR-1013339, IOS-0920355, and CBET-1033467).

This need is particularly acute in tropical ecosystems, home to over 60% of global terrestrial productivity, over half of planetary biodiversity, and hotspots of anthropogenic pressure. In recent years there has been a surge of activity in collecting data on the carbon cycle, productivity, and plant functional traits of tropical ecosystems, most intensively through the Global Ecosystems Monitoring network (GEM). The GEM approach provides valuable insights by linking field-based ecosystem ecology with the needs of Earth system science. In this paper, we review and synthesize the context, history and recent scientific output from the GEM network. Key insights have emerged on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem productivity and on the role of temperature and drought stress on ecosystem function and resilience. New work across the network is now linking carbon cycling to nutrient cycling and plant functional traits, and subsequently to airborne remote sensing. We discuss some of the novel emerging patterns and practical and methodological challenges of this approach, and examine current and possible future directions, both within this network and as lessons for a more general terrestrial ecosystem observation scheme.","[Malhi, Yadvinder; Girardin, Cecile; Oliveras, Immaculada; Shenkin, Alexander; Aguirre-Gutierrez, Jesus; Dahlsj, Cecilia A.

Experiments have shown that there is a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but intense debate exists on the underlying mechanisms. While some argue that mechanisms such as niche complementarity increase ecosystem function, others argue that these relationships are a selection effect. Location Eleven tropical forests in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Methods We analysed the correlates of biodiversity and carbon storage in tropical forests using data from 59 1-ha tree plots from a standardized global tropical forest biodiversity-monitoring network. We examined taxonomic and functional diversity, aboveground C storage and environmental variables in order to determine the relationships between biodiversity and carbon storage in natural (non-plantation) tropical forests. Results We found that aboveground C storage in tropical forests increased with both taxonomic diversity and functional dominance, specifically the dominance of genera with large maximum diameters, after potential environmental drivers were accounted for (final model R-2 = 0.38, P < 0.001). Main conclusions Our results suggest that niche complementarity and the selection effect are not mutually exclusive: they both play a role in structuring tropical forests. While previous studies have documented relationships between diversity and C storage, these have largely been conducted on small scales in biomes that are relatively species poor compared with tropical forests (e.g. grasslands and temperate or boreal forests). Our results demonstrate that these positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are also present in hyperdiverse systems on spatial scales relevant to conservation and management. This insight can be used to inform the conservation and management of tropical forests, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and are some of the biologically richest ecosystems on the planet.","[Cavanaugh, Kyle C.] Smithsonian Inst, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Cavanaugh, Kyle C.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Gosnell, J.

However, biotic and abiotic factors that determine their relationships are still poorly understood, especially under future climate change scenarios. Methods Randomized block factorial experiments were performed in three meadows along an elevational gradient on Yulong Mountain, China, where open-top chambers and urea fertilizer manipulations were used to simulate warming and nitrogen addition, respectively. Besides species diversity, we measured functional diversity based on five traits: plant height, specific leaf area and leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Several abiotic factors relating to climate (air temperature and precipitation) and soil chemistry (pH, organic carbon concentration, total nitrogen concentration and phosphorus concentration) were also measured. Generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the responses of species diversity and productivity to elevation, warming, nitrogen addition and their interactions. The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the direction and magnitude of their relationship were also assessed. Important Findings Species diversity decreased with increasing elevation and declined under warming at mid-elevation, while productivity decreased with increasing elevation. Functional richness, maximum air temperature, soil pH and their interactions showed strong but negative influences on the species diversity-productivity relationship; the relationship shifted from positive to neutral and then to slightly negative as these sources of variation increased. Our study highlights the negative effects of short-term warming on species diversity and emphasizes the importance of both biotic and abiotic drivers of species diversity-productivity relationships in mountain meadow communities.","[Liu, Jia-Jia; Xu, Yong; Ge, Xue-Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yong; Shan, You-Xia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Shan, You-Xia] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resource Conservat & Sustainable Ut, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Burgess, Kevin S.] Univ Syst Georgia, Columbus State Univ, Dept Biol, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Ge, Xue-Jun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Core Bot Gardens, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Ge, XJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Resources Conservat & Sustainable U, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.;Burgess, KS (autor correspondente), Univ Syst Georgia, Columbus State Univ, Dept Biol, Columbus, GA 31907 USA.;Ge, XJ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Core Bot Gardens, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.",burgess_kevin@columbusstate.edu; xjge@scbg.ac.cn,,"Ge, Xue-Jun/0000-0002-5008-9475",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500335],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was financially supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB31000000) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500335).,NA,90,4,4,14,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4-25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Wang, Xugao; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] South China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Spatial Ecol Lab, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jucker, Tommaso] CSIRO Land & Water, 147 Underwood Ave, Floreat, Washington 6014, Australia; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol, Fis & Quim Inorgan, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, F-09200 Moulis, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; South China Normal University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Alcala; Peking University; Peking University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","Hao, ZQ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",hzq@iae.ac.cn,"Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Wang, Xugao/B-1111-2015; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Wang, Xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31730015, 31722010, 41671050]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB 31030000]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2017241]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M643117]; Fellowship Atraccion de Talento Investigador (Comunidad de Madrid) [2016-T2/AMB-1665]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fellowship Atraccion de Talento Investigador (Comunidad de Madrid)(Comunidad de Madrid); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements,"This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31730015, 31722010 and 41671050), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB 31030000) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2017241).

We aimed to explore the multivariate control over root biomass by plant diversity, together with other biotic and abiotic factors and to evaluate the relative importance of these factors. Above- and below-ground traits of 13 communities and soil properties were measured in semi-arid grasslands on the Loess Plateau, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the relative importance of the community and soil characteristics, emphasizing the direct and indirect effects of plant diversity on root biomass. Significant indirect effects of plant species richness on root biomass were found, although no direct correlation was detected between them. In the indirect pathways, plant species richness showed a positive effect on soil total nitrogen, but a significant negative influence on soil total carbon. Soil total nitrogen and plant diversity had the largest and smallest total effect respectively on root biomass in the model.

Nonetheless, it is hard to understand the biodiversity measurements, because they involve gene, phenotypic, population, species, community and ecosystem diversity. The functional diversity refers to the species richness and variety, their characteristics and how that affects the functioning of an ecosystem. Primary productivity is a key factor that affects the functioning of a forest ecosystem. Thus, the aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence of functional diversity on the woody volume productivity (as a proxy for primary production) in the Brazilian savanna. We used six functional characteristics, and to verify the relation between forest production and functional diversity facets, we tested many models. Regarding wood volume, the best models were the exponential and logarithmic. None of the linear models showed significant regression parameters as there was no additive relationship among the multifaceted aspects of functional diversity and wood volume. We found a positive correlation between the functional diversity and primary productivity, which can be used to forecast the effects of diversity variation on ecosystem services.","[de Meira Junior, Milton Serpa] Univ Brasilia, Ciencias Florestais, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Imana Encinas, Jose; Rodrigues Pinto, Jose Roberto] Univ Brasilia, Dept Engn Florestal, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lima Mota, Silvia da Luz] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Fac Engn Florestal, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso,"de Meira, MS (autor correspondente), Univ Brasilia, Ciencias Florestais, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",milton.serpa@gmail.com,"Pinto, José Roberto Rodrigues/E-3243-2019","Pinto, José Roberto Rodrigues/0000-0003-2028-6176",,,,NA,54,2,2,0,17,UNIV FEDERAL UBERLANDIA,UBERLANDIA,"AV PARA, 1720 CAMPUS UMUARAMA, UBERLANDIA, 38400-902, BRAZIL",1981-3163,,,BIOSCI J,Biosci.

To date, research has largely focused on the role of species diversity for ecosystem functioning. However, substantial intraspecific trait variation is common and a significant part of this variation caused by genetic differences among individuals. Here, we studied the relative importance of species diversity and seed family (SF) diversity within species for growth and herbivory in experimental subtropical tree assemblages. Methods In 2010, we set up a field experiment in subtropical China, using four species from the local species pool. Trees were raised from seeds, with seeds from the same mother tree forming an SF. We established 23 plots containing one or four species (species diversity treatment) and one or four SFs per species (SF diversity treatment). Tree growth (stem diameter, plant height and crown expansion) and herbivory (percentage leaf loss due to leaf chewers) were monitored annually from 2011 to 2013. Important findings Tree species richness promoted growth but had no effect on herbivory. In contrast, SF diversity reduced growth and increased herbivory but only so in species mixtures. Most of the observed effects were time dependent, with the largest effect found in 2013. Our results suggest that biodiversity can affect plant performance directly via tree species-species interactions, or context dependent, via potential effects on inter-trophic interactions. Two important conclusions should be drawn from our findings. Firstly, in future studies regarding biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships, intraspecific genetic diversity should be given similar weight as species diversity as it has often been neglected and its effects are not well understood. Secondly, we demonstrate opposite effects of biodiversity among and within species, stressing the importance to consider the effects of multiple levels of biodiversity simultaneously.","[Hahn, Christoph Z.; Michalski, Stefan G.; Shi, Miaomiao; Zeng, Xueqin; Durka, Walter] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol BZF, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Shi, Miaomiao] South China Bot Garden, 723 Xingke Rd, Guangzhou 510650, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xuefei] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Biodivers & Biogeog, 132 Lanhei Rd, Kunming 650204, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xueqin] Kadoorie Farm & Bot Garden, Lam Kam Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fischer, Markus] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Altenbergrain 21, CH-3013 Bern, Switzerland","Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Zurich; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; University of Bern","Hahn, CZ (autor correspondente), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol BZF, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",christoph.hahn@ufz.de,"Durka, Walter/E-4667-2010; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Fischer, Markus/C-6411-2008; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Yang, Xuefei/G-5656-2012; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015","Durka, Walter/0000-0002-6611-2246; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Fischer, Markus/0000-0002-5589-5900; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Yang, Xuefei/0000-0002-0986-2745; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355; Hahn, Christoph/0000-0002-8399-4682","German Science Foundation [DFG FOR 891/2, Du 404/3-2]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),German Science Foundation (DFG FOR 891/2; Du 404/3-2 to W.

Planting diversity is routinely introduced as a design element in created wetlands, yet substantive support for the finding that early diversity positively affects ecosystem functioning is lacking for wetlands. We conducted a 2-year diversity-productivity experiment using freshwater wetland mesocosms to investigate community biomass production as affected by planted macrophyte functional richness. Methods A richness gradient of macrophytes in four emergent wetland plant functional groups was established in freshwater mesocosms for two consecutive years. Species-specific aboveground morphological traits of plant size were measured at peak growth in both years; rooting depth was measured for each species in the second year. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) were harvested after peak growth in the second year; first year AGB was estimated from morphological traits in constructed regression equations. Net richness effects (i.e. both complementarity effects and selection effects) were calculated using an additive partitioning method. Important Findings Species richness had a positive effect on community AGB relative to monocultures in the first year. In the second year, mean AGB was significantly reduced by competition in the most species-rich mixtures and all mixtures underyielded relative to the average monoculture. Competition for soil resources was weaker belowground, whereby root distribution at depths > 20 cm was reduced at the highest richness levels but overall BGB production was not affected. Changes in species biomass were strongly reflected by variation in species morphological traits, and species above and belowground performances were highly correlated. The obligate annual (Eleocharis obtusa), a dominant competitor, significantly contributed to the depression of perennial species' growth in the second growing season. To foster primary productivity with macrophyte richness in early successional communities of created wetlands where ruderal strategies are favored and competition may be stronger than species complementarity, unsystematic planting designs such as clustering the same or similar species could provide protection for some individuals. Additionally, engineering design elements fostering spatial or temporal environmental variability (e. g. microtopography) in newly created wetlands helps diversify the responses of wetland macrophyte species to their environment and could allow for greater complementarity in biomass production.","[Korol, Alicia R.; Ahn, Changwoo] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 4400 Univ Dr,MS5F2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Ahn, C (autor correspondente), George Mason Univ, 4400 Univ Dr,MS5F2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",cahn@gmu.edu,,"Ahn, Changwoo/0000-0002-0747-2903",Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust Fund [222101]; Virginia Academy of Sciences small project research grant; George Mason University Patriot Green Fund,Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust Fund; Virginia Academy of Sciences small project research grant; George Mason University Patriot Green Fund,Thomas F. and Kate Miller Jeffress Memorial Trust Fund (222101); Virginia Academy of Sciences small project research grant; the George Mason University Patriot Green Fund.,NA,83,7,8,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

We explored diversity-productivity relationships at two sites of a large-scale tree diversity experiment, with harsh (Ged) and benign (Zed) environmental conditions for plantation establishment. Additive partitioning methodologies were adopted to detect phenomenological patterns in the productivity data, and the trait structure of mixed communities was used to advance insights into compositional effects. After 6years of plantation development, biomass productivity was significantly higher in mixtures compared to the monocultures of component species. We observed that processes operated through direct tree-tree interactions, as the diversity signal disappeared where trees in mixed stands were surrounded by conspecific neighbours only. This result is particularly relevant for mixed-species plantation systems, as trees are commonly planted in monospecific patches to simplify management. Partitioning unveiled strong selection effects at both plantation sites. However, at the harsh Ged-site this was caused by competitive dominance of species with fast young growth, whereas at the benign Zed-site, species with slow young growth improved their performances but not at the expense of others (i.e. trait-dependent complementarity). Species tolerance to shading is an influential trait for predicting biodiversity effects, with community-weighted means in shade tolerance mediating dominance effects (Ged) and functional diversity in shade tolerance mediating (trait-dependent) complementarity effects (Zed). Synthesis. This study highlights that biodiversity effects in young tree plantations could be explained by the functional composition of mixed communities, with a key role for species levels of shade tolerance. As contrasting results between plantation sites were observed, future research should target the context-dependency of diversity-productivity relationships.","[Van de Peer, Thomas; Muys, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium; [Van de Peer, Thomas; Verheyen, Kris; Setiawan, Nuri N.] Univ Ghent, Dept Forest & Water Management, Forest & Nat Lab, Gontrode, Belgium; [Ponette, Quentin] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",KU Leuven; Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Muys, B (autor correspondente), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Leuven, Belgium.",bart.muys@kuleuven.be,"Setiawan, Nuri/AAY-3252-2021; Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022; Muys, Bart/A-3194-2015","Ponette, Quentin/0000-0002-2726-7392; Setiawan, Nuri Nurlaila/0000-0003-3076-5824; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X",LOTUS Erasmus Mundus Action 2.

However, we know little about how the timing of arrival of functionally different species may alter structure and function during assembly. Even less is known about how plant density might interact with initial assembly. In a greenhouse experiment legumes, grasses or forbs were sown a number of weeks before the other two plant functional types were sown (PFT) in combination with a sowing density treatment. Legumes, grasses or non-legume forbs were sown first at three different density levels followed by sowing of the remaining PFTs after three or six-weeks. We found that the order of arrival of different plant functional types had a much stronger influence on aboveground productivity than sowing density or interval between the sowing events. The sowing of legumes before the other PFTs produced the highest aboveground biomass. The larger sowing interval led to higher asymmetric competition, with highest dominance of the PFT sown first. It seems that legumes were better able to get a head-start and be productive before the later groups arrived, but that their traits allowed for better subsequent establishment of non-legume PFTs. Our study indicates that the manipulation of the order of arrival can create priority effects which favour functional groups of plants differently and thus induce different assembly routes and affect community composition and functioning.","[von Gillhaussen, Philipp; Rascher, Uwe; Jablonowski, Nicolai D.; Plueckers, Christine; Temperton, Vicky M.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci Plant Sci IBG 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [von Gillhaussen, Philipp; Plueckers, Christine; Beierkuhnlein, Carl; Temperton, Vicky M.] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Biogeog, Bayreuth, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; University of Bayreuth,"von Gillhaussen, P (autor correspondente), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci Plant Sci IBG 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",p.von.gillhaussen@fz-juelich.de,"Jablonowski, Nicolai David/AAA-8672-2022; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-8797-2021; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/ABF-9693-2021; Rascher, Uwe/D-5457-2009","Jablonowski, Nicolai David/0000-0002-5298-5521; Beierkuhnlein, Carl/0000-0002-6456-4628; Rascher, Uwe/0000-0002-9993-4588; Temperton, Vicky/0000-0003-0543-4521; von Gillhaussen, Philipp/0009-0001-7466-696X",Plant Sciences (IBG-2); Forschungszentrum Julich; Tenure Track group of Vicky Temperton,Plant Sciences (IBG-2); Forschungszentrum Julich(Helmholtz Association); Tenure Track group of Vicky Temperton,"This research was funded by Plant Sciences (IBG-2) and the Forschungszentrum Julich and Philipp von Gillhaussen was funded within the Tenure Track group of Vicky Temperton.

Resilience, an ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic services to changing mowing regimes? Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park. Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness, Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models. Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P. paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows, this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves. Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely applicable to different types of restoration or management interventions, across regions and biota.","[Lochon, Iris; Colace, Marie-Pascale; Devaux, Caroline; Grigulis, Karl; Rettinger, Ricarda; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS, UMR 5553, Grenoble, France; [Lochon, Iris] UCA, INRA, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Rettinger, Ricarda] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Oberpfaffenhoffen, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; INRAE; VetAgro Sup; Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR),"Lochon, I (autor correspondente), UCA, INRA, VetAgro Sup, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France.",iris.lochon@gmail.com,,,BiodvERsA project REGARDS [ANR-12-EBID-004-01],BiodvERsA project REGARDS,"This study was funded by BiodvERsA project REGARDS, ANR-12-EBID-004-01, and contributes to the Central French Alps ILTSER/LTER-Europe Zone Atelier Alpes.

Understanding the impacts of drought on ecosystem function (i.e., resistance) and its recovery after drought (i.e., resilience) is critical for long-term sustainability of ecosystem services under climate change. We tested the effects of drought duration on ecosystem resistance by imposing four years of extreme drought (<5th percentile), and examined resilience by imposing two years of extreme drought followed by two years of recovery in a semi-arid grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. We found that the resistance of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) decreased as the drought progressed, i.e., ANPP was reduced from 33% in the first treatment year and 60% in the fourth treatment year. Resilience of the ecosystem was such that ANPP of drought plots was 83% of ambient plots one year post-drought. By the second year, ANPP of the drought plots fully recovered to ambient plot levels. Decreasing drought resistance through time was largely driven by forb re-ductions. High resilience of the system was due to grasses compensating for reductions in forb productivity. Based on these findings, we suggest that droughts may have progressively larger impacts as their duration in-creases, so single year responses may underpredict the effects of longer droughts likely to occur in the future. Additionally, longer recovery times after extreme drought events may be critical to ensure resilience and re-covery of all plant functional types. Overall, we suggest that management should strive to support and maintain the high proportion of high drought resistance and resilience plant functional types in the community may enhance the stability of biomass production in a future climate with longer and more intense extreme droughts.","[Xu, Chong; Zhang, Weiguo] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong; Ke, Yuguang; Zhou, Wei; Yu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wentao; Ma, Wang; Song, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Hoover, David L.] ARS, Rangeland Resources & Syst Res Unit, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Wilcox, Kevin R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Fu, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China","Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; University of Wyoming; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES)","Zhang, WG (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R China.;Yu, Q (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",wgzhang@lzu.edu.cn; yuqiang@caas.cn,"Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011; Wilcox, Kevin/D-7281-2013","Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623; Wilcox, Kevin/0000-0001-6829-1148; Hoover, David/0000-0002-9326-9791; Yuguang, Ke/0000-0002-1884-7627","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604802]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41320104002, 31971465]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was sponsored by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0604802) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41320104002, 31971465) .

However, previous studies produced controversial results and experimental evidence is rare. Specifically, the biological mechanisms underlying mitigation effects remain unclear, as existing work focuses on biodiversity effects related to the community scale. Using trait-based neighbourhood models, we quantified changes in above-ground wood productivity of 3,397 trees that were planted in a large-scale tree diversity experiment in subtropical China across gradients of neighbourhood diversity and climatic conditions over a 6-year period. This approach allowed us to simultaneously assess to what extent functional traits of a focal tree and biodiversity at the local neighbourhood scale mediate the growth response of individual trees to drought events. We found that neighbourhood tree species richness can mitigate for drought-induced growth decline of young trees. Overall, positive net biodiversity effects were strongest during drought and increased with increasing taxonomic diversity of neighbours. In particular, drought-sensitive species (i.e. those with a low cavitation resistance) benefitted the most from growing in diverse neighbourhoods, suggesting that soil water partitioning among local neighbours during drought particularly facilitated most vulnerable individuals. Thus, diverse neighbourhoods may enhance ecosystem resistance to drought by locally supporting drought-sensitive species in the community. Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that mechanisms operating at the local neighbourhood scale are a key component for regulating forests responses to drought and improve insights into how local species interactions vary along stress gradients in highly diverse tree communities.","[Fichtner, Andreas; Haerdtle, Werner] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [Schnabel, Florian] Univ Leipzig, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Leipzig, Germany; [Schnabel, Florian; Bruelheide, Helge; von Oheimb, Goddert] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Kunz, Matthias; von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Tharandt, Germany; [Mausolf, Katharina] Univ Kiel, Inst Ecosyst Res, Kiel, Germany; [Schuldt, Andreas] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Forest Nat Conservat, Fac Forest Sci, Gottingen, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leipzig University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Kiel; University of Gottingen,"Fichtner, A (autor correspondente), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany.",fichtner@leuphana.de,"Mausolf, Katharina/AAU-4528-2020; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Schnabel, Florian/R-8766-2019; Schuldt, Andreas/J-9429-2013; Fichtner, Andreas/AAP-3188-2021; Kunz, Matthias/G-6711-2017; von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schnabel, Florian/0000-0001-8452-4001; Schuldt, Andreas/0000-0002-8761-0025; Fichtner, Andreas/0000-0003-0499-4893; Kunz, Matthias/0000-0002-0541-3424; Hardtle, Werner/0000-0002-5599-5792; von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG FOR 891/1-3, HA 5450/1-2, BR 1698/9-3, OH 198/2-3]; Sino-German International Research Training Group TreeDi [DFG GRK 2324]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Sino-German International Research Training Group TreeDi,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: DFG FOR 891/1-3, HA 5450/1-2, BR 1698/9-3 and OH 198/2-3; Sino-German International Research Training Group TreeDi, Grant/Award Number: DFG GRK 2324",NA,77,20,21,31,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Little is known about the response of functional diversity (FD, i.e. the extent of trait differences between organisms in a given community) to increased grassland productivity following fertilization. Species diversity is often used as a surrogate for FD but evidence shows that FD is often independent from species diversity. We conducted a three-year (2004-2006) experiment in a Tibetan alpine grassland to examine the effect of fertilization on FD and SD, and its relationship with productivity. We measured specific leaf area, plant height and seed size for 32 species in control, low- and high-fertilization treatments over three years, and quantified three components of FD: functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence using Rao's index (FDrao). While SD decreased rapidly, as expected, both FRic and FDrao increased significantly with fertilization. Neither species evenness nor FEve was affected by fertilization. Aboveground biomass was not significantly correlated with SD, but it was significantly positively correlated with both FRic and FDrao, with the strongest correlations found in 2006 for FRic and in 2005 for FDrao. The results showed that FD and SD have opposite responses to short-term fertilization. The increased FD suggests enhanced niche differentiation between species remaining after fertilization, which caused species loss. This study highlights the importance of examining FD in assessing fertilization-induced biodiversity loss and its impacts on ecosystem functioning in grasslands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

According to the mass ratio hypothesis, the loss of a dominant plant species, which has a larger proportionate contribution to productivity, is expected to exert an overwhelming effect on this important ecosystem function. However, via competitive release, loss of a dominant species can provide the opportunity for other plant species to establish, thrive and become abundant in the community, potentially compensating for the function lost. Furthermore, if resource limitation is removed, then the compensatory response of function to the loss of a dominant species should be greater and more rapid than if resources are more limiting. To evaluate how resources may limit compensation of above-ground productivity to the loss of a dominant plant species, we experimentally removed the C-4 perennial tallgrass, Andropogon gerardii, from intact plant communities. We added water for 4 years, as well as nitrogen in the fourth year, to test the effect of resource limitation on the compensatory response. Overall, above-ground biomass production increased in the remaining community with both water and nitrogen addition. However, this increase in biomass production was not sufficient to fully compensate for the loss of A. gerardii, indicating water and nitrogen were not limiting short-term compensation in this community. Following the removal of the dominant species, there was reordering of species abundances in the community, rather than changes in species richness. The C-4 grass Bouteloua curtipendula was the most responsive species, increasing by 57.9% in abundance with water addition and 91.0% with both water and nitrogen addition. Despite this dramatic increase in abundance, its short stature and lower per capita biomass production prevented this species from compensating for the loss of A. gerardii. Synthesis. Short-term compensation after the loss of a dominant plant species can be hastened by increased resource availability, but ultimately full compensation appears to be limited by the presence and abundance of species in the remaining community that possess traits that allow them compensate for the species lost.","[Chaves, Francis A.; Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chaves, Francis A.; Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University,"Chaves, FA; Smith, MD (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Chaves, FA; Smith, MD (autor correspondente), Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",fachaves@alumni.colostate.edu; Melinda.smith@colostate.edu,,"Smith, Melinda/0000-0003-4920-6985; Chaves Rodriguez, Francis Andrea/0000-0002-0013-6755",Nature Conservancy; National Science Foundation [DEB-1440484],Nature Conservancy; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Nature Conservancy; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1440484",NA,127,5,5,8,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Short-term changes were assessed during three consecutive years in plots previously exposed to different grazing pressures and compared to plots in long-term (30-40 years) exclosures. Short-term cessation of grazing led in the short-term to an increase in relative biomass of annual crucifers and tall annual and perennial grasses, while biomass of annual legumes, annual thistles and short annual grasses decreased. Consequently, similarity increased between vegetation recently excluded from grazing and vegetation in long-term protected plots. Our research showed that in systems with high dominance of grasses and annual species, the rapid changes in plant species composition that occur after grazing cessation were associated with a fast recovery of the potential for biomass production to levels found in long-term protected plots, while litter decomposition rate did not change even after long-term cessation of grazing. Moreover, previous history of grazing did not affect plant litter decomposition, despite higher litter quality in grazed treatments. This study provides new insights about the processes involved in the diverse responses of ecosystem functions resulting from shifts in species composition associated with grazing cessation and land use change in Mediterranean grasslands.","[Golodets, Carly; Kigel, Jaime] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Sternberg, Marcelo] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Tel Aviv University,"Golodets, C (autor correspondente), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",adonis@agri.huji.ac.il,"Sternberg, Marcelo/AFQ-1615-2022","Sternberg, Marcelo/0000-0001-8710-4141; Golodets, Carly/0000-0001-6509-9716",European Union [EVK2-2002-00356],European Union(European Commission),"This research was carried out as part of the European Union funded project VISTA ( Vulnerability of Ecosystem Services to Land Use Change in Traditional Agricultural Landscapes), EVK2-2002-00356.

Simultaneously, changes in plant communities can influence fungal pathogen communities. Exactly which host plant attributes determine the composition of fungal pathogen communities on the leaves remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized foliar fungal pathogen communities in subtropical tree communities along an experimental diversity gradient in Jiangxi, South-East China. On 32 tree species, we identified all visible fungal structures and symptoms microscopically and studied fungi-specific traits such as conidia or spores in detail. We asked how different facets of biodiversity, including taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional tree diversity, shape fungal diversity and fungal infestation at different scales. We found a positive relationship between tree richness and fungal richness at the plot level. At the level of individual trees of the same species, the relationship between tree species richness and fungal species richness was marginally significantly negative. Importantly, the fungal infestation rates decreased as tree species richness increased, suggesting that colonization of hosts by specialist fungi was impeded by dilution of the pool of available hosts. Moreover, we found evidence for similar topologies between phylogenetic topologies of trees and fungal genera which is a precondition for coevolution and we identified leaf traits, including leaf habit (deciduous/evergreen), leaf magnesium content and stomata size that predicted fungal richness and infestation. Synthesis. Our study indicates that host tree species harbour different foliar fungal pathogens, which sums up to the highest fungal pathogen richness in more diverse forest stands. At the same time, the foliar fungal pathogen infestation rate for each tree species decreased with increasing tree richness in forests. We identified leaf traits that can help to better predict fungal pathogen richness and infestation, and we show that phylogenetically closely related tree species harbour phylogenetically closely related foliar fungal pathogens. These new insights might be helpful to improve the pest resilience of future forests and plantations.","[Rutten, Gemma; Hoenig, Lydia; Schwass, Rowena; Braun, Uwe; Saadani, Mariem; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Rutten, Gemma; Hoenig, Lydia; Schwass, Rowena; Braun, Uwe; Saadani, Mariem; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Rutten, Gemma; Saadani, Mariem; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Schuldt, Andreas] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Forest Nat Conservat, Gottingen, Germany; [Michalski, Stefan G.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Gottingen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Rutten, G (autor correspondente), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Halle, Saale, Germany.;Rutten, G (autor correspondente), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany.;Rutten, G (autor correspondente), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany.",ggpmrutten@gmail.com,"Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Schuldt, Andreas/J-9429-2013","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schuldt, Andreas/0000-0002-8761-0025; Rutten, Gemma/0000-0001-9552-4605; Saadani, Mariem/0000-0002-9276-2568",German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research [DFG FZT 118]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 891/3],German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, Grant/Award Number: DFG FZT 118; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FOR 891/3",NA,82,10,10,10,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Although there is increasing evidence that species and functional diversity, stand structural diversity, functional compositions, and elevation play roles in ecosystem functioning, the relative strengths of these drivers and the underlying mechanisms (mass-ratio hypothesis or niche complementarity hypothesis) are not clear. Aboveground carbon storage, species diversity, stand structural diversity, community-weighted mean (CWM), and functional diversity (FDvar) of 12 leaf traits were analyzed using data from 56 old-growth forest communities in the Dawei Mountain area of Southwest China. Multiple regression models were used to test the relative importance of the predictor variables and the structural equation model was used to explore the direct and indirect influences on aboveground carbon storage. High structural diversity moderately enhanced aboveground carbon storage. CWM leaf nitrogen concentration in young leaves weakly affected aboveground carbon storage. Our final multiple regression model showed that aboveground carbon storage is mostly affected by diameter at breast height (DBH) diversity, followed by FDvar of dry matter concentration in mature leaves and CWM nitrogen concentration in young leaves. The structural equation model indicated that elevation negatively affects aboveground carbon storage via diameter at breast height (DBH) diversity. Our results suggest that niche complementarity effects moderately drive aboveground carbon storage in tropical old-growth forests, but do not fully support the importance of the mass-ratio hypothesis.","[Wang, Genzhu; Wu, Xiuqin; Hussain, Azfar; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jianshui Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Genzhu; Wu, Xiuqin; Hussain, Azfar; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry Adm Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yuguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Pang, Danbo] Ningxia Univ, Breeding Base State Key Lab Land Degradat & Ecol, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Institute of Desertification Studies, CAF; Ningxia University","Zhou, JX (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jianshui Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Zhou, JX (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry Adm Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wanggenzhu410@bjfu.edu.cn; liuyuguo@caf.ac.cn; wuxq@bjfu.edu.cn; pang8902@nxu.edu.cn; xiaoyang_jason@msn.cn; azfarhussayn@gmail.com; zjx001@bjfu.edu.cn,"Hussain, Azfar/L-6952-2015; Jinxing, Zhou/I-6015-2017","Jinxing, Zhou/0000-0003-2182-9849; Hussain, Azfar/0000-0001-7160-4002; Liu, Yuguo/0000-0002-7140-0189; Pang, Danbo/0000-0003-3017-5218","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870707, 41671080]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0502504]; Beijing Municipal Education Commission; Innovative Transdisciplinary Program Ecological Restoration Engineering",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Beijing Municipal Education Commission(Beijing Municipal Commission of Education); Innovative Transdisciplinary Program Ecological Restoration Engineering,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870707, 41671080) and the National Key R&D Program of China (2016YFC0502504).

Promoting a more diverse mammalian herbivore community, including large and megaherbivores, may result in positive cascade effects for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, reintroducing an ecologically functional substitute of an extinct large herbivore could mitigate current biodiversity declines and foster semi-natural grassland conservation. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year rewilding experiment where 12 feral horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). We used community-weighted mean plant functional traits to elucidate plant community changes induced by grazing through time. We also investigated the effects of this experimental treatment on insect pollinated plants and on pollinator habitat use. The grassland community exerted a mixed tolerance/avoidance response to grazing. This resulted in plant functional compositional changes which favoured prostrate plant species with higher specific leaf area, characteristic of ruderal communities. Plant species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed areas. Butterfly and bumblebee habitat use, as well as feeding and resting activities were also higher in grazed areas. Moreover, the number of pollinators increased with plant species richness.Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of a given herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild horses can have significant effects on the functional composition of grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use. Novel management alternatives are urgently needed to reverse the negative effect of land abandonment in European agricultural landscapes. Thus, rewilding interventions with large mammalian herbivores may offset current biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems.

Experiments often revealed an increase of productivity in species-rich ecosystems. But large variations in these relationships, both on a local scale and in comparisons of sites along environmental gradients, still challenge our understanding of the role of species (with specific traits) and their interactions in ecosystems. In this study, we explored the role of species traits for ecosystem functioning. We used an individual-based mechanistic grassland model which captures intra- and interspecific competition between plants for light and soil resources. We explored how the dynamics and productivity of grasslands are influenced by species traits and analyzed in a simulation study two species, which differ only in one particular trait. Our focus was on traits that determine how species can cope with resource limitations, for which we identified their relative importance for (1) individual plant growth, (2) monoculture dynamics, and (3) species mixture dynamics. We observed diverse relationships between species traits and different vegetation attributes for the different ecosystem levels. Most traits showed positive but saturating trends of increasing trait values but the variability in these relations increased in monocultures with intraspecific plant interactions and even more pronounced in mixtures with interspecific interactions. Using a process-based grassland model, we were able to simulate overyielding even though it was not correlated with trait values or trait differences between both species. Correlations were also not found in terms of stability of vegetation dynamics. In contrast, for some traits already small differences supported the dominance of a species in the mixture in which species dynamics generally followed trade-offs. The here presented simulation study demonstrates the use of process-based models for analyzing trait-productivity relationships in grasslands. Such models can complement previous approaches in empirical and theoretical biodiversity research and can help to move closer to understanding the mechanisms governing grassland dynamics.","[Taubert, Franziska; Hetzer, Jessica; Schmid, Julia S.; Huth, Andreas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Huth, Andreas] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Huth, Andreas] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Environm Syst Res, Barbarastr 12, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University Osnabruck,"Taubert, F (autor correspondente), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",franziska.taubert@ufz.de,,"Taubert, Franziska/0000-0001-7594-8152; Schmid, Julia/0000-0003-2378-8980; Hetzer, Jessica/0000-0002-2384-0024",Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2818301116]; Projekt DEAL,Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); Projekt DEAL,"FT, JSS, and AH are supported (were supported) by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE) under the innovation support program (Grant No. 2818301116).

Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.","[Berdugo, Miguel;

However, empirical tests of complementarity in natural forests are rare. We conducted a spatially explicit analysis of 518433 growth records for 274 species from a 50-ha tropical forest plot to test neighborhood complementarity, the idea that a tree grows faster when it is surrounded by more dissimilar neighbors. We found evidence for complementarity: focal tree growth rates increased by 39.8% and 34.2% with a doubling of neighborhood multi-trait dissimilarity and phylogenetic dissimilarity, respectively. Dissimilarity from neighbors in maximum height had the most important effect on tree growth among the six traits examined, and indeed, its effect trended much larger than that of the multi-trait dissimilarity index. Neighborhood complementarity effects were strongest for light-demanding species, and decreased in importance with increasing shade tolerance of the focal individuals. Simulations demonstrated that the observed neighborhood complementarities were sufficient to produce positive stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships. We conclude that neighborhood complementarity is important for productivity in this tropical forest, and that scaling down to individual-level processes can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stand-level biodiversity-productivity relationships.","[Chen, Yuxin; Wang, Yongfan; Yu, Shixiao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Ecol, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wright, S.

Sixteen PFTs were distinguished based on the following traits: (1) life-span (annual vs. perennial); (2) photosynthetic pathway (C-3 vs. C-4); (3) reproductive mode (clonal vs. non-clonal); and (4) growth form (grass vs. forb). Analysis of data indicates that density, coverage, number of species, phytomass, and relative importance of PFTs depended strongly on life-span, photosynthetic pathway, reproductive mode and growth form. Phytomass was significantly correlated with PFT diversity, but not species diversity. However, the relationship between phytomass and PFT diversity varied greatly with year, with a positive relationship in 2001 and 2004 and a negative one in 2002 and 2003. As the restoration proceeds, the perennial C-3 clonal grass became the greatest contributor to PFT diversity.

We added both N (10gm(-2)) and three levels of P (2.5, 5 and 10gm(-2)) to a native, ungrazed tallgrass prairie burned biennially in northeastern Kansas, USA, to determine the independent and interactive effects of N and P on plant community composition and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP). After a decade of nutrient additions, we found few effects of P alone on plant community composition, N alone had stronger effects, and N and P additions combined resulted in much larger effects than either alone. The changes in the plant community were driven by decreased abundance of C-4 grasses, perhaps in response to altered interactions with mycorrhizal fungi, concurrent with increased abundance of non-N-fixing perennial and annual forbs. Surprisingly, this large shift in plant community composition had little effect on plant community richness, evenness and diversity. The shift in plant composition with N and P combined had large but variable effects on ANPP over time. Initially, N and N and P combined increased above-ground productivity of C-4 grasses, but after 4years, productivity returned to ambient levels as grasses declined in abundance and the community shifted to dominance by non-N-fixing and annual forbs. Once these forbs increased in abundance and became dominant, ANPP was more variable, with pulses in forb production only in years when the site was burned.Synthesis. We found that a decade of N and P additions interacted to drive changes in plant community composition, which had large effects on ecosystem productivity but minimal effects on plant community diversity. The large shift in species composition increased variability in ANPP over time as a consequence of the effects of burning. Thus, increased inputs of N and P to terrestrial ecosystems have the potential to alter stability of ecosystem function over time, particularly within the context of natural disturbance regimes.","[Avolio, Meghan L.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Koerner, Sally E.; Wilcox, Kevin R.; Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Koerner, Sally E.; Wilcox, Kevin R.; Smith, Melinda D.] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [La Pierre, Kimberly J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Wilson, Gail W.

We used data from three published experiments and a field survey of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a habitat-forming marine angiosperm, to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between genetic relatedness and plant biomass. The genetic relatedness of an assemblage strongly predicted its biomass, more so than the number of genotypes. However, contrary to the pattern observed in multispecies assemblages, maximum biomass occurred in assemblages of more closely related individuals. The mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear; however, our data support a role for both trait differentiation and cooperation among kin.

The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait variability (ITV), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores the effects of ITV on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects on shifts in community -wide traits, we highlight the role of ITV in community functional response to grazing and its implications for ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows. 2. We measured three chemical traits (LC: leaf carbon, LN: leaf nitrogen and LP: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content) that are critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means (CWM) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance of ITV vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient availability. 3. The CWM for foliar nutrients and SLA(CWM) increased in response to grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores, especially LPCWM enrichment and loss of available soil P. The LPCWM was strongly negatively correlated with LDMCCWM, which was significantly higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to grazing were generally best captured by ITV and not changes in species occurrence and abundance, although ITV was consistently correlated with species turnover for all traits. 4. Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus. We discuss the implications of these results for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem function and rangeland sustainability in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, especially with regard to managing grazing rotation to strike a balance between favouring secondary productivity of domesticated stock vs. small herbivorous mammals","[Niu, Kechang] Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Niu, Kechang; Lechowicz, Martin J.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada",Nanjing University; Peking University; McGill University,"Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Nanjing Univ, Dept Biol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (autor correspondente), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",kechangniu@nju.edu.cn,"Niu, Kechang/F-7648-2014; Lechowicz, Martin/Y-7211-2019; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009","Niu, Kechang/0000-0003-4845-2930; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Lechowicz, Martin/0000-0003-2562-7136",National Science Foundation of China [31370008]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB956304],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"We thank Professor Shucun Sun, Philippe Choler, Marc Cadotte, Lara Souza and two anonymous referees for valuable discussion and constructive comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

The latter of these effects may be especially important among early-successional species in disturbed ecosystems, but experimental tests are few. We removed two groups of early-successional species, an annual forb Gutierrezia dracunculoides (DC.) S. F. Blake and annual species (mostly grasses) that complete growth early in the growing season [early-season (ES) species], from a heavily-grazed grassland in central Texas, USA dominated by a C-4 perennial grass. We sought to determine effects of annuals on grassland functioning [productivity, water balance, soil and plant nitrogen (N)] and composition. Removals did not impact N retention in the soil/plant system during the two years of this study, but removing ES annuals increased the amount of water between 30 and 120 cm in the soil profile early in each growing season. Production and N accumulation by vegetation declined following the removal of ES annuals in approximate proportion to the contribution of annuals to aboveground biomass and N, consistent with the mass-ratio hypothesis. By the second year, production and N uptake by initially sub-dominant species increased to fully compensate for the loss of annuals. These results are consistent with the view that ecosystem functions are more strongly linked to species attributes than to diversity per se. Longer-term effects of annuals on grassland composition were evident in a dramatic increase in biomass of perennial forbs after annuals were removed. Because perennial forbs differ from the dominant grass in this grassland in traits that influence ecosystem functioning, ES annuals may affect grassland functioning more by regulating the composition of vegetation than by directly affecting process rates.","USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA; Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; USDA ARS, High Plains Grasslands Res Stn, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; Texas Agr Exptl Stn, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, Temple, TX 76502 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Iowa State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research,"Polley, HW (autor correspondente), USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, 808 E Blackland Rd, Temple, TX 76502 USA.",wpolley@spa.ars.usda.gov,,"Derner, Justin/0000-0001-8076-0736; Wilsey, Brian J./0000-0002-0628-5006",,,,NA,29,28,33,3,40,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2006,113,2,,,,NA,287,295,,,,NA,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,044EO,NA,Green Submitted,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000237655400010,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,sim,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a lack of understanding of how drought affects the trade-off of above- and belowground biomass in desert steppe. We conducted a four-year (2015-2018) drought experiment to examine the responses of community above-and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB) to manipulated drought and natural drought in the early period of growing season (from March to June) in a desert steppe. We compared the associations of drought with species diversity (species richness and density), community-weighted means (CWM) of five traits, and soil factors (soil Water, soil carbon content, and soil nitrogen content) for grass communities. Meanwhile, we used the structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate whether drought affects AGB and BGB by altering species diversity, functional traits, or soil factors. Results We found that manipulated drought affected soil water content, but not on soil carbon and nitrogen content. Experimental drought reduced the species richness, and species modified the CWM of traits to cope with a natural drought of an early time in the growing season. We also found that the experimental and natural drought decreased AGB, while natural drought increased BGB. AGB was positively correlated with species richness, density, CWM of plant height, and soil water. BGB was negatively correlated with CWM of plant height, CWM of leaf dry matter content, and soil nitrogen content, while was positively correlated with CWM of specific leaf area, CWM of leaf nitrogen content, soil water, and soil carbon content. The SEM results indicated that the experimental and natural drought indirectly decreased AGB by reducing species richness and plant height, while natural drought and soil nitrogen content directly affected BGB. Conclusions These results suggest that species richness and functional traits can modulate the effects of drought on AGB, however natural drought and soil nitrogen determine BGB. Our findings demonstrate that the long-term observation and experiment are necessary to understand the underlying mechanism of the allocation and trade-off of community above-and belowground biomass.","[Li, Xiangyun; Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Hu, Ya; Guo, Xinxin; Guo, Aixia] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangyun; Hu, Ya; Guo, Xinxin; Guo, Aixia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xiaoan; Zhao, Xueyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Naiman Desertificat Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangyun; Zuo, Xiaoan; Yue, Ping; Zhao, Xueyong; Hu, Ya; Guo, Xinxin; Guo, Aixia] Key Lab Stress Physiol & Ecol Cold & Arid Reg, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong; Yu, Qiang] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Natl Hulunber Grassland Ecosyst Observat & Res St, Beijing 10008, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Cold & Arid Regions Environmental & Engineering Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS","Zuo, XA (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",zuoxa@lzb.ac.cn,"?, ?/GWC-4881-2022; Yu, Qiang/E-2097-2011","Yu, Qiang/0000-0002-5480-0623","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071140, 41622103]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program [2019QZKK0305]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [1100000036]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS,"This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (42071140 and 41622103), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program (2019QZKK0305) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (1100000036).

We tested the relationship between aboveground biomass (AGB) and various aspects of functional diversity (functional richness (FRic), functional evenness (FEve) and functional divergence (FDiv)), functional beta diversity and functional composition. Our study areas were located in four different bioclimatic regions including desert-steppe, steppe, semi-steppe, and Mediterranean rangelands extending along a productivity gradient created by the elevational-rainfall variations in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran. The results showed that FDiv positively predicted AGB in more productive (i.e., Mediterranean) and negatively in less productive rangelands of desert-steppe, steppe and semi-steppe. Functional beta diversity predicted AGB only in more productive regions in semi-steppe and Mediterranean rangelands. Functional beta diversity decomposed into turnover and nestedness, with turnover being more important in more productive and nestedness being more important in less productive ecosystems. The results also showed that the effects of FD and functional beta diversity on AGB are generally directed by animal grazing through homogenizing community-wide trait composition in less productive ecosystems and inducing shifting mosaics across locations in more productive ecosystem. The results indicate that different components of FD were significantly related to AGB and the strength and direction of these effects vary with the different components studied and the bioclimatic regions under the study. In higher productive ecosystems, both functional diversity and functional beta diversity are likely to contribute more to AGB through the complementary use of the resources. In less productive ecosystems, however, the functional identity of dominant species and traits would drive AGB. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

We examined the responses of two dominant species of Inner Mongolia grassland to altered seasonal precipitation regimes by a manipulated rainout shelter experiment. With the increase of precipitation amount, the perennial rhizomatous grass Leymus chinensis increased below-ground biomass while the perennial bunchgrass Stipa grandis increased above-ground biomass. With the increase of the interval between rainfall events, biomass production of L chinensis reduced significantly while S. grandis was not affected. Soil moisture and inorganic nitrogen are two dominant environmental factors affecting plant responses in biomass production. Plant functional traits, such as leaf area, leaf number, leaf photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency, also played important roles in affecting species responses to altered precipitation regimes. Our results clearly showed that two species differed significantly in their responses to altered intra-seasonal precipitation regimes, suggesting that the structure and functioning of grassland ecosystem may be significantly altered by specific species responses to future climate change.

This study provides a strong support to the mass ratio effect in addition to the niche differentiation and facilitation effects. & Context The underlying mechanisms for the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function remain hotly debated for the last four decades. Aims We tested how do biodiversity, functional trait composition, stand structural attributes, and topographic variables explain aboveground C storage under different disturbance regimes. Methods We used linear mixed effects and structural equation models to simultaneously evaluate the effects of biodiversity, stand structure attributes, functional trait composition, and topographic variables on aboveground C storage while considering for the effects of disturbance intensity. We used biophysical data from 260 plots within 11 permanent temperate mixed forests in Northeastern China. Results Aboveground C storage was driven by stand basal area, individual tree size inequality, community-weighted mean of maximum height and wood density, and diversity (functional evenness and mean nearest taxon distance). The structural equation model showed that aboveground C storage was positively affected by individual tree size inequality and trait composition (i.e., CWM of maximum height), after accounting for the strongest negative direct and indirect effects of disturbance intensity. Conclusion Conserving functional identity of species and maintaining complex stand structure would be the alternative choices for higher aboveground C storage in temperate mixed forests.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Wang, Xugao; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Dept Ecol, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] Peking Univ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] South China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Spatial Ecol Lab, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gazol, Antonio] IPE CSIC, Inst Pirenaico Ecol, Ave Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50010, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Alcala, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Dept Ciencias Vida, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Alcala De Henares 28805, Madrid, Spain; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, F-09200 Moulis, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Peking University; Peking University; South China Normal University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE); Universidad de Alcala; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","Wang, XG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",wangxg@iae.ac.cn,"Wang, Xugao/B-1111-2015; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012","Wang, Xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852; Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671050 31722010, 31730015]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-DQC002]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2017241]; CFERN Award Fund on excellent academic achievement; BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Fund on excellent academic achievement; Guangdong Provincial Government [205588]; Talento Fellowship [2016-T2/AMB-1665]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; CFERN Award Fund on excellent academic achievement; BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Fund on excellent academic achievement; Guangdong Provincial Government; Talento Fellowship; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0500300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41671050 31722010 and 31730015), (the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB-SSW-DQC002)) and Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (2017241).

We studied whether weeds could be suppressed sustainably by use of functionally diverse grassland mixtures with high resource capture and biomass yield. To this aim, growth of planted phytometers and of spontaneously establishing, unsown species were evaluated. To represent weeds, seedlings of five model species were grown up as phytometer plants in stands of forage leys under two precipitation regimes. Ley stands comprised monocultures and mixtures of two and four species with distinctly differing plant functional traits (PFTs) related to nitrogen (N) acquisition and rooting depth, including: Lolium perenne L. (PFT: non-N-2-fixing, shallow-rooted), Cichorium intybus L. (non-N-2-fixing, deep-rooted), Trifolium repens L. (N-2-fixing, shallow-rooted), and Trifolium pratense L. (N2 fixing, deep-rooted). Five PFTs were measured from these ley species: leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, leaf N and carbon (C) content, and the leaf C:N ratio. Survival of phytometer plants and biomass of unsown species was measured under rainfed conditions and during an experimentally induced, nine week summer drought with complete rain exclusion. Mixtures with high functional dispersion (calculated from PFTs) and biomass yield suppressed phytometer plants and unsown species significantly more than mixtures with low functional dispersion. Under rainfed conditions, fourteen weeks after planting, survival of phytometer plants was 32% in the four-species mixture with the highest functional dispersion, while survival was 68% averaged across monocultures, the stands with the lowest functional dispersion. Surviving individuals had significantly smaller tiller number and rosette diameter in mixtures than in monocultures. Biomass of unsown species was 3.6 kg ha(-1) in the four-species mixture, but was 13.0 kg ha(-1) in averaged monocultures. The suppressive effect was equally apparent under drought conditions, where, at the end of the drought period, phytometer survival was 16% and 47% in the four-species mixture and averaged monocultures, respectively. During a six-week post-drought period, the suppressive effect of ley mixtures on phytometer plants was sustained. The strong suppressive effect of ley mixtures was explained by their superior capture for light and plant-available soil N. We conclude that cropping functionally diverse grassland mixtures could be a sustainable strategy to enhance weed suppression under rainfed and drought conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying successful invasions is an important component of conservation and management efforts, but this has been poorly investigated in a spatially explicit manner. Knowing where and why invasion patterns change throughout the landscape enables managers to use context-specific controls on the spread of invasive species. Using high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy, we studied plant performance in growth within and across landscapes to examine the dominance and spatial distribution of an invasive tree, Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), in heterogeneous environmental conditions of a submontane Hawaiian tropical forest. We assessed invader performance using the GPP ratio index, which is the relative difference in remotely sensed estimates of gross primary productivity between canopies of guava and canopies of the invaded plant community. In addition, we used airborne LiDAR data to evaluate the impacts of guava invasion on the forest aboveground carbon density in different environments. Structural equation modeling revealed that substrate type and elevation above sea level interact and amplify landscape-scale differences in productivity between the invasive species and the host plant community (GPP ratio); differences that ultimately control levels of dominance of guava. We found shifts in patterns of forest carbon storage based on both gradual increase of invader dominance and changes in environmental conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the remotely sensed index defined as the GPP ratio provided an innovative spatially explicit approach to track and predict the success of invasive plants based in their canopy productivity, particularly within a landscape-scale framework of varying environmental factors such as soils and elevation. This approach may help managers accurately predict where invaders of forests, scrublands, or grasslands are likely to exhibit high levels of dominance before the environment is fully invaded.","[Barbosa, Jomar M.; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hughes, R.

So far, however, it still remains unclear how competitive interactions respond to N and water additions, which will be important to understand how plant community composition changes. To test plant competition ability in different successional stages under N and water addition treatments, a pot experiment under field conditions was performed. Six dominant plant species, three early-successional species, Artemisia lavandulaefolia, Artemisia capillaris, and Pennisetum centrasiaticum versus three late-successional species, Stipa krylovii, Leymus chinensis, and Artemisia frigida, were grown in monocultures and in two-species mixtures under factorial combinations of N and water addition treatments. We found that (1) there were interactive effects of N addition, water addition and interspecific competition on plant biomass; (2) For a given species, competitive abilities were correlated with biomass difference of neighboring species; (3) N and water additions interactively increased competition intensity and shifted species competitive hierarchies; (4) Late-successional species had stronger competitive abilities in the N addition treatment, whereas early-successional species had stronger competitive abilities after water addition or N + water addition. Our results show that N and water additions increased the intensity and impact of interspecific competition on plant growth, which has great implications for community structures. Since interspecific differences in competitive abilities were not well explained by species biomass, species identity, such as plant functional traits, should be included to predict the impact of increased N and water availability on plant communities and ecosystem functions.","[Jiang, Lili] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Lan, Zhichun] Nanchang Univ, Inst Life Sci, Ctr Watershed Ecol, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guifeng] Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Coll Agr, Tongliao 028000, Peoples R China; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Nanchang University; Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Jiang, LL (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lljiang@itpcas.ac.cn; lanzihichun@ibcas.ac.cn; paul.kardol@slu.se,"Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015","Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301600, 31260108]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2012BAC19B04]; State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China [2013CB956002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China(National Basic Research Program of ChinaState Key Development Program for Basic Research of China)",This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41301600; 31260108); supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2012BAC19B04) and supported by State Key Development Program of (for) Basic Research of China (2013CB956002).,NA,37,1,1,6,62,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

Flooding threatens the functioning of managed grasslands by decreasing primary productivity and increasing nitrogen losses, notably as the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Sowing species with traits that promote flood resilience and mitigate flood-induced N2O emissions within these grasslands could safeguard their productivity while mitigating nitrogen losses. 2. We tested how plant traits and resource acquisition strategies could predict flood resilience and N2O emissions of 12 common grassland species (eight grasses and four legumes) grown in field soil in monocultures in a 14-week greenhouse experiment. 3. We found that grasses were more resistant to flooding while legumes recovered better. Resource-conservative grass species had higher resistance while resource-acquisitive grasses species recovered better. Resilient grass and legume species lowered cumulative N2O emissions. Grasses with lower inherent leaf and root delta C-13 (and legumes with lower root delta C-13) lowered cumulative N2O emissions during and after the flood. 4. Our results highlight the differing responses of grasses with contrasting resource acquisition strategies, and of legumes to flooding. Combining grasses and legumes based on their traits and resource acquisition strategies could increase the flood resilience of managed grasslands, and their capability to mitigate flood-induced N2O emissions.

However, there is little consensus about which modes of functional biodiversity are most important for tree growth at large spatial scales. Here we assessed the relative importance of climate, functional diversity and functional identity (i.e. the community mean values of four key functional traits) for tree growth across the European continent, spanning the northern boreal to the southern Mediterranean forests. LocationFinland, Germany, Sweden, Spain and Wallonia (Belgium). MethodsUsing data from five European national forest inventories we applied a hierarchical linear model to estimate the sensitivity of tree growth to changes in climate, functional diversity and functional identity along a latitudinal gradient. ResultsFunctional diversity was weakly related to tree growth in the temperate and boreal regions and more strongly in the Mediterranean region. In the temperate region, where climate was the most important predictor, functional diversity and identity had a similar importance for tree growth. Functional identity was strongest at the latitudinal extremes of the continent, largely driven by strong changes in the importance of maximum height along the latitudinal gradient. Main conclusionsFunctional diversity is an important driver of tree growth in the Mediterranean region, providing evidence that niche complementarity may be more important for tree growth in water-limited forests. The strong influence of functional identity at the latitudinal extremes indicates the importance of a particular trait composition for tree growth in harsh climates. Furthermore, we speculate that this functional identity signal may reflect a trait-based differentiation of successional stages rather than abiotic filtering due to water or energy limitation.","[Ratcliffe, Sophia; Liebergesell, Mario; Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Madrigal Gonzalez, Jaime; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Madrid 28871, Spain; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Castaneda, Jose M.

Growing evidence has revealed that ecosystem productivity depends more on the functional characteristics of species than on their number. However, exactly to what extent tree diversity effects on ecosystem productivity are influenced by the variability and composition of functional traits have rarely been tested both across and at given species richness (SR) levels. Here, we employed a meta-analysis of global-scale data from 59 tree diversity experiments to examine how the diversity and community-weighted means (CWMs) of economics traits determine the outcomes of tree mixture effects on productivity across and within SR levels. We found that the positive effects of tree mixtures on productivity were strengthened by the increasing multidimensional functional dispersion (FDis) and the CWM of leaf nitrogen content both across and within two- and four-species mixtures. Moreover, the multidimensional FDis and the CWM of leaf nitrogen content increased the complementarity effect rather than the selection effect. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that both diversity in the leaf economics spectrum and trait concentration on the 'fast' end of the spectrum strengthen biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. This study provides mechanistic insights into the potent roles of plant economics traits, especially leaf nitrogen content, in determining the magnitude (and even directionality) of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in forest ecosystems.","[Zheng, Li-Ting; Biswas, Shekhar R.; Bao, Di-Feng; Fang, Xiao-Chen; Abdullah, Muhammad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestor, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci,Forest Ecosyst Res & Obse, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li-Ting; Biswas, Shekhar R.; Bao, Di-Feng; Fang, Xiao-Chen; Abdullah, Muhammad; Yan, En-Rong] Inst Ecochongming IEC, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

Community assembly theory has also helped to reveal the causes of biodiversity organization. However, the causes and consequences of biodiversity have been discussed in parallel and simultaneous consideration of both has been limited, even though they are both influenced by regional environmental conditions. To understand the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, I focused on the linkages between the number of tree species and biomass productivity across forest biomes under a range of bioclimatic conditions. I found that high tree diversity generally increased productivity. This was primarily due to a selection process that results from a high probability of having high-performance species and their dominance at high diversity, regardless of the biome. In less-productive biomes, the residual importance of diversity, which likely reflects other forms of biological interactions (including species complementarity), increased productivity. These findings of differential diversity effects under different environmental conditions are consistent with the existing theory of community assembly, which predicts a shift in the assembly process from stochasticity to determinism with increasing environmental harshness. Analyses based on functional trait diversity also supported this theory: stochastic assembly (resulting in the selection effect) and deterministic assembly (possibly resulting from interspecific niche differences) became more important in productive and less-productive biomes, respectively.Synthesis. Increasing our understanding of the causalities between diversity and other characteristics, such as productivity, is crucial, particularly for forest ecosystems, because of the increasing interest in productivity-related ecosystem services supported by diverse assemblages of trees.","[Mori, Akira S.] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Mori, AS (autor correspondente), Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",akira.s.mori@gmail.com,"Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013","Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198","Ministry of the Environment, Japan","Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","Ministry of the Environment, Japan",NA,77,44,45,4,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments address ecosystem-level consequences of species loss by comparing communities of high species richness with communities from which species have been gradually eliminated. BEF experiments originally started with microcosms in the laboratory and with grassland ecosystems. A new frontier in experimental BEF research is manipulating tree diversity in forest ecosystems, compelling researchers to think big and comprehensively. 2. We present and discuss some of the major issues to be considered in the design of BEF experiments with trees and illustrate these with a new forest biodiversity experiment established in subtropical China (Xingangshan, Jiangxi Province) in 2009/2010. Using a pool of 40 tree species, extinction scenarios were simulated with tree richness levels of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 species on a total of 566 plots of 25.8x25.8m each. 3. The goal of this experiment is to estimate effects of tree and shrub species richness on carbon storage and soil erosion; therefore, the experiment was established on sloped terrain. The following important design choices were made: (i) establishing many small rather than fewer larger plots, (ii) using high planting density and random mixing of species rather than lower planting density and patchwise mixing of species, (iii) establishing a map of the initial ecoscape' to characterize site heterogeneity before the onset of biodiversity effects and (iv) manipulating tree species richness not only in random but also in trait-oriented extinction scenarios. 4. Data management and analysis are particularly challenging in BEF experiments with their hierarchical designs nesting individuals within-species populations within plots within-species compositions. Statistical analysis best proceeds by partitioning these random terms into fixed-term contrasts, for example, species composition into contrasts for species richness and the presence of particular functional groups, which can then be tested against the remaining random variation among compositions. 5. We conclude that forest BEF experiments provide exciting and timely research options. They especially require careful thinking to allow multiple disciplines to measure and analyse data jointly and effectively. Achieving specific research goals and synergy with previous experiments involves trade-offs between different designs and requires manifold design decisions.","[Bruelheide, Helge; Both, Sabine; Erfmeier, Alexandra; Seidler, Gunnar; Trogisch, Stefan; Welk, Erik] Univ Halle Wittenberg, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge; Buscot, Francois; Durka, Walter; Erfmeier, Alexandra; Trogisch, Stefan; Welk, Erik; Wirth, Christian; Wubet, Tesfaye] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Nadrowski, Karin; Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Assmann, Thorsten; Haerdtle, Werner; Klein, Alexandra-Maria; Schuldt, Andreas; von Oheimb, Goddert] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, D-21332 Luneburg, Germany; [Bauhus, Juergen; Klein, Alexandra-Maria; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Buscot, Francois; Durka, Walter; Gutknecht, Jessica L.

Intraspecific phenotypic variability could stem both from underlying genetic diversity and from plasticity in response to environmental cues. The latter might derive from modifications to a plant's epigenome and potentially last multiple generations in response to previous environmental conditions. We experimentally disentangled the role of genetic diversity and diversity of parental environments on population productivity, resistance against environmental fluctuations and intraspecific phenotypic variation. Methods A glasshouse experiment was conducted in which different types of Arabidopsis thaliana populations were established: one population type with differing levels of genetic diversity and another type, genetically identical, but with varying diversity levels of the parental environments (parents grown in the same or different environments). The latter population type was further combined, or not, with experimental demethylation to reduce the potential epigenetic diversity produced by the diversity of parental environments. Furthermore, all populations were each grown under different environmental conditions (control, fertilization and waterlogging). Mortality, productivity and trait variability were measured in each population. Key Results Parental environments triggered phenotypic modifications in the offspring, which translated into more functionally diverse populations when offspring from parents grown under different conditions were brought together in mixtures. In general, neither the increase in genetic diversity nor the increase in diversity of parental environments had a remarkable effect on productivity or resistance to environmental fluctuations. However, when the epigenetic variation was reduced via demethylation, mixtures were less productive than monocultures (i.e. negative net diversity effect), caused by the reduction of phenotypic differences between different parental origins. Conclusions A diversity of environmental parental origins within a population could ameliorate the negative effect of competition between coexisting individuals by increasing intraspecific phenotypic variation. A diversity of parental environments could thus have comparable effects to genetic diversity. Disentangling the effect of genetic diversity and that of parental environments appears to be an important step in understanding the effect of intraspecific trait variability on coexistence and ecosystem functioning.","[Puy, Javier; Dvorakova, Hana] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Na Zlate Stoce 1, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Puy, Javier; Latzel, Vit] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Carmona, Carlos P.] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Bot, Lai St 40, EE-51005 Tartu, Estonia; [de Bello, Francesco] CIDE CSIC, C Naquera Km 4-5, Valencia 46113, Spain",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE),"Puy, J (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Na Zlate Stoce 1, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.;Puy, J (autor correspondente), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",puy.javi@gmail.com,"de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; Puy, Javier/ABH-8775-2020","Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Puy, Javier/0000-0002-6422-2791",Czech Science Foundation [GACR 20-00871S]; Estonian Research Council [PSG293]; European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange),Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange),This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR 20-00871S) and the Estonian Research Council (project PSG293 to C.P.C.) and the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (Centre of Excellence EcolChange to C.P.C.).,NA,60,12,13,5,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Current vegetation models typically regulate the plant photosynthetic response to soil moisture stress through an empirical function, rather than a mechanistic response where plant water potentials respond to changes in soil water. This representation of soil moisture stress may introduce significant uncertainty into projections for the terrestrial carbon cycle. We examined the use of the soil moisture limitation function in historical and future emissions scenarios in nine Earth system models. We found that soil moisture-limited productivity across models represented a large and uncertain component of the simulated carbon cycle, comparable to 3-286% of current global productivity. Approximately 40-80% of the intermodel variability was due to the functional form of the limitation equation alone. Our results highlight the importance of implementing mechanistic water limitation schemes in models and illuminate several avenues for improving projections of the land carbon sink. Plain Language Summary Understanding the environmental controls of terrestrial ecosystem productivity is of critical importance because terrestrial ecosystems directly impact the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, model projections disagree on the future sign and magnitude of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 drawdown, so it is uncertain if terrestrial ecosystems will continue to mitigate climate change in the future. Here we show that the current representation of water-limited productivity across state-of-the-art vegetation models is a large and uncertain component of terrestrial productivity, comparable in magnitude to current global productivity. Our results provide a foundation for improved projections of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, ranging from vegetation growth to agricultural productivity.","[Trugman, A.

The vast majority of empirical research in this context is based on relatively small-scaled experiments, where plant species composition is manipulated and ecosystem functions, such as biomass production, are monitored through time. Results of these studies have generally shown that ecosystem functioning is more stable in more species-diverse communities. Yet, there is very little evidence so far that these relations also hold in naturally assembled plant communities. In this study, we combined historical vegetation and climate data with time series of remotely sensed indicators of aboveground biomass production (MODIS NDVI), to quantify how plant species diversity and plant functional diversity correlate with the temporal stability of biomass production in naturally assembled Dutch dune grasslands under the influence of fluctuating drought. We found that the negative NDVI response to drought of grasslands with a higher plant species richness and diversity was significantly lower than the response of less species rich and species-diverse grasslands, indicating a stabilizing role of plant species richness and diversity on biomass production through time. We found no relation between plant functional diversity and NDVI response to drought. This is the first study to generalize experimentally established relations between species diversity and stability of ecosystem functioning to naturally assembled grasslands across a large spatial and temporal scale.","[van Rooijen, Nils M.; Honnay, Olivier] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Plant Conservat & Populat Biol, Dept Biol, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [de Keersmaecker, Wanda; Coppin, Pol] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Biosyst, BIORES M3, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Ozinga, Wim A.; Hennekens, Stephan M.; Schaminee, Joop H.

Yet, it remains unclear how multiple abiotic (i.e., soil nutrients) and biotic (i.e., biodiversity, functional identity and stand structural complexity) factors simultaneously determine aboveground biomass in each individual forest stratum and whole-community. To address this knowledge gap, we disentangled the relative effects of soil nutrients (soil fertility hypothesis), taxonomic, functional trait and evolutionary diversity (niche complementarity hypothesis), stand structural complexity (niche differentiation hypothesis based on tree sizes), and community-weighted mean trait values (mass ratio hypothesis) on aboveground biomass across forest strata and whole-community. We used forest inventory, functional traits and environmental factors datasets from 125 subtropical forest plots in Eastern China. Multiple linear regression models were performed for the selection of best predictors within each biotic group, and structural equation modelling was used to evaluating how multiple abiotic and biotic drivers determine aboveground biomass. In the overstorey, aboveground biomass was positively related to the community-weighted mean of tree height (i.e., functional dominance) and stand density but was negatively related to functional evenness on nutrient-rich soils. In the understorey, aboveground biomass was positively related to phylogenetic species richness and stand-level tree mean diameter (i.e., a proxy for forest growth) but was negatively related to Shannon's species diversity on nutrient-poor soils. Understorey aboveground biomass was also determined by overstorey stand structure and functional dominance through direct and indirect effects via understorey biotic drivers. These results suggest that functional dominance and stand structural complexity are the main biotic drivers of overstorey aboveground biomass. Whereas, functional dominance and stand structural complexity of overstorey, soil nutrients, and niche complementarity among understorey species with the conservative strategy determine understorey aboveground biomass. Whole-community aboveground biomass might be resulting from the superior role of overstorey functional dominance. This study highlights that the niche complementarity, mass ratio and soil nutrients effects are important for driving aboveground biomass, but in different ways across overstorey and understorey strata in natural subtropical forests. We argue that the relative effect of biodiversity loss on aboveground biomass depends critically on the functional and evolutionary identity of the lost species in the specific forest stratum. Better insights can be gained into forest management and biodiversity conservation by considering overstorey and understorey strata separately in complex natural forests.","[Ali, Arshad; You, Wen-Hui; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; You, Wen-Hui; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecoeestorat, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] South China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Spatial Ecol Lab, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Han Y.

Edge effects are among the most significant consequences of forest fragmentation. Therefore, understanding the impacts of edge creation on biodiversity is crucial for forest management and biological conservation. 2. In this study, we used trait-based and phylogenetic approaches to examine the effects of fragmentation on components of diversity and above-ground biomass of rainforest tree communities in Madagascar in forest edge vs. interior habitats. 3. Tree communities in forest edges showed lower phylogenetic diversity relative to those in interior habitats, suggesting that some clades may be more vulnerable to environmental filtering than others. Functional diversity was also significantly lower on the edge for productivity traits, but not for dispersal traits. Tree communities in the forest edge showed higher divergence of dispersal traits and lower divergence in productivity traits than expected, while functional diversity in interior forest did not differ from random expectations. This suggests that separate mechanisms affect productivity traits vs. dispersal traits in edge habitats. 4. There was no significant difference in above-ground biomass between edge and interior habitats, suggesting that edge effects have not yet negatively influenced the forest's potential for carbon storage. However, these changes may not have occurred yet, given the slow turnover of tree communities. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the role of edge effects in the erosion of functional and phylogenetic diversity of highly diverse tree communities. While above-ground biomass did not appear to be affected by forest edge in our study, we suggest long-term monitoring of forests for potential changes in ecosystem functioning. These findings also indicate the need to reduce edge creation and buffer existing edges for holistic biodiversity conservation.","[Razafindratsima, Onja H.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brown, Kerry A.; Carvalho, Fabio] Kingston Univ, Dept Geog & Geol, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England; [Johnson, Steig E.] Univ Calgary, Dept Anthropol & Archaeol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Johnson, Steig E.; Wright, Patricia C.; Dunham, Amy E.] Ctr ValBio, Ifanadiana Fianarantsoa, Madagascar; [Wright, Patricia C.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dunham, Amy E.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX USA",Harvard University; Kingston University; University of Calgary; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; Rice University,"Razafindratsima, OH (autor correspondente), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",onja@ricealumni.net,"Dunham, Amy E./B-6161-2009; Razafindratsima, Onja Harinala/I-7533-2019; Brown, Kerry/U-5082-2019; Carvalho, Fabio/AAB-5806-2020","Dunham, Amy E./0000-0002-5184-3652; Razafindratsima, Onja Harinala/0000-0003-1655-6647; Carvalho, Fabio/0000-0002-6305-5602; BROWN, KERRY/0000-0002-6342-8966; Johnson, Steig/0000-0003-2257-8949","David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Rufford Foundation [5748-2]; Primate Conservation, Inc.; Rice University","David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Rufford Foundation; Primate Conservation, Inc.; Rice University","David and Lucile Packard Foundation; Rufford Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 5748-2; Primate Conservation, Inc.; Rice University (Centennial Award to Support Undergraduate Research)",NA,76,14,15,6,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

These debates have identified important issues about species traits, functional groups, and community assembly, but a broader debate needs to include discussions about the scale (grain and extent) of experiments relative to natural spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In addition, alternative statistical analyses need to be explored that focus on comparison among several statistical models rather than simple hypothesis testing. Analyses of the first 2 years of data from a new biodiversity field experiment are used to illustrate these concepts. A traditional one-way ANOVA demonstrates the expected increase in aboveground biomass with higher levels of vascular plant diversity. Further analysis demonstrates that this relationship is absent when the community contains either Arrhenatherum elatius or Holcus lanatus, two dominant species of grass. Variance in biomass is also a function of diversity and both spatial and temporal heterogeneity are significant factors in the analysis despite precautions taken to minimize them. These examples illustrate the degree to which the analysis of a field experiment influences the interpretation of the observed results. Ultimately, results from field experiments must be validated through continued comparisons among field experiments, mathematical models, laboratory trials, and mesocosm experiments.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Deutschman, DH (autor correspondente), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",ddeutschman@sciences.sdsu.edu,"Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012",,,,,NA,45,11,11,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Our results showed that latitudinal variation in species-level SDL and SLL was minimal, but community-level SDC and SLC decreased clearly with increasing latitude. The relationship between SD and SL was negative across species and different plant functional types (PFTs), but positive at the community level. Furthermore, community-level SDC correlated positively with forest NPP, and explained 51% of the variation in NPP. These findings indicate that the trade-off by regulating SDL and SLL may be an important strategy for plant individuals to adapt to environmental changes, and temperature acts as the main factor influencing community-level stomatal traits through alteration of species composition.

Extensive research has shown that a decrease in species diversity and an increase in productivity are a common phenomenon following fertilization in grasslands ecosystem. The magnitude of the response of species diversity and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to fertilization mainly depends on species traits (mean trait values) and traits variability (plasticity). Our aim of this study was to examine (i) changes of species diversity (species richness and Shannon-Wiener index) and ANPP following fertilization; (ii) which species traits or community-weighted mean (CWM) traits can determine ANPP, as expected from the 'biomass ratio hypothesis'; and (iii) the relative role of intra-specific and inter-specific trait variability in this process following fertilization. Methods We measured ANPP and four key plant functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), mature plant height (MPH) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) for 25 component species along a fertilization gradient in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, trait variation of species was assessed using coefficients of variation (CV), and we calculated the ratio of the CVintra to the CVinter. Important Findings Our results showed that: (i) fertilization significantly reduced species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index, but significantly increased ANPP; (ii) there was a significant positive correlation between ANPP and CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH, yet there was no significant relationship between ANPP and CWM-LNC or CWM-LDMC; (iii) intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH was found to be much greater than inter-specific variability, especially at the higher fertilization levels. We concluded that CWM-SLA and CWM-MPH can be used to assess the impacts of species changes on ecosystem functioning, and dominant species can maximize resource use through intra-specific variability in SLA and MPH to compensate for the loss of species following fertilization, therefore maintaining high community productivity.","[Li, Wei; Cheng, Jimin] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Jing, Guanghua; Cheng, Jimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei; Jing, Guanghua; Cheng, Jimin] Minist Water Resource, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jie] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 22 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China; [Epstein, Howard E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, 291 McCormick Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Virginia; Lanzhou University","Li, W (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, 26 Xinong Rd, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liwei2013@nwsuaf.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [41230852]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-EW-TZ-G10]; Northwest A F University [Z109021107, Z109021307, QN2013070]; West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences [K318021305]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2016JQ3008]; China Scholarship Council",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Northwest A F University; West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (41230852), Key Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KJZD-EW-TZ-G10), Northwest A & F University (Z109021107, Z109021307, QN2013070), West Light Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (K318021305), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2016JQ3008) and the China Scholarship Council.",NA,61,12,13,4,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

However, the quest to explain why diverse cropping systems are more productive than monocultures remains a central goal in agricultural science. In a mesocosm experiment, we constructed monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures from eight crop species with or without fertilizer and both in temperate Switzerland and dry, Mediterranean Spain. We measured physical factors and plant traits and related these in structural equation models to selection and complementarity effects to explain seed yield differences between monocultures and mixtures. Increased crop diversity increased seed yield in Switzerland. This positive biodiversity effect was driven to almost the same extent by selection and complementarity effects, which increased with plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), respectively. Also, ecological processes driving seed yield increases from monocultures to mixtures differed from those responsible for seed yield increases through the diversification of mixtures from two to four species. Whereas selection effects were mainly driven by one species, complementarity effects were linked to larger leaf area per unit leaf weight. Seed yield increases due to mixture diversification were driven only by complementarity effects and were not mediated through the measured traits, suggesting that ecological processes beyond those measured in this study were responsible for positive diversity effects on yield beyond two-species mixtures. By understanding the drivers of positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, we can improve our ability to predict species combinations that enhance ecosystem functioning and can promote sustainable agricultural production.","[Engbersen, Nadine; Stefan, Laura; Schob, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brooker, Rob W.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen, Scotland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; James Hutton Institute,"Engbersen, N (autor correspondente), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",nadine.engbersen@usys.ethz.ch,"Stefan, Laura/AAA-9294-2022; Schöb, Christian/B-6083-2008; Stefan, Laura/HKW-4236-2023","Stefan, Laura/0000-0003-0798-9782; Schöb, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286; Stefan, Laura/0000-0003-0798-9782",Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3_170645],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are grateful to Elisa Pizarro Carbonell, Carlos Barriga Cabanillas and Anja Schmutz for their help with the mesocosm experiment, and Johan Six for comments on the experimental design.

Most experimental studies report that higher species or functional group diversity increases resistance to invasion, but the role of genetic diversity is unknown. We used a model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), to investigate relationships between genotypic richness and community invasibility by creating communities with 1, 2, 4, and 8 genotypes of A. thaliana at constant low (417 plants m(-2)) and high (834 plants m(-2)) densities, that once established, were invaded with a congener, Arabidopsis suecica. To reduce the potential effects of methodological confounding related to sampling effects, variance reduction effects, or confounding of abundance with diversity, we (1) created random communities from a relatively large pool of functionally and phenotypically similar genotypes, (2) evaluated individual and community traits across richness treatments, and (3) analyzed similarity of communities within treatments (for quasi- replication) and between adjacent treatments (for nestedness). Genotypic richness had no effect on A. suecica demography (emergence, survivorship), size (biomass, rosette area), or reproductive potential (rates of bolting and fruiting or number and size of bolts). In contrast, the density of A. thaliana genotypes had strong effects on the size and reproductive potential of A. suecica, which suggests that characteristics of the recipient community other than genotypic richness (e.g. light) form the most important determinant of community invasibility. Individual- and community-level traits of community members (cover, biomass, survivorship) did not differ among richness treatments, and within- and between-treatment similarity was reduced (relative to other recent experiments) but not eliminated. We evaluate our results vis-a-vis recent analyses of diversity-invasibility experiments, and provide directions for future investigations of genetic diversity.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Weltzin, JF (autor correspondente), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA.",,"Von Holle, Betsy/GZG-5112-2022; Muth, Norris Z./C-3324-2008","Von Holle, Betsy/0000-0002-3116-3027; Muth, Norris Z./0000-0002-8005-4492",,,,NA,76,50,53,2,43,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2003,103,3,,,,NA,505,518,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12389.x,0,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,750HU,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000186985900007,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore important to conduct investigations across a range of flooding gradients to assess the impact of flooding depth on wetland vegetation. We conducted this study to identify the pattern of plant height, species richness and aboveground biomass variation along the flooding gradient in floodplain wetlands located in Northeast China. We found that the response of dominant species height to the flooding gradient depends on specific species, i.e., a quadratic response for Carex lasiocarpa, a negative correlation for Calamagrostis angustifolia, and no response for Carex appendiculata. Species richness showed an intermediate effect along the vegetation zone from marsh to wet meadow while aboveground biomass increased. When the communities were analysed separately, only the water table depth had significant impact on species richness for two Carex communities and no variable for C. angustifolia community, while height of dominant species influenced aboveground biomass. When the three abovementioned communities were grouped together, variations in species richness were mainly determined by community type, water table depth and community mean height, while variations in aboveground biomass were driven by community type and the height of dominant species. These findings indicate that if habitat drying of these herbaceous wetlands in this region continues, then two Carex marshes would be replaced gradually by C. angustifolia wet meadow in the near future. This will lead to a reduction in biodiversity and an increase in productivity and carbon budget. Meanwhile, functional traits must be considered, and should be a focus of attention in future studies on the species diversity and ecosystem function in this region.","[Lou, Yanjing; Pan, Yanwen; Gao, Chuanyu; Jiang, Ming; Lu, Xianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Xu, Y.

However, biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships may be fundamentally different across dense-wooded and light-wooded species, as they are clustered at two opposite extremes of the wood economics spectrum. Here we analyzed BEF relationships through mediations of functional dominance (i.e. community-weighted mean, CWM) and functional divergence (FDvar) of plant maximum height (H) while accounting for the effects of other characteristics of homegardens, across dense-wooded, light-wooded and all species, by using structural equation modelling (SEM) on 45 homegarden agroforestry systems in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The dense-wooded SEM accounted for 69% variation in aboveground biomass through significant positive direct effects of CWM H (beta = 0.51) and FDvar H (beta = 0.20), and indirect effect of species diversity via FDvar H on aboveground biomass (beta = 0.12). Although the light-wooded SEM accounted for 19% variation in aboveground biomass, the BEF relationships were non-significant. Regardless of SEMs, FDvar H but not CWM H was significantly positively related to species diversity. None of the BEF relationships was statistically significant when dense-wooded and light-wooded species were mixed. From a theoretical aspect, these positive BEF relationships are driven by both dominant and complementarity dense-wooded species. From a practical aspect, the positive BEF relationships support the feasibility of UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) initiative in studied agroforests, which aims to enhance carbon storage in aboveground biomass while conserving biodiversity. Hence, this study suggests that wood density is a potential sustainability indicator for better management of agroforest-ecosystem while driving positive BEF relationships.","[Ali, Arshad] South China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Spatial Ecol Lab, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mattsson, Eskil] Chalmers Univ Technol, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",South China Normal University; Chalmers University of Technology,"Mattsson, E (autor correspondente), Chalmers Univ Technol, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",eskil.mattsson@chalmers.se,"Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; Mattsson, Eskil/0000-0001-8610-4844",Swedish Energy Agency [35586-1]; Gothenburg Centre for Global Development (GCGD); Guangdong Provincial Government [205588],Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC)); Gothenburg Centre for Global Development (GCGD); Guangdong Provincial Government,This work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency (Grant No. 35586-1) and the Gothenburg Centre for Global Development (GCGD).

We examined the utility of 12 easy-to-measure leaf traits (fresh weight to dry weight ratio, specific leaf area (SLA), osmolality, delta C-13, delta N-15, and concentrations of key nutrients) to detect edge effects on the function of a dominant woodland tree, Eucalyptus arenacea Marginson & Ladiges. The study included replicate E. arenacea trees at the woodland edge (0 m) and interior (75 m from edge) of three woodlands adjoined by pasture and three woodlands adjoined by plantation established on pasture. Leaf traits proved useful in identifying potentially degrading processes at woodland edges. Notably, greater leaf P concentrations and delta N-15 in edge than interior trees irrespective of edge type (pasture versus plantation) indicated persistent effects of nutrient enrichment from agricultural practices; and leaf osmolality and Na concentrations indicated greatest exposure of woodland trees to salinity at pasture edges. Nonetheless, leaf traits proved less useful in detecting edge effects on tree physiology, with most traits being non-responsive to a pronounced interactive effect of edge type and distance from edge on physiological measures. In addition, negative correlations between SLA and physiological measures of tree productivity were contrary to global relationships. Overall, we found that although particular leaf traits indicated potentially degrading processes of nutrient enrichment and salinisation, they were not reliable indicators of small-scale edge effects on the physiological function of E. arenacea.","[Wright, Thomas E.; Tausz, Michael; Bennett, Lauren T.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia; [Wright, Thomas E.] Univ Melbourne, CRC Forestry, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia; [Kasel, Sabine] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Wright, TE (autor correspondente), AECOM, Level 45,80 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",thomas.wright@aecom.com,"Bennett, Lauren/G-9609-2016; Kasel, Sabine/AFQ-7971-2022; Tausz, Michael/AHC-9128-2022; Tausz, Michael/C-1990-2013; Bennett, Lauren/AGO-0700-2022","Bennett, Lauren/0000-0003-2472-062X; Tausz, Michael/0000-0001-8205-8561; Tausz, Michael/0000-0001-8205-8561; Bennett, Lauren/0000-0003-2472-062X",Cooperative Research Centre for Forestry; University of Melbourne (Melbourne Research Scholarship); Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment,"Cooperative Research Centre for Forestry(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); University of Melbourne (Melbourne Research Scholarship); Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment","The authors acknowledge Nola and Geoff Wright, Anne Miehs, Mark Hall and staff at Timbercorp for their assistance in field work.

Here, we investigated the functional composition and diversity of plant assemblages in different types of urban forests with the intent to predict the stability of the functions provided by these forests through the functional redundancy and response diversity of species. For this, we used data from non-urban mature forests, remnant urban forests, urban forests regenerated from croplands and urban forests regenerated from soil denudation, all located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results showed that species functional composition shifted among urban and non-urban forests. However, functional diversity was lost only in urban forests with some previous use, indicating that the natural regeneration of urban forests after previous land use results in functionally poor forests. Urban forests regenerated from soil denudation (more intense disturbance) had a lower functional diversity. Conversely, urban forests regenerated from cropland (less intense disturbance) showed only a reduction in the number of functions provided. Our analysis also revealed the reduced functional redundancy and response diversity of urban forests with previous land use, which may indicate a greater vulnerability of the functions provided by these forests. Thus, we emphasise in this study the importance of land use history for decision making in urban forest conservation policies and highlight the crucial role of natural remnant urban forests as reservoirs of functional diversity and stability in highly degraded and fragmented landscapes.","[Pyles, Marcela, V; Borges, Erica Rievrs; Carvalho, Fabricio Alvim] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Ciencias Biol, Campus Univ, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, Brazil; [Pyles, Marcela, V; van den Berg, Eduardo] Univ Fed Lavras UFLA, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol & Conservacao, BR-3720000 Lavras, Brazil; [Magnago, Luiz F.

These impacts can be exacerbated by synergism with other global change drivers, such as biological invasions. Furcraea foetida (Asparagaceae) is a CAM species native to Central America and northern South America that is currently invading coastal ecosystems in the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil. The species propagates clonally by bulbils, forming dense clusters that exclude native species. We addressed whether warming may favor or impair development of F. foetida bulbils based on functional traits and assessed whether plant cover of native species influenced F. foetida establishment in a rocky shore ecosystem. We used open-top chambers during summer and autumn, which increased air temperature during daylight hours by 0.4 A degrees C relative to ambient conditions. This short-term warming effect increased the leaf length of bulbils but had no effect on number of leaves, dry mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), or photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). However, an increase in vegetation cover decreased LDMC and helped maintain high Fv/Fm, having an indirect positive effect on F. foetida establishment that suggests a facilitation interaction in this extreme environment. Even though the manipulated temperature did not reach IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) forecasts for 2100, our data show that even small, short-term changes in temperature affected plant performance. Thus, we suggest that F. foetida may be favored in a scenario of climate change, increasing its negative effects on biodiversity of coastal ecosystems.","[Barbosa, Cristiana; Peroni, Nivaldo; Castellani, Tania Tarabini] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campus Univ Trindade, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Pugnaire, Francisco I.] Consejo Super Invest Cient EEZA CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria, Spain",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA),"Barbosa, C (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campus Univ Trindade, BR-88040900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",crisilha@gmail.com,"Pugnaire, Francisco I./A-7150-2008; Peroni, Nivaldo/ABA-2663-2021; Peroni, Nivaldo/AAU-4701-2020","Pugnaire, Francisco I./0000-0002-1227-6827; Peroni, Nivaldo/0000-0002-6770-5377; Peroni, Nivaldo/0000-0002-6770-5377","CAPES/CNPq Science without Borders'' Program through the project Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems'' [114A-2013]; Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC); CNPq; CAPES","CAPES/CNPq Science without Borders'' Program through the project Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems''; Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","This research was supported by the CAPES/CNPq Science without Borders'' Program through the project Plant interactions and community dynamics in tropical, seasonal systems'' (No 114A-2013) and by the Postgraduate Program in Ecology (PPGECO/UFSC).

In a designed pot experiment, we selected two early-successional tree species (Pinus massoniana Lamb., Liquidambar formosana Hance.) and two late-successional tree species (Schima superba Champ., Elaeocarpus decipiens Hemsl.) and planted four saplings in one pot with regard to tree species diversity (monoculture, two species and four species mixtures), each combination replicated four times. In this three-year duration experiment, the effect of tree species diversity, tree identity, and functional traits on sapling growth (tree height, ground diameter, crown projection area), were analyzed. The results showed that the increments of ground diameter and crown projection area increased with tree species richness, whereas the mean tree height increment showed the opposite effect. This growth variation was species specific and related to functional traits (early or late succession), as the increments of the early successional tree species (P. massoniana Lamb. and L. formosana Hance.) had a positive correlation with tree species richness, while the late successional tree species (E. decipiens Hemsl. and S. superba Champ.) showed negative effects.

Although change in the mean values are important, there is increasing evidence that plant distribution, survival, and productivity respond to extremes rather than to the average climatic condition. The present study aims to assess the effects of both mean and extreme climatic conditions on radial growth and functional anatomical traits using long-term tree-ring time series of two co-existing Quercus spp. from a drought-prone site in Southern Italy. In particular, this is the first attempt to apply the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) technique and Bayesian modeling procedures to xylem traits data set, with the aim of (i) detecting non-linear long-term responses to climate and (ii) exploring relationships between climate extreme and xylem traits variability in terms of probability of occurrence. This study demonstrates the usefulness of long-term xylem trait chronologies as records of environmental conditions at annual resolution. Statistical analyses revealed that most of the variability in tree-ring width and specific hydraulic conductivity might be explained by cambial age. Additionally, results highlighted appreciable relationships between xylem traits and climate variability more than tree -ring width, supporting also the evidence that the plant hydraulic traits are closely linked to local climate extremes rather than average climatic conditions. We reported that the probability of extreme departure in specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks) rises at extreme values of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Therefore, changing frequency or intensity of extreme events might overcome the adaptive limits of vascular transport, resulting in substantial reduction of hydraulic functionality and, hence increased incidence of xylem dysfunctions.","[Rita, Angelo; Saracino, Antonio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Portici, Italy; [Rita, Angelo; Borghetti, Marco; Todaro, Luigi] Univ Basilicata, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, Potenza, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Basilicata,"Rita, A (autor correspondente), Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Agr, Portici, Italy.;Rita, A (autor correspondente), Univ Basilicata, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, Potenza, Italy.",angelo.rita@unina.it,"Todaro, Luigi/A-3745-2019; Rita, Angelo/E-1233-2015; Borghetti, Marco/C-4262-2012","Todaro, Luigi/0000-0001-7230-2188; Rita, Angelo/0000-0002-6579-7925; Borghetti, Marco/0000-0003-3159-6655; Saracino, Antonio/0000-0002-1499-2317","MIUR-PRIN grant [2012E3F3LK]; MIUR-PRIN [2002075152-004, 2005072877-002]","MIUR-PRIN grant(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); MIUR-PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","The research jointly funded by the MIUR-PRIN grant No. 2012E3F3LK Global change effects on the productivity and radiative forcing of Italian forests: a novel retrospective, experimental, and prognostic analysis granted to MB and MIUR-PRIN No. 2002075152-004 and No. 2005072877-002 granted to AS.",NA,78,21,21,2,48,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Precipitation is considered to be a key driver of ecosystem processes in mesic grasslands, and climate models predict changes in the amount and intensity of precipitation under future global change scenarios. Although most experimental rainfall studies decrease precipitation, seasonal rainfall is predicted to increase in the northern Great Plains under climate change. 2. We analysed changes in community composition and structure of upland and lowland native tallgrass prairie in central Kansas, USA, subjected to 19 years of irrigation designed to eliminate moisture stress throughout the growing season. 3. Irrigation had limited effects on species richness in both upland and lowland prairie. Total cover increased significantly and consistently with irrigation in drier uplands and in more mesic lowlands. Abundance of rhizomatous, tall, perennial species as well as C3 forbs increased with irrigation. 4. The strongest response to irrigation came within the dominant functional type, C4 perennial grasses. Panicum virgatum became the dominant species in irrigated lowlands, whereas Andropogon gerardii remained the dominant species in irrigated uplands and in control plots. Overall, irrigation had less effect on community composition and structure than other known drivers of grassland structure and function. 5. In comparison with other studies, our results demonstrate that water addition has less of an impact than fire, grazing or nitrogen addition on composition and dynamics in this mesic grassland. The strongest response to long-term irrigation occurred within the dominant functional type: tall, perennial, rhizomatous, C4 grasses. Thus, functional redundancy will buffer this ecosystem from potential increases in rainfall due to climate change. Finally, our results highlight the limited utility of qualitative functional traits to predict how this mesic grassland will respond to climate change.","[Collins, Scott L.; Koerner, Sally E.; Plaut, Jennifer A.; Okie, Jordan G.; Brese, Daniel; Calabrese, Laura B.; Carvajal, Alejandra; Evansen, Ryan J.; Nonaka, Etsuko] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87103 USA",University of New Mexico,"Collins, SL (autor correspondente), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC03 2020, Albuquerque, NM 87103 USA.",scollins@sevilleta.unm.edu,"Koerner, Sally E./I-1701-2019; Nonaka, Etsuko/J-7395-2019; Collins, Scott L/P-7742-2014","Koerner, Sally E./0000-0001-6403-7513; Nonaka, Etsuko/0000-0001-6563-2840; Collins, Scott L/0000-0002-0193-2892","NSF [EF-0553768]; University of California, Santa Barbara; State of California; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [0823341] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California, Santa Barbara(University of California System); State of California; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We thank Alan Knapp for comments on an earlier version of the manuscript, Christian Gunning for help with R programming and Meghan Avolio for the repeated measures ANOVAs.

While experimental and theoretical studies have produced much knowledge of how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning, it remains poorly understood how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship. To develop a framework that connects habitat fragmentation to the BEF relationship from a landscape perspective. We reviewed the literature on habitat fragmentation, BEF, and related fields, and developed a framework to analyze how habitat fragmentation affects the BEF relationship through altering biodiversity, environmental conditions, and both, based on the pattern-process-scale perspective in landscape ecology. Our synthesis of the literature suggests that habitat fragmentation can alter BEF relationship through several processes. First, habitat fragmentation causes the non-random loss of species that make major contributions to ecosystem functioning (decreasing sampling effect), and reduces mutualistic interactions (decreasing complementarity effects) regardless of the changes in species richness. Second, environmental conditions within patches and ecological flows among patches vary significantly with the degree of fragmentation, which potentially contributes to and modulates the BEF relationship. Habitat fragmentation can affect the BEF relationship directly by altering community composition, as well as indirectly by changing environmental conditions within and among habitat patches on both local and landscape levels. The BEF relationship obtained from small plots and over short time periods may not fully represent that in real landscapes that are fragmented, dynamic, and continuously influenced by myriad human activities on different scales in time and space.","[Liu, Jiajia; Liu, Jinliang; Yu, Mingjian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wilson, Maxwell; Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Hu, Guang] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianguo] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wu, Jianguo] Beijing Normal Univ, CHESS, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Zhejiang Sci-Tech University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Beijing Normal University,"Yu, MJ (autor correspondente), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",fishmj202@hotmail.com,"Hu, Guang/AAF-1689-2020; Wu, Jianguo/G-6267-2010; Liu, Jinliang/B-1716-2015; Liu, Jiajia/I-5253-2019","Wu, Jianguo/0000-0002-1182-3024; Liu, Jinliang/0000-0002-2476-1803; Liu, Jiajia/0000-0002-1923-5964; Hu, Guang/0000-0002-4390-6166; yu, ming jian/0000-0001-8060-8427","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31361123001, 31500382, 31210103908]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-1342754, DEB-1342757]; 521 Talent Project of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); 521 Talent Project of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University(Zhejiang Sci-Tech University),"This paper was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31361123001, 31500382, 31210103908), the US National Science Foundation (DEB-1342754 and DEB-1342757) and the 521 Talent Project of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University.

We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and lidar (light detection and ranging) to quantify changes in three-dimensional forest structure and canopy functional traits in twenty 25 ha landscapes distributed along a 3300m elevation gradient from lowland Amazonia to treeline in the Peruvian Andes. Elevation was positively correlated with lidar-estimated canopy gap density and understory vegetation cover, and negatively related to canopy height and the vertical partitioning of vegetation in canopies. Increases in canopy gap density were tightly linked to increases in understory plant cover, and larger gaps (20-200 m(2)) produced 2530 times the response in understory cover than did smaller gaps (< 5 m(2)). Vegetation NDVI and photosynthetic fractional cover decreased, while exposed non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil increased, with elevation. Scaling of gap size to gap frequency (lambda) was, however, nearly constant along the elevation gradient. When combined with other canopy structural and functional trait information, this suggests near-constant canopy turnover rates from the lowlands to treeline, which occurs independent of decreasing biomass or productivity with increasing elevation. Our results provide the first landscape-scale quantification of forest structure and canopy functional traits with changing elevation, thereby improving our understanding of disturbance, demography and ecosystem processes in the Andes-to-Amazon corridor.","[Asner, G.

However, whether and to what degree biodiversity influences biomass of subtropical forests remains uncertain. In this study, we analyzed the effects of tree biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity) on stand biomass at three stages (early, mid and late) of succession in subtropical forests. As forest succession progressed, we found that the changes in species diversity were different compared with those of functional and phylogenetic diversity. Most of the indices of species and functional and phylogenetic diversity were not significantly correlated with stand biomass at two spatial grains (plot sizes of 10 m x 10 m and 20 m x 30 m). However, when other abiotic and biotic factors (i.e., altitude, canopy light, stem density and forest phase) were included with diversity indices in mixed models to explain biomass, the effect of functional diversity on biomass was significant at both resolution. For species diversity indices, the effect was significant at the 20 m x 30 m resolution, and phylogenetic diversity had no significant effect. Our results indicate that biodiversity affects forest biomass during the succession of a subtropical forest and suggest that functional diversity may provide a better metric than species or phylogenetic diversity for determining the biodiversity effect on biomass. Moreover, our results indicate that the diverse conclusions reached in other BEF analyses might be explained by differences in the plot size examined and the diversity metrics selected. Because the bivariate relationship between biodiversity and biomass can be strongly confounded by covarying abiotic and biotic factors, we suggest that the effects of abiotic factors, succession stage, and management practices on BEF should be carefully considered in future research.

Most efforts to date have involved two-dimensional mapping of traits, typically representing top-of-canopy conditions. However, traits and their associated biological functions vary through the canopy vertical profile, such that incorporating information about vertical patterns may improve modeling of ecosystem processes like primary productivity. In 2016 and 2017, we collected extensive field data in forests in Domain 5 (Great Lakes) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to characterize the vertical variation in leaf mass per area (LMA), an important foliar trait related to plant growth and defense. Fieldwork was coincident with NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) overflights which collected imaging spectroscopy and lidar data. Using imaging spectroscopy to map top-of-canopy LMA and lidar to model vertical gradients of transmittance, we developed a method to map three-dimensional patterns in LMA in temperate broadleaf forests. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate top-of-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.57, RMSE 10.8 g m(-2)), which, along with lidar-derived metrics of light transmittance and height, was used in a multilevel regression to model within-canopy LMA (R-2: 0.78, RMSE 8.3 g m(-2)). The coupled models accurately estimated LMA throughout the canopy without taking into account species composition (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE: 8.5 g m(-2)).","[Chlus, Adam; Kruger, Eric L.; Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chlus, A (autor correspondente), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",chlus@wisc.edu; elkruger@wisc.edu; ptownsend@wisc.edu,,"Chlus, Adam/0000-0001-6719-9956","NSF Macrosystems Biology and Early NEON Science [1638720]; USDA McIntire-Stennis awards [WIS1809, WIS3008]",NSF Macrosystems Biology and Early NEON Science; USDA McIntire-Stennis awards,"We thank Andrew Jablonski, Aidan Mazur, Benjamin Spaier, John Clare, Brendan Heberlein, Ittai Herrmann, Abigail Ernst, Hannah Manninen and Alex Brito for providing field assistance.

Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and biomass will be crucial for soil and water conservation of the whole basin of the Yellow River. The positive effects of biodiversity on aboveground biomass are altered via two fundamental mechanisms-niche complementarity and selection effects-and are modulated by environmental context and community structure in natural communities. Most studies of biodiversity-biomass relationships have focused on grasslands and forests, rather than on shrublands. We combine multiple biotic variables (biodiversity, functional identity and community structural attributes) and environmental context with aboveground biomass across shrubland habitat types (temperate hilly, temperate montane and subtropical montane) at neighbourhood and community spatial scales, to evaluate the effects of these factors on shrubland aboveground biomass, in the Yellow River basin. We found aboveground biomass was influenced primarily by the community-weighted mean plant maximum height, followed by species richness and community-weighted mean specific leaf area. Furthermore, individual plant size inequality, mean annual precipitation and water availability either directly or indirectly influenced aboveground biomass. The biodiversity-aboveground biomass relationship was stronger at the broader spatial scale. Thus, our findings indicate that both niche complementarity and selection effects shape the effects of biodiversity on shrubland aboveground biomass, although selection effects are more important. Moreover, they indicate that water is the most important environmental factor for determining aboveground biomass, and suggest that community structure and spatial scale could influence shrubland aboveground biomass and its response to biodiversity.

Frequent rainfall, canopy shade and nutrient availability are the main factors influencing recruitment of tree saplings. Grass competition has potential to change the tree establishment dynamics by interacting with these factors. The factors affecting tree sapling establishment have been well studied and tested in arid and semi-arid environments (approx. 0.350-0.750 m mean annual precipitation [MAP]) compared to humid (>1.000 m MAP) savanna ecosystems. We studied the effects of water (frequent irrigation vs. rainfall), shade (presence vs. absence), nutrients (addition vs. no addition) and grass competition (presence vs. absence) on sapling survival and functional traits related to growth and size of four dominant humid savanna species and four dominant mesic savanna species (approx. 0.750 m MAP), under controlled field conditions in a humid South African savanna. None of the treatments had an effect on sapling survival. Growth of the saplings did not depend on the frequency of watering, probably due to high rainfall received in humid savannas. Shade had a strong negative effect on sapling growth, suppressing the beneficial effects of nutrient availability and absence of grass competition. Net positive effects of nutrient availability had less influence over sapling growth than the negative effects exerted by grass competition. Overall shoot growth increased with nutrient addition while investment in leaves drastically declined with grass competition. We conclude that canopy shade is a strong potential driver of structure and function of humid savanna ecosystems, although we recognize that nutrient limitation and grass competition additionally influence tree sapling establishment.","[Vadigi, Snehalatha; Ward, David] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Vadigi, S (autor correspondente), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",ward@ukzn.ac.za,,,"Shell Foundation, The Netherlands; National Research Foundation, South Africa","Shell Foundation, The Netherlands(Netherlands Government); National Research Foundation, South Africa(National Research Foundation - South AfricaSouth African Medical Research Council)","This study was funded by The Shell Foundation, The Netherlands and the National Research Foundation, South Africa.

Experimental work has led to the proposal of mechanisms such as niche complementarity. However, few attempts have been made to confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests. Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved questions is whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic diversity) better relates to tree productivity? Location Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern Canada. Methods Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for tree productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices, were included in a structural equation model where links (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit, making structural equation modelling the best tool to explore such complicated causal networks. Results This is the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity with control for climatic and environmental conditions. Important differences were noted between the two forest biomes investigated. Main conclusions We show for the first time that complementarity may be less important in temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive environment where competitive exclusion is the most probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial interactions between species may be more important. The present work is also a framework for the analysis of large datasets in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) research.","[Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Paquette, A (autor correspondente), Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Forest Res, POB 8888,Ctr Ville Stn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",alain.paquette@gmail.com,"Paquette, Alain/F-4919-2011",,,,,NA,52,581,608,22,604,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Less is known about the role of biodiversity in natural ecosystems, including forests, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling and climate. In general, experimental manipulations of tree diversity will take decades to yield final results. To date, biodiversity effects in natural forests therefore have only been reported from sample surveys or meta-analyses with plots not initially selected for diversity. We studied biomass and growth of subtropical forests stands in southeastern China. Taking advantage of variation in species recruitment during secondary succession, we adopted a comparative study design selecting forest plots to span a gradient in species richness. We repeatedly censored the stem diameter of two tree size cohorts, comprising 93 species belonging to 57 genera and 33 families. Tree size and growth were analyzed in dependence of species richness, the functional diversity of growth-related traits, and phylogenetic diversity, using both general linear and structural equation modeling. Successional age covaried with diversity, but differently so in the two size cohorts. Plot-level stem basal area and growth were positively related with species richness, while growth was negatively related to successional age. The productivity increase in species-rich, functionally and phylogenetically diverse plots was driven by both larger mean sizes and larger numbers of trees. The biodiversity effects we report exceed those from experimental studies, sample surveys and meta-analyses, suggesting that subtropical tree diversity is an important driver of forest productivity and re-growth after disturbance that supports the provision of ecological services by these ecosystems.","[Barrufol, Martin; Schmid, Bernhard; Hector, Andrew; Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Geobot & Bot Garden, Inst Biol, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Chi, Xiulian; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chi, Xiulian; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Michalski, Stefan] UFZ, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany","University of Zurich; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)","Niklaus, PA (autor correspondente), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",pascal.niklaus@ieu.uzh.ch,"Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Baruffol, Martin/A-2406-2014; Michalski, Stefan G/O-5774-2015; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Chi, Xiulian/A-8898-2015; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Tang, Zhiyao/B-8795-2008; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Baruffol, Martin/0000-0001-9358-5885; Michalski, Stefan G/0000-0002-8969-7355; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Tang, Zhiyao/0000-0003-0154-6403","German Science Foundation [DFG FOR 891/1]; Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion [GZ 524, 592, 698, 699]; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC 31021001]; National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change [2010CB50600]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change(National Basic Research Program of China),"Funding was provided by the German Science Foundation (http://www.dfg.de; DFG FOR 891/1), the Sino-German Centre for Research Promotion (http://www.sinogermanscience.org.cn; GZ 524, 592, 698 and 699), the National Science Foundation of China (http://www.nsfc.gov.cn; NSFC 31021001), and the National Basic Research Program of China on Global Change (http://www.973.gov.cn/Default_3.aspx; #2010CB50600).

Owing to land reclamation, these D. angustifolia wetland ecosystems are rapidly shrinking on the landscape, threatening ecosystem functioning and regional ecological security. Converting farmlands to wetlands serves as an ecological engineering widely used for natural restoration in Sangjiang Plain. Vegetation restoration process of restored D. angustifolia wetlands needs to be fully assessed. However, limited information is available for uncovering the impact of restoration time on ecological vegetative characteristics under natural succession. In this study, vegetation survey and sampling were carried out in six restored D. angustifolia wetlands with a chronosequence (2-, 4-, 8-, 13-, 16-, 20-year restoration), as well as the undisturbed D. angustifolia wetland. Plant community composition changed greatly during the past two decades. In the 2-year and 4-year restored wetlands, farmland weeds Artemisia argyi and Calamagrostis brachytricha were the dominant species. Plant communities were gradually dominated by D. angustifolia and Carex spp. with the increase of restoration time. Species diversity in restored wetlands was higher than that in undisturbed wetland and decreased with restoration time increasing. Plant height and coverage increased with the increase of the restoration time, whereas the plant density generally decreased. The plant communities in restored wetlands were increasingly close to that in the undisturbed wetland. The forb, sedge and grass plants accumulated more biomass in 2-year, 8-year and 20-year restored wetlands, respectively. Regression between the grass biomass and species diversity is significantly negative (p <= 0.05). Results in this study suggest that the vegetation of cultivated D. angustifolia wetland could be restored effectively through natural succession, although there were some functional differences between restored and undisturbed D. angustifolia wetlands. Community composition variance and functional traits based on vital attributes can be used to reliably predict changes in diversity of species in response to natural restoration.","[An, Yu; Tong, Shouzheng; Lu, Xianguo; Wang, Xuehong; Wang, Guodong; Liu, Xiaohui; Zhang, Dongjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yang] Jilin Acad Agr Sci, Changchun 130124, Jilin, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences","An, Y; Tong, SZ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401102]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0500403],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41401102) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0500403).

Nitrogen pools were significantly affected by both plant diversity and community composition. Two years after sowing, nitrogen pools in Germany and Switzerland strongly increased in the presence of legumes. Legume effects on nitrogen pools were less pronounced at the Swedish, Irish and Portuguese site. In Greece and UK there were no legume effects. Nitrogen concentration in total above-ground biomass was quite invariable at 1.66 +/- 0.03% across all sites and diversity treatments. Thus, the presence of legumes had a positive effect oil nitrogen pools by significantly increasing above-ground biomass, i.e. by increases in vegetation quantity rather than quality. At the German site with the strongest legume effect on nitrogen pools and biomass, nitrogen that was fixed symbiotically by legumes was transferred to the other plant functional groups (grasses and herbs) but varied depending on the particular legume species fixing N and the non-legume species taking it up. Nitrogenfixation by legumes therefore appeared to be one of the major functional traits of species that influenced nitrogen accumulation and biomass production, although effects varied among sites and legume species. This study demonstrates that the consequences of species loss on the nitrogen budget of plant communities may be more severe if legume species are lost. However, our data indicate that legume species differ in their N(2) fixation. Therefore, loss of an efficient N(2)-fixer (Trifolium in our study) may have a greater influence on the ecosystem function than loss of a less efficient species (Lotus in our study). Furthermore, there is indication that P availability in the soil facilitates the legume effect on biomass production and biomass nitrogen accumulation.","Univ Basel, Inst Bot, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland; Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; Univ Zurich, Inst Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Inst Super Agron, Dept Engn Florestal, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies, Biodivers Conservat Lab, GR-81100 Lesbos, Greece; Univ Reading, Dept Agr, Reading RG6 6AT, Berks, England; Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Environm Resource Management, Dublin 2, Ireland",University of Basel; Max Planck Society; University of Zurich; Imperial College London; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Universidade de Lisboa; University of Aegean; University of Reading; Kansas State University; University College Dublin,"Spehn, EM (autor correspondente), Univ Basel, Inst Bot, Schonbeinstr 6, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",eva.spehn@unibas.ch,"Caldeira, Maria/HPD-8762-2023; Caldeira, Maria/D-4107-2013; Hector, Andrew/H-4199-2011; Finn, John A/D-4635-2009; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Körner, Christian/B-6592-2014; Spehn, Eva/B-7070-2018; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022","Caldeira, Maria/0000-0002-3586-8526; Hector, Andrew/0000-0002-1309-7716; Finn, John A/0000-0003-3616-5563; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219; Körner, Christian/0000-0001-7768-7638; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Spehn, Eva M./0000-0002-5172-3415; Dimitrakopoulos, Panayiotis/0000-0002-8374-4392; Pereira, Joao/0000-0002-3658-5587",,,,NA,70,281,300,8,159,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2002,98,2,,,,NA,205,218,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.980203.x,0,NA,,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,588RD,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000177713700003,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed whether deficits in contemporary FD, relative to expectations based on contemporary environmental regions and species richness, were associated with glacial-interglacial climate stability and accessibility from glacial refugia. LocationEurope MethodsAtlas data on distributions of plant species and functional trait information were used to estimate functional richness (F-Rich) and dispersion (F-Disp) for approximate to 50x50km grid cells across Europe. Maximum expected FD was calculated using both quantile regression and a null-model approach, with species richness and contemporary environmental regions as constraints. Then, the proportion of the potential FD present in a grid cell - the realized-to-potential FD ratio (R/P) - was estimated. Spatial autoregressive modeling with information-theoretic multi-model selection were used to estimate the explanatory importance and predictive ability of glacial-interglacial climate instability and accessibility to recolonization from glacial refugia for R/P ratios. ResultsMinimum and median R/P ratios were 58% and 74% for F-Rich and 82% and 93% for F-Disp, showing that realized FD is often lower than expectations from species richness and contemporary environmental regions. FD deficits were significantly associated with glacial-interglacial Quaternary climate change (F-Rich-R-2: 0.52; F-Disp-R-2: 0.41), even after accounting for contemporary climate. F-Rich and F-Disp R/P ratios were the highest in areas with low climatic instability and close to the major glacial temperate refuge regions. Main ConclusionsRealized macro-scale FD patterns appear to be in moderate disequilibrium with contemporary richness and environmental regions. Importantly, small R/P ratios are significantly associated with both historical and contemporary climate. These findings suggest that future climate change may elicit long-term functional disequilibria and thus also have long-term consequences for ecosystem functioning.","[Ordonez, Alejandro; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Ordonez, A (autor correspondente), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",alejandro.ordonez@bios.au.dk,"Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020; Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012","Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551; Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862",HISTFUNC project (ERC) [310886],HISTFUNC project (ERC),"This article is a contribution of the HISTFUNC project (ERC Starting Grant 310886 to J-C.S.).

Although the complementary use of resources is discussed as an important mechanism explaining diversity effects, less is known about how resource availability controls the strength of diversity effects and how this response depends on the functional composition of plant communities. We studied aboveground biomass production in experimental monocultures, two-and four-species mixtures assembled from two independent pools of four perennial grassland species, each representing two functional groups (grasses, forbs) and two growth statures (small, tall), and exposed to different combinations of light and nutrient availability. On average, shade led to a decrease in aboveground biomass production of 24% while fertilization increased biomass production by 36%. Mixtures were on average more productive than expected from their monocultures (relative yield total, RYT>1) and showed positive net diversity effects (NE: +34% biomass increase; mixture minus mean monoculture biomass). Both trait-independent complementarity effects (TICE: +21%) and dominance effects (DE: +12%) positively contributed to net diversity effects, while trait-dependent complementarity effects were minor (TDCE: +1%). Shading did not alter diversity effects and overyielding. Fertilization decreased RYT and the proportion of biomass gain through TICE and TDCE, while DE increased. Diversity effects did not increase with species richness and were independent of functional group or growth stature composition. Trait-based analyses showed that the dominance of species with root and leaf traits related to resource conservation increased TICE. Traits indicating the tolerance of shade showed positive relationships with TDCE. Large DE were associated with the dominance of species with tall growth and low diversity in leaf nitrogen concentrations. Our field experiment shows that positive diversity effects are possible in grass-forb mixtures irrespective of differences in light availability, but that the chance for the complementary use of resources increases when nutrients are not available at excess.","[Siebenkaes, Alrun] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Dept Community Ecol, Theodor Lieser Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Schumacher, Jens] Univ Jena, Inst Math, Stochast, Ernst Abbe Pl 2, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Roscher, C (autor correspondente), Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, UFZ, Physiol Divers, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;Roscher, C (autor correspondente), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",christiane.roscher@ufz.de,,"Siebenkas, Alrun/0000-0001-9676-7094","German Science Foundation [RO2397/3, RO2397/4]",German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was funded by the German Science Foundation (RO2397/3, RO2397/4).

Here, we explore the role of life history strategies in mediating biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In particular, we evaluate how the composition, biomass (% cover), and richness of perennial (persistence >= 1 year) and ephemeral (persistence < 1 year) species change along a gradient of increasing seaweed species richness on a rocky shoreline. We show that the majority of biomass is comprised of perennial species, especially where overall richness is low, whereas the majority of species are ephemeral, especially where overall richness is high. We then present and discuss the results of an 18-month field manipulation quantifying the factorial effects of tidal elevation, wave exposure, herbivore removals, thermal and desiccation stress amelioration, and nutrient additions on perennial versus ephemeral species. In particular, the diversity of ephemeral species was strongly affected, relative to perennial species, by tidal elevation, wave exposure, and herbivory; herbivores reduced diversity of ephemeral species relative to perennials. Relative to perennial cover, ephemeral cover was greater higher on the shore, in more wave-exposed habitats, and where herbivores were removed, plots were unscreened, and/or nutrients were added. Thus, perennials and ephemerals responded differently to environmental context and experimental manipulation. We compared nitrate uptake and photosynthesis rates of ephemeral and perennial species and found that maximum nitrate uptake and photosynthesis rates of ephemerals were twice as high as those of perennials. These results highlight the disproportionate roles that ephemeral species play in mediating ecosystem-level processes. In combination with our comparisons of the diversity and cover of perennial and ephemeral species along a biodiversity gradient, these results demonstrate the utility of incorporating life history traits into our efforts to understand the functional consequences of biodiversity change.","[Bracken, Matthew E.

Conventional species-based, regional biodiversity assessments are rarely adequate for policy planning and decision making. We show how new ground and remotely sensed survey methods can be coordinated to help elucidate and predict relationships between biodiversity, land use and soil properties along complex biophysical gradients that typify many similar landscapes worldwide. In the lower Zambezi valley, Mozambique we used environmental, gradient directed transects (gradsects) to sample vascular plant species, plant functional types, vegetation structure, soil properties and land-use characteristics. Soil fertility indices were derived using novel multidimensional scaling of soil properties. To facilitate spatial analysis, we applied a probabilistic remote sensing approach, analyzing Landsat 7 satellite imagery to map photosynthetically active and inactive vegetation and bare soil along each gradsect. Despite the relatively low sample number, we found highly significant correlations between single and combined sets of specific plant, soil and remotely sensed variables that permitted testable spatial projections of biodiversity and soil fertility across the regional land-use mosaic. This integrative and rapid approach provides a low-cost, high-return and readily transferable methodology that permits the ready identification of testable biodiversity indicators for adaptive management of biodiversity and potential agricultural productivity.

Nonetheless, is poorly understood the extent to which these effects individually or in combination determine functional diversity, many studies have simply assumed equilibrium between current climate and functional diversity. We estimated functional richness (F-Rich) and dispersion (F-Disp) of North American broad-leaved trees by combining distribution and trait information. Then, we determined if contemporary water-energy availability, current topographic variability, historical climatic stability, and lagged immigration from glacial refugia co-determined the functional diversity of North American broad-leaved trees. We did this by assessing the directionality, magnitude, and relative importance of various contemporary and historical environmental factors know to affect species diversity. Contrasts were performed across all North America (Mexico, United States, and Canada), and areas within this region that were glaciated or ice-free during the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 21 000 yr ago). F-Rich and F-Disp showed distinct geographic patterns that are strongly associated with both contemporary environmental conditions and glacial-interglacial climate change. Model averaged regression coefficients and AIC-based variable relative importance estimates show that contemporary productivity (F-Rich-w(AIC): 1.0; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0), annual precipitation (F-Rich-w(AIC): 0.81; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0), and accessibility to glacial refugia (F-Rich-w(AIC): 0.92; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0) have the strongest associations to FRich and FDisp. Furthermore, the association of functional diversity with topographic heterogeneity showed steeper slopes in ice-free regions. These findings suggest that, contrary to the expectation climate-diversity equilibrium, functional diversity of North America broad-leaved trees is codetermined by current climate and lagged immigration from glacial refugia.","[Ordonez, Alejandro; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Ordonez, A (autor correspondente), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",alejandro.ordonez@bios.au.dk,"Svenning, Jens-Christian/C-8977-2012; Ordonez, Alejandro/ABH-2824-2020","Svenning, Jens-Christian/0000-0002-3415-0862; Ordonez, Alejandro/0000-0003-2873-4551",HISTFUNC project (ERC) [310886],HISTFUNC project (ERC),"The authors jointly developed the idea.

Understanding how plant diversity affects Delta AGB in diverse abiotic conditions is crucial in the face of anthropogenic environmental change. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the effects of plant diversity on growth dependent on the abiotic context, either supporting or rejecting the stress gradient hypothesis. However, we know little about how diversity influences mortality, which prevents us from knowing how diversity affects Delta AGB in diverse abiotic conditions. Location Across Canada (43-60 degrees N, 52-133 degrees W). Time period 1951-2016. Major taxa studied Ninety-three tree species. Methods We modelled the relationships of growth, mortality and Delta AGB with functional diversity that represented niche complementarity, while simultaneously accounting for the influence of functional identity and stand age. Results Growth and mortality increased, on average, with functional diversity, but the magnitude of the increase in growth was greater than that of mortality, resulting in an increase of Delta AGB. The positive relationship between growth and functional diversity was more prominent in more humid sites than in drier sites. Mortality increased with functional diversity in drier sites but did not increase in wetter sites. The positive relationship between Delta AGB and functional diversity was strengthened with water availability. Moreover, the positive relationship between growth and functional diversity became stronger with temperature, but the positive associations of diversity with mortality and Delta AGB were consistent across the gradient of temperature. Main conclusions Our results suggest that higher functional diversity leads to an increase in forest biomass accumulation owing to a greater positive effect of functional diversity on productivity than on mortality. However, in contrast to the stress gradient hypothesis, our findings show that the positive effect of functional diversity is more pronounced in an environment favourable for growth.","[Hisano, Masumi; Chen, Han Y.

Employing Brassica napus as a model, a multi-generational study was performed to investigate the potential trajectories of selection at elevated [CO2] in two different temperature regimes. To reveal phenotypic divergence at the manipulated [CO2] and temperature conditions, a full-factorial natural selection regime was established in a phytotron environment over the range of four generations. It is demonstrated that a directional response to selection at elevated [CO2] led to higher quantities of reproductive output over the range of investigated generations independent of the applied temperature regime. The increase in seed yield caused an increase in aboveground biomass. This suggests quantitative changes in the functions of carbon sequestration of plants subjected to increased levels of CO2 over the generational range investigated. The results of this study suggest that phenotypic divergence of plants selected under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration may drive the future functions of plant productivity to be different from projections that do not incorporate selection responses of plants. This study accentuates the importance of phenotypic responses across multiple generations in relation to our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics of future ecosystems. Furthermore, the positive selection response of reproductive output under increased [CO2] may ameliorate depressions in plant reproductive fitness caused by higher temperatures in situations where both factors co-occur.","[Frenck, Georg; van der Linden, Leon; Mikkelsen, Teis Norgaard; Jorgensen, Rikke Bagger] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Frenck, Georg; Brix, Hans] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark; Aarhus University,"Frenck, G (autor correspondente), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",g.frenck@sheffield.ac.uk,"Brix, Hans/C-5208-2008; Brix, Hans/AAN-5367-2020; Mikkelsen, Teis N/N-4089-2015","Brix, Hans/0000-0003-2771-2983; Brix, Hans/0000-0003-2771-2983; van der Linden, Leon/0000-0001-7995-9158; Mikkelsen, Teis Norgaard/0000-0001-7470-6522","International School of Biodiversity Science, Denmark - ISOBIS","International School of Biodiversity Science, Denmark - ISOBIS","The authors thank Bente A.

However, research on the complementary use of resources in mixed plant communities, and especially the impact of plant species richness on root water uptake, is limited. So far, these investigations have been hindered by a lack of methods allowing for the estimation of root water uptake profiles. The overarching aim of our study was to determine whether diverse grassland plant communities in general exploit soil water more deeply and whether this shift occurs all the time or only during times of enhanced water demand. Root water uptake was derived by analysing the diurnal decrease in soil water content separately at each measurement depth, thus yielding root water uptake profiles for 12 experimental grasslands communities with two different levels of species richness (4 and 16 sown species). Additional measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and root traits were used to identify differences in water relations between plant functional groups. Although the vertical root distribution did not differ between diversity levels, root water uptake shifted towards deeper layers (30 and 60cm) in more diverse plots during periods of high vapour pressure deficit. Our results indicate that the more diverse communities were able to adjust their root water uptake, resulting in increased water uptake per root area compared to less diverse communities (52% at 20cm, 118% at 30cm, and 570% at 60cm depth) and a more even distribution of water uptake over depth. Tall herbs, which had lower leaf water potential and higher stomatal conductance in more diverse mixtures, contributed disproportionately to dynamic niche partitioning in root water uptake. This study underpins the role of diversity in stabilizing ecosystem function and mitigating drought stress effects during future climate change scenarios. Furthermore, the results provide evidence that root water uptake is not solely controlled by root length density distribution in communities with high plant diversity but also by spatial shifts in water acquisition.

Nevertheless, there is paucity of data on the characterization of microhabitat effects on species/trait diversity and diversity-functional relationships in urban landscapes especially in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to; 1) analyze tree species diversity and composition of urban green space (UGS) types and urban zones, (2) describe the life history diversity of UGS types and urban zones and 3) examine the links between species and life history trait diversity and species productivity (carbon storage) in Kumasi, Ghana. Stratified random sampling was adopted in surveying 470 sampling plots and six streets of lengths ranging from 50m to 1km. About 176 tree species in 46 families were recorded within Kumasi. About 96 species were in an adjacent natural forest located at the outskirts of the city. Home gardens, institutional compounds, and public parks had the highest species richness of 76, 75 and 71, respectively while urban rangelands and farmlands were the least species rich with 6 and 23, respectively. Species richness (S) in the peri-urban (LDUZ, S=142) and core urban (HDUZ, S=108) were significantly different ((2)=15.7, p<0.0001, n=1). Native species richness was lowest in the core urban area and highest in the natural forest. Pioneers and anthropochory dispersed species were the most abundant, suggesting that this urban landscape is shaped by both environment and social filters. Tree species diversity and distribution depend on the type of UGS and portrays a perturbed landscape in the early seres of succession with the overall ecosystem function sustained by both species and life history trait diversities. The implications of these findings for improving urban biodiversity conservation and overall urban sustainability are discussed.","[Nero, Bertrand Festus] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, PMB, FRNR, Dept Forest Resources Technol, Kumasi, Ghana",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology,"Nero, BF (autor correspondente), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, PMB, FRNR, Dept Forest Resources Technol, Kumasi, Ghana.",bfn8puo@gmail.com,"?, ??/GZH-2618-2022; Nero, Bertrand/ABA-7231-2020",,Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis,Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis,"Funding for this project was provided by Federal Ministry of Economic Corporation via the German Academic Exchange Service and Foundation Fiat Panis.

It is well understood that biodiversity can increase the biomass through complementarity and mass-ratio effects, and the contribution of environmental factors and stand structure attributes to AGB was also observed. However, the relative influence of these factors in determining the AGB of Quercus forests remains poorly understood. Using a large dataset retrieved from 523 permanent forest inventory plots across Northeast China, we examined the effects of integrated multiple tree species diversity components (i.e., species richness, functional, and phylogenetic diversity), functional traits composition, environmental factors (climate and soil), stand age, and structure attributes (stand density, tree size diversity) on AGB based on structural equation models. We found that species richness and phylogenetic diversity both were not correlated with AGB. However, functional diversity positively affected AGB via an indirect effect in line with the complementarity effect. Moreover, the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area and height increased AGB directly and indirectly, respectively; demonstrating the mass-ratio effect. Furthermore, stand age, density, and tree size diversity were more important modulators of AGB than biodiversity. Our study highlights that biodiversity-AGB interaction is dependent on the regulation of stand structure that can be even more important for maintaining high biomass than biodiversity in temperate Quercus forests.","[Gao, Wen-Qiang; Lei, Xiang-Dong; Gao, Dong-Li] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Resource Informat Tech, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Management & Growth Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Dong-Li] Forest Prod Ind State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Planning & Design Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu-Tang] Jilin Forestry Inventory & Planning Inst, Changchun, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Resources Information Technique, CAF","Lei, XD (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Forest Resource Informat Tech, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Management & Growth Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xdlei@ifrit.ac.cn,,,"Forestry Public Welfare Scientific Research Project [201504303]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institute of CAF [CAFYBB2018ZB001-9, CAFYBB2018SY022]",Forestry Public Welfare Scientific Research Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institute of CAF,"Forestry Public Welfare Scientific Research Project, Grant/Award Number: 201504303; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institute of CAF, Grant/Award Number: CAFYBB2018ZB001-9 and CAFYBB2018SY022",NA,73,3,3,9,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Biomass production is influenced by management legacies, landscape configuration and soil, but these drivers are rarely studied simultaneously, nor is the role of changes in vegetation properties in linking them to biomass production. We assessed how management legacies affect biomass in secondary forests created by slash and burn in the central Congo Basin, and tested whether changes in productivity could be attributed to changes in stem density, functional diversity, functional identity or soil. Using data from 6452 trees in 96 fallow plots nested in 3 study sites, we looked for the main determinants of aboveground biomass (AGB) of woody vegetation in fallow systems. Next, using a subset of 58 plots in fallow fields aged 5 to 10 years, we used confirmatory path analysis to explore the relations between management history, soil, vegetation properties and biomass productivity. The sampled fallow fields had, on average, 58.4(+/- 46.2) Mg ha(-1) AGB. AGB was positively related to both fallow age and to the proportion of remnant trees in AGB and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles. Biomass productivity varied with the number of previous slash-and-burn cycles, with notable declines in the fourth cycle. The effect of management history was mainly through a reduction in the dominance of fast growing tree species and in the number of regenerating stems, which were also indirectly affected by an increase in C. odorata cover. Soil fertility status and the biomass of remnant trees also modified biomass productivity. Our findings suggest that under the current management intensity the capacity of the slash and burn system to provide important ecosystem functions, such as carbon sequestration, is declining.

In the context of managing forests for climate change mitigation/adaptation, maximizing and/or maintaining aboveground biomass will require understanding the interactions between tree biodiversity, site productivity, and the stocking of live trees. Species richness may not be the most appropriate tree biodiversity metric in this context as it weights all species as equally important. Measures that account for evolutionary relationships among species should be more biologically meaningful surrogates of functional diversity within forest communities, given that more phylogenetically distinct species should contribute more to the diversity of traits within a community. Using data from approximately 79,000 permanent and standardized forest inventory plots across the United States, we assessed trends in live aboveground tree biomass (LAGB) in relation to metrics of forest tree biodiversity at national and regional scales, controlling for site productivity and live tree stocking. These metrics included four measures of evolutionary diversity associated with distinct components of functional variation. In certain situations and locations across the U.S., evolutionary diversity metrics supply additional information about forest stands beyond that provided by simple species richness counts. This information can potentially include critical insight into tree functional attributes inherently related to evolutionary diversity. Relationships nationally between LAGS and most biodiversity metrics weakened with increasing site productivity and with increasing live tree stocking: The greater the site productivity and tree stocking, the less likely that higher biodiversity was associated with greater LAGB. This is consistent with the expectation that the coexistence of functionally different species increases forest productivity in less productive and more stressful environments, while dominant and highly productive species are able to competitively dominate in more productive habitats. Phylogenetic species clustering (PSC) was increasingly correlated with LAGB as live tree stocking increased on low-productivity sites, suggesting that the co-occurrence of tree species more widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of life, and therefore likely possessing a wider variety of functional attributes, resulted in greater biomass accumulation on poorer sites. PSC and species richness appear to be the best biodiversity predictors for LAGB on the low-productivity sites likely to be most important for carbon/biomass management. These biodiversity metrics will be important for maximizing biomass/carbon for future carbon sequestration or bioenergy needs and should serve as indicators of forest function in forest resource assessments.

The model fractionates diversity into three components, namely species richness (S), species evenness (E) and the degree of difference between species (D). The influence of each of these components is assessed individually: S is varied by changing the number of species, E by changing their population size, and D by changing the range of species trails critical to productivity (specific nutrient uptake rate, sigma(r), or nutrient use efficiency, NUE). D was quantified as the coefficient of variation of sigma(r), or NUE. All three components of diversity enhance the biomass and nutrient stocks in the community, but the response patterns are different. Species richness has a saturating influence, whereas effects of E and D are linear and exponential, respectively. In all cases the non-linear dependence of productivity and nutrient acquisition on sigma(r) and NUE during exponential growth was the single mechanism underlying these effects. This causes the presence of plants with extreme traits to promote productivity, and S, E and D all affect the abundance and/or intensity of these extremes. The model offers a framework to explain differences between experimental observations, and suggests a concept of diversity where S and E are structural components and D a qualitative or functional component, which modulates the influence of the two others. We propose to explicitly recognise D as an integral constituent of plant diversity in future studies.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Nijs, I (autor correspondente), Univ Antwerp, Lab Plant Ecol, Dept Biol, Univ Splein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.",,,"Nijs, Ivan/0000-0003-3111-680X",,,,NA,34,76,80,1,43,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2000,88,1,,,,NA,57,66,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880107.x,0,NA,,10,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,286BW,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000085424600007,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is evidence on the mode of nitrogen (N) and drought (D) effects on tree growth, our understanding of the interplay of these factors is still limited. Simultaneously, as mixtures are expected to be less sensitive to global change as compared to monocultures, we aimed to investigate the combined effects of N addition and D on the productivity of three tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Pseudotsuga menziesii) in relation to functional diverse species mixtures using data from a 4-year field experiment in Northwest Germany. Here we show that species mixing can mitigate the negative effects of combined N fertilization and D events, but the community response is mainly driven by the combination of certain traits rather than the tree species richness of a community. For beech, we found that negative effects of D on growth rates were amplified by N fertilization (i.e., combined treatment effects were non-additive), while for oak and fir, the simultaneous effects of N and D were additive. Beech and oak were identified as most sensitive to combined N D effects with a strong size-dependency observed for beech, suggesting that the negative impact of N+D becomes stronger with time as beech grows larger. As a consequence, the net biodiversity effect declined at the community level, which can be mainly assigned to a distinct loss of complementarity in beech-oak mixtures. This pattern, however, was not evident in the other species-mixtures, indicating that neighborhood composition (i.e., trait combination), but not tree species richness mediated the relationship between tree diversity and treatment effects on tree growth. Our findings point to the importance of the qualitative role ('trait portfolio') that biodiversity play in determining resistance of diverse tree communities to environmental changes. As such, they provide further understanding for adaptive management strategies in the context of global change.","[Dziedek, Christoph; Haerdtle, Werner; Fichtner, Andreas] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Tharandt, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Fichtner, A (autor correspondente), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany.",fichtner@leuphana.de,"von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015; Fichtner, Andreas/AAP-3188-2021","von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Fichtner, Andreas/0000-0003-0499-4893; Hardtle, Werner/0000-0002-5599-5792","Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, Bonn","Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, Bonn","The study was supported by the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, Bonn.",NA,76,23,25,5,102,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

We established a field experiment to test whether cultivars and local ecotypes of dominant prairie grasses were genetically distinct and differentially influenced ecosystem functioning. Whole plots were assigned to cultivar and local ecotype grass sources. Three subplots within each whole plot were seeded to unique pools of subordinate species. The cultivar of the increasingly dominant grass, Sorghastrum nutans, was genetically different than the local ecotype, but genetic diversity was similar between the two sources. There were no differences in aboveground net primary production, soil carbon accrual, and net nitrogen mineralization rate in soil between the grass sources. Comparable productivity of the grass sources among the species pools for four years shows functional equivalence in terms of biomass production. Subordinate species comprised over half the aboveground productivity, which may have diluted the potential for documented trait differences between the grass sources to influence ecosystem processes. Regionally developed cultivars may be a suitable alternative to local ecotypes for restoration in fragmented landscapes with limited gene flow between natural and restored prairie and negligible recruitment by seed.","[Baer, Sara G.; Gibson, David J.; Benscoter, Allison M.; Reed, Lewis K.; Campbell, Ryan E.; Klopf, Ryan P.; Willand, Jason E.; Wodika, Ben R.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Baer, Sara G.; Gibson, David J.; Benscoter, Allison M.; Reed, Lewis K.; Campbell, Ryan E.; Klopf, Ryan P.; Willand, Jason E.; Wodika, Ben R.] So Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Gustafson, Danny J.] Citadel, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Baer, SG (autor correspondente), So Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",sgbaer@siu.edu,"Gustafson, Danny J./H-7075-2019","Gibson, David/0000-0002-0308-7506",National Science Foundation [DEB 0516429]; R.O.A. supplement award; Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [0823341] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); R.O.A. supplement award; Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research program; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Funding for this research was provided by a grant from the National Science Foundation (DEB 0516429) to Sara G.

We examined the effect of Fallopia japonica on two native grassland species (Trifolium repens, Lolium perenne). We hypothesized that its negative effects on the native species are dependent on three mechanisms: (i) allelochemicals released and accumulated in soil with a history of invasion, (ii) altered soil biota and (iii) direct resource competition. We measured the response of the native species as the difference in their functional traits when grown under the three conditions. Our results demonstrate that neither allelochemicals nor soil biota from soil with history of F. japonica invasion had measurable effects on either species. Competition with the invader strongly reduced height, biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) of T. repens, while it had a lower effect on L. perenne. Furthermore, our results reveal that F. japonica took advantage of a positive plant-soil and plantplant interaction. The results show that the prominent mechanism underpinning the invasion success of F. japonica in the grassland was the direct resource competition. This prominent role is also confirmed by the significant interactions between competition, allelochemicals and soil biota from soils with history of invasion of F. japonica on SLA of the native species.","[Mincheva, T.; Barni, E.; Siniscalco, C.] Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Viale Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Mincheva, T (autor correspondente), Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Viale Mattioli 25, I-10125 Turin, Italy.",tsvetana.mincheva@unito.it,"Barni, Elena/C-7096-2012","Barni, Elena/0000-0001-7256-0064","Ministry of Education, University and Research, Italy","Ministry of Education, University and Research, Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This work was supported by a PhD fellowship from the Ministry of Education, University and Research, Italy.",NA,57,7,8,8,76,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1126-3504,1724-5575,,PLANT BIOSYST,Plant Biosyst.,,2016,150,6,,,,NA,1348,1357,,10.1080/11263504.2015.1115437,0,NA,,10,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,EC3CL,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000388002200024,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drivers are a trigger for biodiversity loss and undermine the ecosystems services like carbon storage. Here our goal was to analyze how these drivers can affect the structure and dynamics of the savanna's tree species and how they impact the savanna's total estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). We analysed eight sites that comprise a physiognomic gradient from open savanna to savanna woodland. The species were classified by three traits: phenological strategies (deciduous or evergreen), fire resistance (resprouting or non-resprouting), and dispersal syndrome (animal or non-animal). Then, we modelled AGB loss in a dry season in the austral winter, a 2 degrees C increase in daily temperature, five fire events by decadal-series, and a defaunation scenario. Although climate change, change in fire frequency, and defaunation effects impact AGB separately, they also have a synergistic effect. This effect was observed in functional strategies and also in the total AGB of the community. In some cases, the total AGB loss exceeded 70%. The negative effects on performance were highest in species which were decidual, non-resprouting, and which employed animal dispersal for their seed. If different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future, savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen, resprouters, and non-animal dispersed species, representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and ecosystem functions.","[Maciel, Everton A.; Martins, Valeria F.; Giles, Andre; Martins, Fernando R.] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biol, Dept Plant Biol, POB 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Martins, Valeria F.] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Ctr Agr Sci, Dept Nat Sci Maths & Educ, Rodovia Anhanguera SP 330,Km 174, BR-13600970 Araras, SP, Brazil; [de Paula, Mateus D.; Huth, Andreas; Fischer, Rico] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [de Paula, Mateus D.] SBiK F Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Georg Voigt Str 14-16, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Guilherme, Frederico A.

We hypothesize that, in the time between these periods, extinction of local plant species and addition of exotic plants modified phylogenetic-alpha-diversity at different levels (deeper and terminal phylogeny) and increased phylo-beta-diversity among islands. Based on floristic studies, we assembled a phylogenetic tree from occurrence data that includes 921 species, of which 165 and 756 were native or exotic in origin, respectively. Then, we studied change in the phylo-alpha-diversity and phylo-beta-diversity (1-Phylosor) by comparing pre-European and current times. Despite extinction of 18 native angiosperm species, an increase in species richness and phylo-adiversity was observed for all islands studied, attributed to introduction of exotic plants (between 6 to 477 species per island). We did not observe significant variation of mean phylogenetic distance (MPD), a measure of the 'deeper' phylogenetic diversity of assemblages (e.g., orders, families), suggesting that neither extinctions nor introductions altered phylogenetic structure of the angiosperms of these islands. In regard to phylo-beta-diversity, we detected temporal turnover (variation in phylogenetic composition) between periods to flora (0.38 +/- 0.11). However, when analyses were performed only considering native plants, we did not observe significant temporal turnover between periods (0.07 +/- 0.06). These results indicate that introduction of exotic angiosperms has contributed more notably than extinctions to the configuration of plant assemblages and phylogenetic diversity on the studied islands. Because phylogenetic diversity is closely related to functional diversity (species trait variations and roles performed by organisms), our results suggests that the introduction of exotic plants to these islands could have detrimental impacts for ecosystem functions and ecosystem services that islands provide (e.g. productivity).","[Carvallo, Gaston O.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Castro, Sergio A.] Univ Santiago, Fac Quim & Biol, Lab Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile; [Castro, Sergio A.] Ctr Desarrollo Nanociencia & Nanotecnol CEDENNA, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Carvallo, GO (autor correspondente), Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile.",gaston.carvallo@pucv.cl,,,FONDECYT [11150301]; Center for the Development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology [CEDENNA FB0807]; Proyecto Basal USA [1555.48],FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Center for the Development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL); Proyecto Basal USA(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL),"FONDECYT 11150301 supported GOC.

We then tested the efficacy of the groupings by assessing biomass and nitrogen accumulation Functions of each species in two greenhouse experiments that differed in soil moisture and nutrient availability. Plants were grown for 6 mo in both monotypic and multispecies microcosms. Functional attributes differed among species, including members of the a priori groups. We found a 2-fold range in tissue nitrogen concentrations and a 2.5-fold range in biomass accumulation. Rhizosphere root distributions differed, and root-to-shoot ratios ranged 3-fold. The presence of neigh boring species altered the biomass or nitrogen concentrations of four species. A posteriori cluster analysis based on microcosm performance produced different species groups than found in the a priori analysis. Two species pairs appeared functionally redundant, although the annual and perennial pair would likely differentiate in time, and species in the second pair tend to be found at different elevations across the marsh plain. We argue that the designation of functional groups should be based on measured performance and objective classification procedures. Rather than assuming functional redundancy, we recommend testing for similarity of group members under Varied conditions, e.g., alone and with their common neighbors and under benign and stressful conditions.","San Diego State Univ, Pacific Estuarine Res Lab, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Sullivan, G (autor correspondente), San Diego State Univ, Pacific Estuarine Res Lab, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",sullivan@perl.sdsu.edu,,,,,,NA,84,23,24,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1999,84,2,,,,NA,246,260,,10.2307/3546719,0,NA,,15,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,169VG,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000078769300008,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invaded soils appear to differ from surrounding soils in ways that impede restoration of diverse native plant communities. We hypothesize that invader-mediated shifts in edaphic properties reproducibly alter soil microbial community structure and function. Here, we take a holistic approach, characterizing plant, prokaryotic, and fungal communities and soil physicochemical properties in field sites, invasion gradients, and experimental plots for three invasive plant species that cooccur in the Rocky Mountain West. Each invader had a unique impact on soil physicochemical properties. We found that invasions drove shifts in the abundances of specific microbial taxa, while overall belowground community structure and functional potential were fairly constant. Forb invaders were generally enriched in copiotrophic bacteria with higher 16S rRNA gene copy numbers and showed greater microbial carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolic potential. Older invasions had stronger effects on abiotic soil properties, indicative of multiyear successions. Overall, we show that plant invasions are idiosyncratic in their impact on soils and are directly responsible for driving reproducible shifts in the soil environment over multiyear time scales. IMPORTANCE In this study, we show how invasive plant species drive rapid shifts in the soil environment from surrounding native communities. Each of the three plant invaders had different but consistent effects on soils. Thus, there does not appear to be a one-size-fits-all strategy for how plant invaders alter grassland soil environments. This work represents a crucial step toward understanding how invaders might be able to prevent or impair native reestablishment by changing soil biotic and abiotic properties.","[Gibbons, Sean M.; Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.; Sangwan, Naseer; Gilbert, Jack A.] Argonne Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Microbiome Ctr, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.; Lekberg, Ylva; Mummey, Daniel L.; Ramsey, Philip W.] MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Gibbons, Sean M.] MIT, Dept Biol Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Lekberg, Ylva] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Surg, Microbiome Ctr, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Gilbert, Jack A.] Marine Biol Lab, Microbiome Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Chicago; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole,"Gibbons, SM (autor correspondente), Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Gibbons, SM (autor correspondente), Argonne Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Microbiome Ctr, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.;Gibbons, SM (autor correspondente), MPG Ranch, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.;Gibbons, SM (autor correspondente), MIT, Dept Biol Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sgibbons@mit.edu,"Gibbons, Sean M./ABH-2562-2020; Gilbert, Jack/AAF-3270-2019","Gibbons, Sean M./0000-0002-8724-7916; Lekberg, Ylva/0000-0003-1033-8032; Sangwan, Naseer/0000-0002-2407-769X",EPA STAR Graduate Fellowship; National Institutes of Health [5T-32EB-009412]; MPG Ranch; DOE [DE-AC02-06CH11357],EPA STAR Graduate Fellowship(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); MPG Ranch; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),Sean Gibbons was supported by an EPA STAR Graduate Fellowship and National Institutes of Health training grant 5T-32EB-009412.

Further, understanding how and where to undertake restoration to achieve carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation would provide an opportunity to finance ecosystem restoration under carbon markets. We surveyed 30 native mixed-species plantings in subtropical forests and woodlands in Australia and used structural equation modeling to determine vegetation, soil, and climate variables most likely driving aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness and investigate the relationships between plant diversity, aboveground biomass accrual, and bird diversity. We focussed on woodland and forest-dependent birds, and functional groups at risk of decline (insectivorous, understorey-nesting, and small-bodied birds). We found that mean moisture availability strongly limits aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness in restoration plantings, indicating potential synergies in choosing sites for carbon and biodiversity purposes. Counter to theory, woody plant richness was a poor direct predictor of aboveground biomass accrual, but was indirectly related via significant, positive effects of stand density. We also found no direct relationship between aboveground biomass accrual and bird richness, likely because of the strong effects of moisture availability on both variables. Instead, moisture availability and patch size strongly and positively influenced the richness of woodland and forest-dependent birds. For understorey-nesting birds, however, shrub cover and patch size predicted richness. Stand age or area of native vegetation surrounding the patch did not influence bird richness. Our results suggest that in subtropical biomes, planting larger patches to higher densities, ideally using a diversity of trees and shrubs (characteristics of ecological plantings) in more mesic locations will enhance the provision of carbon and biodiversity cobenefits. Further, ecological plantings will aid the rapid recovery of woodland and forest bird richness, with comparable aboveground biomass accrual to less diverse forestry plantations.","[Hagger, Valerie; Dwyer, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Wilson, Kerrie] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Future Environm, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [England, Jacqueline R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Hagger, V (autor correspondente), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",v.hagger@uq.edu.au,"England, Jacqueline R/G-6417-2011; Wilson, Kerrie/W-4181-2019; Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Hagger, Valerie/G-1773-2014","England, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-3371-1509; Wilson, Kerrie/0000-0002-0092-935X; Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; Hagger, Valerie/0000-0001-8408-8449",Ecological Society of Australia Holsworth Research Endowment; CSIRO Integrated Natural Resource Management scholarship,Ecological Society of Australia Holsworth Research Endowment; CSIRO Integrated Natural Resource Management scholarship,Ecological Society of Australia Holsworth Research Endowment; CSIRO Integrated Natural Resource Management scholarship,NA,97,4,4,8,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In the attempt to reconcile these apparently inconsistent results, we explored whether the strength and shape of AWP-diversity relationships shifts along spatial and temporal environmental gradients in forests across Europe. We used tree ring data from a network of permanent forest plots distributed at six sites across Europe to estimate annual AWP over a 15-year period (1997-2011). We then tested whether the relationship between tree species richness and AWP changes (i) across sites as a function of large-scale gradients in climatic productivity and tree packing density and (ii) among years within each sites as a result of fluctuating climatic conditions. AWP-species richness relationships varied markedly among sites. As predicted by theory, the relationship shifted from strongly positive at sites where climate imposed a strong limitation on wood production and tree packing densities were low, to weakly negative at sites where climatic conditions for growth were most suitable. In contrast, we found no consistent effect of interannual fluctuations in climate on the strength of AWP-species richness relationships within sites.Synthesis. Our results indicate that the shape and strength of the relationship between tree diversity and forest productivity depends critically on environmental context. Across Europe, tree diversity shows the greatest potential to positively influence forest productivity at either end of the latitudinal gradient, where adverse climatic conditions limit productivity and lead to the development of less densely packed stands.","[Jucker, Tommaso; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Avacaritei, Daniel; Barnoaiea, Ionut; Duduman, Gabriel; Bouriaud, Olivier] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Forestry Fac, 13 Str Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania",University of Cambridge; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Jucker, T (autor correspondente), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.",tj272@cam.ac.uk,"Bouriaud, Olivier/GQI-3650-2022; Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011; Daniel, Avacaritei/E-9101-2019","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X; Daniel, Avacaritei/0000-0002-7680-7017; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582; Duduman, Gabriel/0000-0002-6936-5791; Barnoaiea, Ionut/0000-0002-0327-4336",European Union [265171],European Union(European Commission),"We thank FunDivEUROPE site managers and field technicians for establishing the permanent plots, and are grateful to I.

Decreased diversity reduces the strength of the portfolio effect, a mechanism stabilizing community temporal fluctuations. Community stability is also expected to decrease with greater variability in individual species populations and with synchrony of their fluctuations. In semi-natural meadows, eutrophication is one of the most important drivers of diversity decline; it is expected to increase species fluctuations and synchrony among them, all effects leading to lower community stability. With a 16-year time series of biomass data from a temperate species-rich meadow with fertilization and removal of the dominant species, we assessed population biomass temporal (co)variation under different management types and competition intensity, and in relation to species functional traits and to species diversity. Whereas the effect of dominant removal was relatively small (with a tendency toward lower stability), fertilization markedly decreased community stability (i.e., increased coefficient of variation in the total biomass) and species diversity. On average, the fluctuations of individual populations were mutually independent, with a slight tendency toward synchrony in unfertilized plots, and a tendency toward compensatory dynamics in fertilized plots and no effects of removal. The marked decrease of synchrony with fertilization, contrary to the majority of the results reported previously, follows the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Synchrony increased also with species functional similarity stressing the importance of shared ecological strategies in driving similar species responses to weather fluctuations. As expected, the decrease of temporal stability of total biomass was mainly related to the decrease of species richness, with its effect remaining significant also after accounting for fertilization. The weakening of the portfolio effect with species richness decline is a crucial driver of community destabilization. However, the positive effect of species richness on temporal stability of total biomass was not due to increased compensatory dynamics, since synchrony increased with species richness. This shows that the negative effect of eutrophication on community stability does not operate through increasing synchrony, but through the reduction of diversity.","[Leps, Jan; Majekova, Maria; Vitova, Alena; Dolezal, Jiri; de Bello, Francesco] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Majekova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Dept Soil Sci, Fac Nat Sci, SK-84215 Bratislava, Slovakia; [Dolezal, Jiri; de Bello, Francesco] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Comenius University Bratislava; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Leps, J (autor correspondente), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.;Leps, J (autor correspondente), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",suspa@prf.jcu.cz,"Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022","Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051",GACR [17-05506S],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This research was supported by GACR 17-05506S.

However, in recent decades, most ecologists have primarily focused on species diversity while paying little attention to functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity (PD), especially in alpine meadow communities following fertilization. In this study, a fertilization experiment involving the addition of nitrogen, phosphorus, and a mixture of both was implemented in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Species diversity, functional diversity, and PD were measured, and the responses of these parameters to the variation in productivity were analyzed. We found that the productivity of alpine plant communities was colimited by N and P, with N being the principal and P being the secondary limiting nutrient. Our results supported the prediction of both the mass ratio hypothesis and niche complementarity hypothesis in fertilized communities, but these hypotheses were not mutually exclusive. The combination of different aspects of biodiversity not only provides a crucial tool to explain the variation in productivity and to understand the underlying mechanisms but also plays an important role in predicting the variation in productivity of -alpine meadow communities, which are sensitive to nutrient enrichment in the context of global change.","[Zhou, Xiaolong; Guo, Zhi; Zhang, Pengfei; Li, Honglin; Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolong] Xinjiang Univ, Inst Arid Ecol & Environm, Urumqi, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, SYSU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Conservat, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xilai] Qinghai Univ, Coll Agr & Anim Husb, Xining, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Xinjiang University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Qinghai University,"Du, GZ (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",guozdu@lzu.edu.cn,"Chu, Chu/T-6038-2019","Chu, Chengjin/0000-0002-0606-449X; zhou, xiaolong/0000-0001-6412-2232; Zhang, Pengfei/0000-0001-7959-9092",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41430749],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41430749",NA,93,18,20,19,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the drivers of net forest biomass change (i.e. net carbon sequestration) are poorly understood. Here, we evaluate how abiotic factors (soil conditions and disturbance) and biotic factors (forest structure, diversity and community trait composition) shape three important demographic processes (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) and how these underlie net biomass change. 2. To test this, we evaluated 9 years of biomass dynamics using 48 1-ha plots in a Bolivian tropical moist forest, and measured for the most abundant species eight functional traits that are important for plant carbon gain and loss. Demographic processes were related to the abiotic and biotic factors using structural equation models. 3. Variation in net biomass change across plots was mostly due to stand-level mortality, but mortality itself could not be predicted at this scale. Contrary to expectations, we found that species richness and trait composition - which is an indicator for the mass-ratio theory - had little effect on the demographic processes. Biomass recruitment (i.e. the biomass growth by recruiting trees) increased with higher resource availability (i.e. water and light) and with high species richness, probably because of increased resource use efficiency. Biomass growth of larger, established trees increased with higher sand content, which may facilitate root growth of larger trees to deeper soil layers. 4. In sum, diversity and mass-ratio are of limited importance for the productivity of this forest. Instead, in this moist tropical forest with a marked dry season, demographic processes are most strongly determined by soil texture, soil water availability and forest structure. Only by simultaneously evaluating multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of demographic processes, better insights can be gained into mechanisms playing a role in the carbon sequestration potential of tropical forests and natural systems in general.","[van der Sande, Masha T.; Pena-Claros, Marielos; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van der Sande, Masha T.; Arets, Eric J.

Climate change is expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme drought in most grassland ecosystems. Exploring the responses of below-ground bud banks and their relationships with above-ground plant structure and drought is need to explain how climate change will impact grassland ecosystems. However, studies on the response of community-scale bud and shoot densities to experimental drought along an aridity gradient are rare.2. We experimentally removed 66% of growing season precipitation for 4 years in three temperate grasslands that spanned an aridity gradient in northern China. We quantified the legacy effects of drought on grass, forb and total community below-ground bud density, above-ground shoot density and the ratio of bud to shoot density 1 year following treatment.3. Below-ground bud density was lowest at the highest aridity site for the entire community, while above-ground shoot density was highest at the medium aridity site. Below-ground bud and above-ground shoot densities were the lowest at the high aridity site for grasses but the highest for forbs at this site. Bud:shoot ratios decreased with increasing aridity for grasses, yet remained constant for forbs along the aridity gradient. Below-ground bud density in drought plots remained lower than controls a year following drought at each site. Experimental drought did not alter the below-ground bud bank for grasses but decreased forb bud banks across sites. Experimental drought had little legacy effects on above-ground shoot density and bud:shoot ratios for grasses, forbs and the total community at each site.4. Our results suggest that grass and forb bud banks can differ in their responses to both multi-year drought along an aridity gradient, and that bud limitation for shoot generation may increase as grasslands get drier. Bud bank responses to climate will impact plant community functioning and resilience. Thus, incorporating bud bank dynamics will improve projections of grassland ecosystems under future climate change.","[Qian, Jianqiang; Zhang, Zhiming; Dong, Yawei] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Ma, Qun; Han, Xingguo; Luo, Wentao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Ma, Qun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Grassland Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jinlei] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landscape & Plant Ecol, Stuttgart, Germany; [Zuo, Xiaoan] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Urat Desert Grassland Res Stn, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Broderick, Caitlin M.

Location France. Time period 1992-2012. Major taxa studied Stream fishes. Methods We analysed the relationship between biodiversity (species richness and functional diversity) and fish community biomass at 1,357 stream sites distributed throughout France. We used piecewise path analysis to quantify effects of abiotic and biodiversity variables on biomass and assess relative contributions of native and non-native species on the diversity-biomass relationship. Results Biodiversity showed a direct positive relationship with biomass after controlling for sampling effort, and direct effects of biodiversity variables on community biomass exceeded those of climate and physical habitat variables. Our analysis indicates that positive effects of species richness on biomass exceeded those of functional diversity. Indirect effects of abiotic variables mediated by biodiversity metrics indicated that biomass increased in warmer, lowland habitats. Human impact had no effect on native biodiversity but had a positive effect on non-native biodiversity. Main conclusions We provide evidence that direct effects of biodiversity on community biomass outweigh those of abiotic variables in riverine fish communities, but resource partitioning alone is unlikely to drive the effects of biodiversity on biomass in this system. Quantification of the relative roles of anthropogenic impacts, biodiversity and environmental context in the regulation of ecosystem functioning will be necessary to understand the potential consequences of ongoing global change.","[Woods, Taylor; Comte, Lise; Giam, Xingli] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Tedesco, Pablo A.] Univ Paul Sabatier, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, CNRS, Toulouse, France",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Woods, T (autor correspondente), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",woodstaylorelizabeth@gmail.com,"Comte, Lise/AAS-5036-2021; Tedesco, Pablo A/F-7088-2013","Comte, Lise/0000-0001-8030-0019; Tedesco, Pablo A/0000-0001-5972-5928; Woods, Taylor/0000-0002-6277-1260","University of Tennessee; Evolution & Diversite Biologique Laboratory through the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) project CEBA [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-10LABX-25-01]; Evolution & Diversite Biologique Laboratory through the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) project TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41, ANR-10LABX-25-01]",University of Tennessee; Evolution & Diversite Biologique Laboratory through the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) project CEBA; Evolution & Diversite Biologique Laboratory through the Laboratoire d'Excellence (LABEX) project TULIP,"T.W., L.C. and X.G. received funding through the University of Tennessee.

However, most PSF research has measured monoculture growth in greenhouse conditions. Translating PSFs into effects on plant growth in field communities remains an important frontier for PSF research. Using a 4-year, factorial field experiment in Jena, Germany, we measured the growth of nine grassland species on soils conditioned by each of the target species (i.e., 72 PSFs). Plant community models were parameterized with or without these PSF effects, and model predictions were compared to plant biomass production in diversity-productivity experiments. Plants created soils that changed subsequent plant biomass by 40%. However, because they were both positive and negative, the average PSF effect was 14% less growth on home than on away soils. Nine-species plant communities produced 29 to 37% more biomass for polycultures than for monocultures due primarily to selection effects. With or without PSF, plant community models predicted 28%-29% more biomass for polycultures than for monocultures, again due primarily to selection effects. Synthesis: Despite causing 40% changes in plant biomass, PSFs had little effect on model predictions of plant community biomass across a range of species richness. While somewhat surprising, a lack of a PSF effect was appropriate in this site because species richness effects in this study were caused by selection effects and not complementarity effects (PSFs are a complementarity mechanism). Our plant community models helped us describe several reasons that even large PSF may not affect plant productivity. Notably, we found that dominant species demonstrated small PSF, suggesting there may be selective pressure for plants to create neutral PSF. Broadly, testing PSFs in plant communities in field conditions provided a more realistic understanding of how PSFs affect plant growth in communities in the context of other species traits.","[Grenzer, Josephine; Kulmatiski, Andrew; Forero, Leslie] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Grenzer, Josephine; Kulmatiski, Andrew; Forero, Leslie] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ebeling, Anne] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Jena, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Norton, Jeanette] Utah State Univ, Dept Plant Soils & Climate, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Leipzig University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Kulmatiski, A (autor correspondente), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;Kulmatiski, A (autor correspondente), Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",andrew.kulmatiski@usu.edu,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; kulmatiski, andrew/J-2072-2015","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; kulmatiski, andrew/0000-0001-9977-5508; Forero, Leslie/0000-0002-9577-8725",United States National Science Foundation [1354129]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station [9433],United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,"United States National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1354129; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Grant/Award Number: 9433",NA,72,1,1,8,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, the effects of diversity on demographic responses to the environment are poorly understood. We tested the diversity hypothesis (measured through functional diversity) and the mass ratio hypothesis (measured through functional identity) in relation to tree growth, tree mortality and sapling abundance. We sought to determine whether functional diversity underlies demographic responses to environmental variation in European forests. LocationEurope (Spain, Germany, Wallonia, Finland and Sweden). MethodsWe used data from five European national forest inventories from boreal to Mediterranean biomes (c. 700,000 trees in 54,000 plots and 143 tree species) and the main forest types across Europe (i.e. from needle-leaved evergreen forests to broad-leaved deciduous forests). For each forest type, we applied maximum likelihood techniques to quantify the relative importance of stand structure, climate and diversity (i.e. functional diversity and functional identity) as determinants of growth, mortality and sapling abundance. We also tested whether demographic responses to environmental conditions (including stand density, evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies) varied with functional diversity. ResultsOur results suggest that functional diversity has a positive effect on sapling abundance and growth rates in forests across Europe, while no effect was observed on tree mortality. Functional identity has a strong effect on mortality and sapling abundance, with greater mortality rates in forests dominated by needle-leaved individuals and a greater abundance of saplings in forests dominated by broad-leaved individuals. Furthermore, we observed that functional diversity modified the effects of stand density on demographic responses in Mediterranean forests and the influence of evapotranspiration and temperature anomalies in forests widely distributed across Europe. Main conclusionOur results suggest that functional diversity may play a key role in forest dynamics through complementarity mechanisms, as well as by modulating demographic responses to environmental variation.","[Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Jump, Alistair S.] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Ruiz-Benito, Paloma; Madrigal-Gonzalez, Jaime; Zavala, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Ciencias Vida, Grp Ecol & Restaurac Forestal, Edificio Ciencias,Campus Univ, Madrid 28805, Spain; [Ratcliffe, Sophia; Wirth, Christian] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Johannisallee 21-23, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Jump, Alistair S.] CREAF, Campus Bellaterra UAB Edifici C, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena] CSIC, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol Sevilla IRNAS, POB 1052, Seville 41080, Spain; [Wirth, Christian] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch 15 Pl 5E, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Kaendler, Gerald] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; [Lehtonen, Aleksi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Jokiniemenkuja 1, FI-01370 Vantaa, Finland; [Dahlgren, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany",University of Stirling; Universidad de Alcala; Leipzig University; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Max Planck Society,"Ruiz-Benito, P (autor correspondente), Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",palomaruizbenito@gmail.com,"Madrigal-González, Jaime/B-1883-2017; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/E-5833-2012; Gómez-Aparicio, Lorena/K-6905-2014; Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016; Wirth, Christian/A-4446-2016; Zavala, Miguel A./H-3603-2015","Madrigal-González, Jaime/0000-0002-9522-5493; Ruiz-Benito, Paloma/0000-0002-2781-5870; Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469; Zavala, Miguel A./0000-0003-1456-0132; Ratcliffe, Sophia/0000-0001-9284-7900; Lehtonen, Aleksi/0000-0003-1388-0388; Jump, Alistair/0000-0002-2167-6451","European Union [265171, PCOFUND-GA-2010-267243]; Leverhulme Trust [IN-2013-004]; University of Stirling; MINECO [CGL2015-69186-C2-2-R]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; iDiv",European Union(European Commission); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); University of Stirling; MINECO(Spanish Government); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS; iDiv,"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement nos 265171 (FunDivEUROPE) and PCOFUND-GA-2010-267243 (Plant Fellows), The Leverhulme Trust (no.

We obtained multiple overyielding values by comparing productivity in a five-species mixture to expected values from its component monocultures at a) six levels of nitrogen addition (spanning 0-500 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and b) across four seasons. We also measured light, water, and nitrogen use, resource-use efficiency, and three functional traits-leaf nitrogen content, specific leaf area, and leaf area ratio-n mixtures and monocultures. We found strong evidence for non-transgressive overyielding. This was strongest in spring, with mixture productivity exceeding expected values by 20 kg dry matter ha(-1) day(-1). Peak overyielding was driven by enhanced complementarity, with the two non-N-2-fixing forb species far exceeding expected productivity in mixtures. Peak overyielding also coincided with higher water use in the mixture than for any monoculture, and enhanced mixture-resource-use efficiency. There was only weak evidence that trait plasticity influenced overyielding or resource use. Our findings suggest that when complementarity drives overyielding in grassland mixtures, and this is made possible both by increased water use and enhanced efficiency in water, nitrogen, and light use. Our results also suggest that mixtures offer a viable compromise between productivity, resource-use efficiency, and reduced environmental impacts (i.e., nitrate leaching) from intensive agriculture.","[Mason, Norman W.

This process typically involves invasion by coarse tall grasses, mostly with competitive stress-tolerant strategies, and rapid development of mono-dominance stands. A key species in this respect is Brachypodium genuense (DC.) Roem. et Schult., an endemic, rhizomatous, tall-grass that grows in the semi-natural grasslands of the Italian peninsula over 1200-1400 m a.s.l. We hypothesized that B. genuense was able to spread and dominate the grassland communities subjected to a wide range of environmental conditions through its broad spectrum of performances. In fact, it has considerable morphological variability, mirrored by high variations of traits, namely Specific Leaf Area (SLA), individual height, and tussock cover values. The study area encompassed the Monti Sibillini National Park (central Italy). We found that in more productive conditions (deeper soil, medium/high pH values, north-facing slopes, and conservative landforms) populations of B. genuense had higher SLA, plant height and cover values than in low productive conditions (south-facing slopes, shallow soils, lower pH values). This indicates a fast-growing strategy based on a high rate of resource acquisition and use, as well as high competitive ability for aboveground resources such as light under productive conditions. Under unproductive and/or dry conditions decreased SLA, plant height and cover value indicate a slow growing strategy with high conservation and low rate of resource acquisition. In addition, we found that a very high amount of nitrogen in the soil might have a detrimental effect on B. genuense individuals, decreasing the SLA values, thus requiring the plant to change its growth strategy. Finally, we inferred that the observed variability in SLA might have a paramount role in the invasive/dominant behavior of Brachypodium genuense. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

To increase complementarity in resource use, each of the four species in the experimental design represented a distinct functional type derived from two levels of each of two functional traits, nitrogen acquisition (N2-fixing legume or nonfixing grass) crossed with temporal development (fast-establishing or temporally persistent). Relative abundances of the four functional types in mixtures were systematically varied at sowing to vary the evenness of the same four species in mixture communities at each site and sown at two levels of seed density. Across multiple years, the total yield (including weed biomass) of the mixtures exceeded that of the average monoculture in >97% of comparisons. It also exceeded that of the best monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in about 60% of sites, with a mean yield ratio of mixture to best-performing monoculture of 1 center dot 07 across all sites. Analyses based on yield of sown species only (excluding weed biomass) demonstrated considerably greater transgressive overyielding (significant at about 70% of sites, ratio of mixture to best-performing monoculture=1 center dot 18). Mixtures maintained a resistance to weed invasion over at least 3years. In mixtures, median values indicate <4% of weed biomass in total yield, whereas the median percentage of weeds in monocultures increased from 15% in year 1 to 32% in year 3. Within each year, there was a highly significant relationship (P<0 center dot 0001) between sward evenness and the diversity effect (excess of mixture performance over that predicted from the monoculture performances of component species). At lower evenness values, increases in community evenness resulted in an increased diversity effect, but the diversity effect was not significantly different from the maximum diversity effect across a wide range of higher evenness values. The latter indicates the robustness of the diversity effect to changes in species' relative abundances. Across sites with three complete years of data (24 of the 31 sites), the effect of interactions between the fast-establishing and temporal persistent trait levels of temporal development was highly significant and comparable in magnitude to effects of interactions between N2-fixing and nonfixing trait levels of nitrogen acquisition. Synthesis and applications. The design of grassland mixtures is relevant to farm-level strategies to achieve sustainable intensification. Experimental evidence indicated significant yield benefits of four species agronomic mixtures which yielded more than the highest-yielding monoculture at most sites. The results are relevant for agricultural practice and show how grassland mixtures can be designed to improve resource complementarity, increase yields and reduce weed invasion. The yield benefits were robust to considerable changes in the relative proportions of the four species, which is extremely useful for practical management of grassland swards.","[Finn, John A.] TEAGASC, Environm Res Ctr, Johnstown Castle, Wexford, Ireland; [Kirwan, Laura] Waterford Inst Technol, Waterford, Ireland; [Connolly, John] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Teresa Sebastia, M.; Llurba, Rosa] Univ Lleida, ETSEA, Dept HBJ, Lleida 25198, Spain; [Teresa Sebastia, M.; Llurba, Rosa] Ctr Tecnol Forestal Catalunya, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Helgadottir, Aslaug; Dalmannsdottir, Sigridur] Agr Univ Iceland, IS-112 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Baadshaug, Ole H.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, N-1432 As, Norway; [Belanger, Gilles] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada; [Black, Alistair] TEAGASC, Beef Res Ctr, Dunsany, Meath, Ireland; [Brophy, Caroline] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Math & Stat, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Collins, Rosemary P.; Fothergill, Michael] Aberystwyth Univ, IBERS, Aberystwyth SY23 3EE, Dyfed, Wales; [Cop, Jure] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Delgado, Ignacio] CITA DGA, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Elgersma, Anjo] Wageningen Univ, Plant Sci Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frankow-Lindberg, Bodil E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ghesquiere, An] ILVO, Plant Sci Unit, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [Golinska, Barbara; Golinski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Grassland & Nat Landscape Sci, PL-60627 Poznan, Poland; [Grieu, Philippe] Univ Toulouse, INP ENSAT, UMR AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Gustavsson, Anne-Maj] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr Res Northern Sweden, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Huguenin-Elie, Olivier; Suter, Matthias; Luescher, Andreas] Agroscope Reckenholz Tanikon Res Stn ART, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kadziuliene, Zydre] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Inst Agr, LT-58344 Akademija, Kedainiai, Lithuania; [Kurki, Paivi] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Plant Prod Res, FI-50100 Mikkeli, Finland; [Porqueddu, Claudio] CNR ISPAAM, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Thumm, Ulrich] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Crop Sci, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany","Teagasc; South East Technological University (SETU); University College Dublin; Universitat de Lleida; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Teagasc; Maynooth University; Aberystwyth University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Institute of Biological, Environmental, Rural & Sciences (IBERS); University of Ljubljana; Wageningen University & Research; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Poznan University of Life Sciences; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology & Agriculture; Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture & Forestry; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Per Il Sistema Produzione Animale In Ambiente Mediterraneo (ISPAAM-CNR); University Hohenheim","Finn, JA (autor correspondente), TEAGASC, Environm Res Ctr, Johnstown Castle, Wexford, Ireland.",john.finn@teagasc.ie,"Golinski, Piotr/U-8261-2018; Golinski, Piotr/O-1719-2019; Lüscher, Andreas/E-2944-2018; Sebastia, M.

These findings may be especially significant for understanding biodiversity-stability relationships in species-poor ecosystems that have little functional redundancy among primary producers. We tested the null hypothesis that black spruce and Kalmia were functional equivalents with respect to their structuring roles of subordinate vegetation and their influence on site biogeochemistry. The purpose of the study was to determine the degree to which forest cover exerts top-down control on community structure and function of Kalmia-black spruce communities. This community type dominates much of the forest understory and unforested heathlands in Atlantic Canada. We intensively studied a representative stand of Kalmia heath in Terra Nova National Park in eastern Newfoundland. Thirty-two 0.5 m x 0.5 m sample plots were randomly distributed among five transects bisecting gradients in dominance of black spruce and Kalmia. Light levels, species composition, vascular plant cover and soil respiration rate were determined for each plot. Tissue samples of litter, mature and current year leaves of Kalmia were collected and analyzed for nutrient status. Herbaceous species richness and cover peaked at intermediate light levels. Kalmia foliar N concentration and above-ground biomass increased with increasing shade. Soil respiration rates were strongly related to the light gradient and increased with increasing quality of Kalmia litter inputs. Our data indicate that Kalmia's vigour and foliar nitrogen concentrations are greater under black spruce canopy as opposed to heath condition and that the shaded phenotype has relatively benign feedbacks on soil productivity compared to the open-habitat phenotype. In the absence of functional diversity at the species level in these species-poor habitats, phenotypic plasticity in Kalmia appears to be an important dimension of the biodiversity-stability relationship in these communities since our data suggest that this species has the potential either to inhibit or facilitate carbon cycling and the pathway is strongly linked to the presence or absence of overstory cover. The role of forest regeneration as an indirect control of forest soil processes such as carbon and nitrogen cycling in this ecosystem is discussed.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Canadian Wildlife Serv, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Lakehead University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service,"Mallik, AU (autor correspondente), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",azim.mallik@lakeheadu.ca,,,,,,NA,45,26,43,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,AUG,2004,265,1-fev.,,,,NA,279,293,,10.1007/s11104-005-0508-4,0,NA,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,884NB,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000226091200023,0,,não,,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the effects of an experimentally imposed drought on yields of monocultures and mixtures of intensively managed grassland communities comprising four species with contrasting functional traits (Lolium permute L., CichOrilmt intybus L, Trifolium repels L., Trifolium pratense L.). Complete exclusion of precipitation was implemented in a common field experiment at two sites, resulting in an experimental drought at Wexford (Ireland) and Zurich (Switzerland). In the individual harvest at the end of the drought event, very strong yield reductions (up to - 87%) occurred across all communities. In contrast, drought effects on annual yields of averaged monocultures and the equi-proportional four-species mixture were only -9% and -12%, respectively. These losses were much smaller than the yield advantage due to mixtures, which were 31% under drought and 34% under rainfed conditions. The large effect of mixtures on annual yield is attributed to complementarity among species with contrasting functional traits, and to mixture effects being active over the whole growing season and under drought. We attribute these relatively small drought effects on annual yield to the immediate recovery in harvest yields when soil water supply increased after the drought (resilience), the buffering effect of soil water at the beginning of rain exclusion, and the relatively long growing season that diluted the short-term effect of the drought event.","[Finn, J.

Little is known, however, about how to identify multispecies mixtures with optimal levels of productivity and stress resistance from the thousands of possible community configurations. Here we examine if empirical models can be used to predict highly productive community configurations of seven native grasses and legumes in controlled conditions from the very large pool of possible communities, and which basic measure of community structure best predicts function. Location: Greenhouses in Saskatchewan, Canada. Methods: We used a greenhouse experiment, where established communities varied in species and functional group richness, evenness, species and functional group identity, following a response surface design. We measured community productivity and evaluated the predictive power of a range of empirical models linking diversity and productivity. Results: Productivity increased with increased functional dispersion, relative growth rate and decreased competitive effect. Selection effects were evident, with the abundance and occurrence of particular species or functional groups and plant traits also linked to increased productivity. Among the strongest predictors of productivity were the presence and abundance of perennial C-3 grasses (particularly Pascopyrum smithii), likely because of the high early relative growth rate and strong competitive effect of those species. Conclusions: We compiled and compared the ability of a range of empirical models to predict high-productivity community configurations, and tested the accuracy of the best models in a confirmatory experiment. The relationship between predicted and observed productivity was significantly correlated in the confirmatory experiment, and demonstrates that under controlled conditions, basic measures of community structure can predict community function. This approach has potential, but variability within treatments may limit the accuracy of results. The models developed can be used as a screening tool, narrowing the search window for high functioning seed mixtures for use in ecological restoration.","[Mischkolz, Jenalee M.; Lamb, Eric G.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Schellenberg, Michael P.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Semiarid Prairie Agr Res Ctr, Swift Current, SK S9H 3X2, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Lamb, EG (autor correspondente), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Plant Sci, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",jenalee.mischkolz@usask.ca; mike.schellenberg@agr.gc.ca; eric.lamb@usask.ca,"Lamb, Eric G/D-9319-2011","Lamb, Eric G/0000-0001-5201-4541",Beef Cattle Research Council; CFI Leaders Opportunity Fund; NSERC,Beef Cattle Research Council; CFI Leaders Opportunity Fund(Canada Foundation for Innovation); NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support for this research from a Beef Cattle Research Council grant to M.

The well-known fact that the competitive ability of plant species depends on size differences among species, raises the question of effects of community species richness on small-stature subordinate species. We used experimental grasslands differing in species richness (1-60 species) and functional group richness (one to four functional groups) to study biodiversity effects on biomass production and ecophysiological traits of five small-stature herbs (Bellis perennis, Plantago media, Glechoma hederacea, Ranunculus repens and Veronica chamaedrys). We found that ecophysiological adaptations, known as typical shade-tolerance strategies, played an important role with increasing species richness and in relation to a decrease in transmitted light. Specific leaf area and leaf area ratio increased, while area-based leaf nitrogen decreased with increasing community species richness. Community species richness did not affect daily leaf carbohydrate turnover of V. chamaedrys and P. media indicating that these species maintained efficiency of photosynthesis even in low-light environments. This suggests an important possible mechanism of complementarity in such grasslands, whereby smaller species contribute to a better overall efficiency of light use. Nevertheless, these species rarely contributed a large proportion to community biomass production or achieved higher yields in mixtures than expected from monocultures. It seems likely that the allocation to aboveground plant organs to optimise carbon assimilation limited the investment in belowground organs to acquire nutrients and thus hindered these species from increasing their performance in multi-species mixtures.","[Dassler, A.; Roscher, C.; Temperton, V.

The abundance of species was compared in grazed vs. ungrazed plots (exclosures) in four neighbouring topographic sites (south- and north-facing slopes, hilltop and Wadi shoulders), representing a gradient of resource availability and productivity. 2 Above-ground potential productivity at peak standing crop in spring (i.e. inside exclosures) varied considerably between years and topographic sites. Productivity was similar among the hilltop, south- and north-facing slopes, and was typical of semi-arid ecosystems (10-200 g(-2)). Productivity in the Wadi was consistently greater (up to 700 g(-2)) and reached the range of subhumid grassland ecosystems. 3 The effect of grazing exclusion on the composition of the annual vegetation was productivity-dependent. Lower similarity (Sorenson's quantitative similarity index) between grazed and ungrazed subplots was observed in the productive Wadi compared with the less productive sites. The small-scale variation in grazing impact on species composition, due to differences in productivity, is consistent with models predicting similar trends in perennial grasslands across larger scale gradients. 4 The relationship between plant size (above-ground dry-weight), site productivity and response to fencing was analysed for the 36 most abundant annual species. Large species were more abundant in more productive sites, and small species at lower productivity, although few species were restricted to particular productivity levels. The response of individual species to protection from grazing was productivity dependent, with plant size playing a central role. Larger species tended to increase and small ones to decrease in abundance after fencing, with a mixed response in species with intermediate size. 5 A conceptual model is presented relating the response to protection from grazing along gradients of productivity to species plant size.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; Agr Res Org, Volcani Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Osem, Y (autor correspondente), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Rehovot Campus, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",osem@agri.huji.ac.il,,,,,,NA,55,114,128,5,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Nevertheless, there is paucity of data on the underlying mechanisms shaping species assemblages and species/trait diversity-productivity relationships in urban landscapes. The objectives of this study were to; 1) compile tree species diversity of different green space (GS) types, (2) describe the theoretical basis of species co-existence and 3) examine the links between species and life history trait diversity to GS and species productivity (carbon storage) in Kumasi, Ghana. Stratified sampling and species abundance models were combined in this study. About 176 tree species in 46 families were recorded within Kumasi. About 96 species were in a natural forest located towards the outskirts of the city. Home gardens, institutional compounds, and public parks had the highest species richness of 76, 75 and 71, respectively while urban rangelands and farmlands were the least species rich with 6 and 23, respectively. Species richness (S) in the peri-urban (mean ndvi >0.2, S=142) and core urban (mean ndvi<0.2, S=108) areas were significantly different (X-2 =15.7, p<0.0001, n=1). Native species richness was lowest in the core urban area and highest in the neighbouring natural forest. The geometric series model best fitted the tree assemblage of the city, depicting a species impoverished and environmentally hash landscape. Pioneers and anthropochory dispersed species were the most abundant suggesting that this urban landscape is shaped by both environment and social filters. Plant species diversity and distribution depend on the type of green space and portrays a perturbed landscape in early seres of succession with the overall ecosystem function sustained by both species and life history trait diversities.

Biodiversity has been hypothesised to be important in maintaining productivity of biological assemblages because niche complementarity and facilitation among the constituent species can result in more efficient use of resources. However, these conclusions are primarily based on studies with plant communities, and the relationship between diversity and productivity at higher trophic levels is largely unknown, especially in the marine environment. Here, we used a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of species richness and species identity on biomass accumulation in coral reef fish assemblages at Lizard Island. Small patch reefs were stocked with a total of 30 juveniles belonging to three planktivorous damselfish (genus Pomacentrus) according to three different levels of fish species richness (one, two and three species) and seven different combinations of fish species. Species richness had no effect on the relative growth in this assemblage after 18 days, but relative growth differed among individual fish species and the different combinations of species. Patterns of increase in biomass were best explained by species-specific differences and variable effects of intra- and interspecific competition on growth. These results suggest that niche complementarity and facilitation are not the most influential drivers of total productivity within this guild of planktivorous fishes. Total productivity may be resilient to declining reef fish biodiversity, but this will depend on which species are lost and on the life-history traits of remaining species.","[Messmer, Vanessa; Blowes, Shane A.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Messmer, Vanessa; Blowes, Shane A.; Jones, Geoffrey P.; Munday, Philip L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Messmer, V (autor correspondente), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",vanessa.messmer@gmail.com,"Messmer, Vanessa/B-5459-2015; Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011","Messmer, Vanessa/0000-0002-5604-6273; Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Blowes, Shane/0000-0001-6310-3670",Ian Potter Foundation Fellowship at the Australian Museum's Lizard Island Research Station; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies,Ian Potter Foundation Fellowship at the Australian Museum's Lizard Island Research Station; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council),We thank the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS) for logistical support and K.

Here we examine how their combined effects are likely to affect the diversity of future communities. We draw on several complimentary fields (community ecology, landscape genetics and biogeography) to model how climate change will alter productivity of foundation plant species and their associated communities. We focus on three issues: (i) genetic variation of foundation species influences community diversity; (ii) gene-by-environment interactions define associated communities; and (iii) relationships between productivity and species diversity follow predictable patterns. For many foundation species, responses to climate are population specific because populations are often genetically differentiated and locally adapted. Thus, biological models that examine the effects of climate change on species distribution, forest productivity, community structure or function, should incorporate population effects. Our genetics-based Universal Community Transfer Function (UCTF) provides a method to integrate climate-based population differences into community diversity models. Several major findings emerged: (i) using the UCTF, we found that genetics-based differences between populations play an important role in defining future communities. (ii) The shape of the productivity/diversity relationship (e.g. humpbacked versus linear) dramatically affects future communities making it essential to quantify this relationship. (iii) Climate change will impact the community differently at leading, continuous and rear edges of a species' distribution, but diversity at the rear edge will suffer most. Genetics-based approaches are important to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change on future communities and ecosystems. Such modelling can assist in identifying populations of foundation species of special value based on their sensitivity to climate change, future biodiversity and potential to support high biodiversity with assisted migration.","[Ikeda, Dana H.; Bothwell, Helen M.; Lau, Matthew K.; Whitham, Thomas G.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [O'Neill, Gregory A.] British Columbia Minist Forests Lands & Nat Resou, Kalamalka Forestry Ctr, Tree Improvement Branch, Vernon, BC V1B 2C7, Canada; [Grady, Kevin C.; Whitham, Thomas G.] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Grady, Kevin C.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University; Northern Arizona University,"Ikeda, DH (autor correspondente), No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",dana.ikeda@nau.edu,"Bothwell, Helen/HLP-7109-2023","Bothwell, Helen/0000-0003-0916-8355","NSF-IGERT Fellowships; NSF GK-12 Fellowship; NPS George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship; Science Foundation of Arizona Fellowship Award; Northern Arizona University Technology Research Initiative Fund (TRIF) grant; Bureau of Reclamation Grants [CESU-06FC300025, 04FC300039]; NSF FIBR grant [DEB-0425908]; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1126840] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF-IGERT Fellowships; NSF GK-12 Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NPS George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship; Science Foundation of Arizona Fellowship Award; Northern Arizona University Technology Research Initiative Fund (TRIF) grant; Bureau of Reclamation Grants; NSF FIBR grant; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This research was supported by NSF-IGERT Fellowships (DH Ikeda, HM Bothwell, MK Lau), NSF GK-12 Fellowship and NPS George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship (HM Bothwell), Science Foundation of Arizona Fellowship Award (KC Grady), Northern Arizona University Technology Research Initiative Fund (TRIF) grant (D.H.

Yet, little is known about whether and how intraspecific and inter specific FTD mediate the response of aboveground biomass to species richness across forest strata (i.e. overstorey and understorey) and at whole-community in forests. To address this question, we tested the direct and indirect responses of aboveground biomass to species richness via intraspecific and interspecific FTD based on specific leaf area (FTDSLA) and leaf dry matter content (FTDLDMC) using structural equation modeling, in addition to the effects of soil nutrients, across 125 plots in a 5-ha subtropical forest in Eastern China. Results showed that intraspecific FTD mediates the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at overstorey and under storey strata, and whole-community level, while interspecific FTD did so at understorey strata only. At over storey strata, 14% of the variation in aboveground biomass was accounted by the strong direct positive effect of species richness only. At understorey strata, soil nutrients had a strong negative direct effect followed by positive effects of species richness and FTDLDMC on aboveground biomass with 44-45% of the variation in both intraspecific and interspecific FTD models. At whole community level, 14% of the variation in aboveground biomass was explained by the strong positive direct effect of species richness followed by negative direct effect of intraspecific FTDSLA. Intraspecific and interspecific FTDLDMC had positively mediated the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at understorey strata through niche differentiation. Intraspecific FTD had negligible mediation role, whereas interspecific FTD had no role, for linking the response of aboveground biomass to species richness at overstorey strata, indicating that only dominant species with a specific functional strategy may largely determine community trait space. Intraspecific FTDSLA had negative relationship with aboveground biomass at the whole-community, probably due to the presence of a few large trees occupying larger niche space in a community. We conclude that intraspecific versus interspecific FTD plays a central role for linking the direct and indirect responses of aboveground biomass to species richness, but these relationships depend on the forest strata of a community.","[Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Tiantong Natl Forest Ecosyst Observat & Res Stn, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad; Yan, En-Rong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai Key Lab Urban Ecol Proc & Ecorestorat, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; East China Normal University; East China Normal University,"Yan, ER (autor correspondente), East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Forest Ecosyst Res & Observat Stn Putuo Isl, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",arshadforester@gmail.com; eryan@des.ecnu.edu.cn,"ER, Yan/HLX-3797-2023; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014; Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023","Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670438, 31770467]; CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CFERN & BEIJING TECHNO SOLUTIONS Award Funds on excellent academic achievements,"The authors would like to thank Min Guo, Qiang Zhong, Meng Kang, Yue Xu, Yilu Xu, Xiaodong Yang, Haixia Huang, Zhihao Zhang, Baowei Sun, Wenji Ma, Qingru Shi, Yantao, Zhao, Qingqing Zhang, Mingshan Xu, and Liuli Zhou for their assistance in the field and laboratory.

We analyzed height growth and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus browsing damage to saplings of 16 broadleaved tree species in a large-scale (13 ha) reforestation experiment in Maryland, USA, where we manipulated tree diversity in 70 1,225-m(2) plots. After four growing seasons, higher plot-level tree richness led to increased deer browsing damage (i.e., associational susceptibility). Despite increased deer damage to saplings in mixed plots, tree richness had no overall effect on sapling height growth. However, diversity-height relationships were related to species functional traits. Light demanding species with large leaves and faster growth rates had reduced heights in mixtures, whereas shade-tolerant, slower-growing species generally had either increased or unchanged height growth in diverse tree communities, likely related to increased canopy closure in mixtures relative to monocultures. We show that tree diversity can improve growth of late successional species despite exacerbated mammalian herbivore damage. By facilitating the establishment of species with a range of life-history strategies, increased tree diversity may enhance ecosystem multi-functionality in the early stages of forest restoration.","[Devaney, John L.] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll Dublin, Bot Dept, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Devaney, John L.; Pullen, Jamie; Cook-Patton, Susan C.; Burghardt, Karin T.; Parker, John D.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Cook-Patton, Susan C.] Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Burghardt, Karin T.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Trinity College Dublin; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Nature Conservancy; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Parker, JD (autor correspondente), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",parkerj@si.edu,"Burghardt, Karin/I-4776-2019; Parker, John/F-9761-2010","Burghardt, Karin/0000-0002-9302-6802; Parker, John/0000-0002-3632-7625; Devaney, John/0000-0002-7676-0378; Pullen, Jamie/0000-0001-5182-3662","NSF REU [DBI-1156799, DBI-1659668]; Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Fellowship through the James Smithson Fellowship Program; Walter Rathbone Bacon Fellowship",NSF REU(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Fellowship through the James Smithson Fellowship Program; Walter Rathbone Bacon Fellowship,"Numerous people have been instrumental in establishing and maintaining this experiment, including John Kress, Eva Pell, Tuck Hines, Whitney Hoot, Phil Bishop, David Buhrman, Alison Cawood, Caitlyn Cecil, Joe Dawson, Dejeanne Doublet, Tatiania Eaves, Andi Galvin-Manico, Andrew Hoover, Free Kashon, Lada Klimesova, Monica Knaack, Melissa McCormick, Anna Nordseth, Megan Palmer, Tyler Pullen, Dakota Robley, Sally Rohrbach, Andres Santana, Jess Shue, Charlie Tasker, Jacob Taylor, and over 100 citizen scientists.

However, the interaction effects of plant coverage and biodiversity on aboveground biomass across plant growth forms (shrubs, forbs and grasses) in natural rangelands are poorly studied. Here, we hypothesized that, while accounting for environmental factors and disturbance intensities, the positive relationships between plant coverage, biodiversity, and aboveground biomass are ubiquitous across plant growth forms in natural rangelands. We applied structural equation models (SEMs) using data from 735 quadrats across 35 study sites in semi-steppe rangelands in Iran. The combination of plant coverage and species richness rather than Shannon's diversity or species diversity (a latent variable of species richness and evenness) substantially enhance aboveground biomass across plant growth forms. In all selected SEMs, plant coverage had a strong positive direct effect on aboveground biomass (beta = 0.72 for shrubs, 0.84 for forbs and 0.80 for grasses), followed by a positive effect of species richness beta = 0.26 for shrubs, 0.05 for forbs and 0.09 for grasses), and topographic factors. Disturbance intensity had a negative effect on plant coverage, whereas it had a variable effect on species richness across plant growth forms. Plant coverage had a strong positive total effect on aboveground biomass (beta = 0.84 for shrubs, 0.88 for forbs, and 0.85 for grasses), followed by a positive effect of species richness, and a negative effect of disturbance intensity across plant growth forms. Our results shed light on the management of rangelands that is high plant coverage can significantly improve species richness and aboveground biomass across plant growth forms. We also found that high disturbance intensity due to heavy grazing has a strong negative effect on plant coverage rather than species richness in semi -steppe rangelands. This study suggests, that proper grazing systems (e.g. rotational system) based on carrying capacity and stocking rate of a rangeland may be helpful for biodiversity conservation, better grazing of livestock, improvement of plant coverage and enhancement of aboveground biomass.

Here, we review findings from TreeDivNet, a global network of 25 tree diversity experiments, on relationships between levels of biodiversity and (a) tree growth and survival and (b) damage to trees from pests and pathogens. Tree diversity often improved the survival and above- and belowground growth of young trees. The mechanistic bases of the diversity effects on tree growth and survival include both selection effects (i.e., an increasing impact of particular species in more species-rich communities) and complementary effects (e.g. related to resource differentiation and facilitation). Plant traits and abiotic stressors may mediate these relationships. Studies of the responses of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory and pathogen damage have demonstrated that trees in more diverse experimental plots may experience more, less, or similar damage compared to conspecific trees in less diverse plots. Documented mechanisms producing these patterns include changes in concentration, frequency, and apparency of hosts; herbivore and pathogen diet breadth; the spatial scale of interactions; and herbivore and pathogen regulation by natural enemies. Our review of findings from TreeDivNet indicates that tree diversity experiments are extending BEF research across systems and scales, complementing previous BEF work in grasslands by providing opportunities to use remote sensing and spectral approaches to study BEF dynamics, integrate belowground and aboveground approaches, and trace the consequences of tree physiology for ecosystem functioning. This extension of BEF research into tree-dominated systems is improving ecologists' capacity to understand the mechanistic bases behind BEF relationships. Tree diversity experiments also present opportunities for novel research. Since experimental tree diversity plantations enable measurements at tree, neighbourhood and plot level, they allow for explicit consideration of temporal and spatial scales in BEF dynamics. Presently, most TreeDivNet experiments have run for less than ten years. Given the longevity of trees, exciting results on BEF relationships are expected in the future.","[Grossman, Jake J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA;

Despite their importance, the major mechanisms in which annuals and perennials differ in the way they couple nitrogen conservation strategies to imbalances in carbon economy are not fully understood. We characterized the functional mechanism by which Physaria (Brassicaceae) species differing in life cycle adjust nitrogen use efficiency and productivity, in response to variations in carbon gain (CO2 assimilation rate). We set up a field experiment with a split-plot design with two factors: species (2 annuals and 2 perennials) and incident radiation IR (100 % of IR - control, and 35 % of IR). Reduced photosynthesis (brought about by artificial shading) resulted in lower total biomass accumulation in all species. This reduction was linked to a differential plasticity in leaf traits (specific leaf area - SLA - and nitrogen pool) between annuals and perennials, and had different consequences for nitrogen conservation. Annuals showed a decrease in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUEleaf), and nitrogen conservation was dependent on carbon economy. Annuals also had higher nitrogen loss due to higher proportion of senescent leaves, and a decrease in resorption efficiency and proficiency, relative to control plants. Perennials kept NUEleaf stable, but the strategy was species-specific: on one hand shaded P. mendocina plants had conservative leaves (non-plastic and low SLA), lower leaf senescence and higher residence time in relation to control. On the other hand, Physaria pinetorum, a short-lived perennial, combined both strategies: greater nitrogen loss due to lower resorption and proficiency, low SLA, and lower leaf senescence under lower IR. These differences in quantity and quality of leaf litter may have consequences beyond the plant's C and N economy, providing differences in functions such as soil N cycling and thus in ecosystem services.","[Rajnoch, G.; Gonzalez-Paleo, L.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Bv Almte Brown 3051, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Ravetta, D.

Taking the dataset from Chinese studies covering temperate and subtropical regions, effects of elevated ozone concentration ([O-3]) on growth, biomass, and functional leaf traits of different types of woody plants were quantitatively evaluated by meta-analysis. Elevated mean [O-3] of 116ppb reduced total biomass of woody plants by 14% compared with control (mean [O-3] of 21ppb). Temperate species from China were more sensitive to O-3 than those from Europe and North America in terms of photosynthesis and transpiration. Significant reductions in chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and ascorbate peroxidase induced significant injury to photosynthesis and growth (height and diameter). Importantly, subtropical species were significantly less sensitive to O-3 than temperate ones, whereas deciduous broadleaf species were significantly more sensitive than evergreen broadleaf and needle-leaf species. These findings suggest that carbon-sink strength of Chinese forests is reduced by present and future [O-3] relative to control (20-40ppb). Given that (sub)-tropical evergreen broadleaved species dominate in Chinese forests, estimation of the global carbon-sink constraints due to [O-3] should be re-evaluated. Tropospheric ozone is considered the most detrimental air pollutant for vegetation at a global scale, affecting the carbon-sink capacity of ecosystem and the hydrological cycle. This is the first meta-analysis including subtropical evergreen broadleaf responses to ozone. Subtropical species were significantly less sensitive to ozone than temperate ones, whereas deciduous broadleaf species were significantly more sensitive to ozone than evergreen broadleaf and needle-leaf species. The demonstration will greatly improve ozone risk assessment for trees at a global scale, suggesting that estimation of the northern hemisphere carbon-sink constraints due to ozone should be re-evaluated.","[Li, Pin; Feng, Zhaozhong; Yuan, Xiangyang; Xu, Yansen; Paoletti, Elena] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Shuangqing Rd 18, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Li, Pin; Feng, Zhaozhong; Yuan, Xiangyang; Xu, Yansen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Catalayud, Vicent] Fdn CEAM, C Charles R Darwin 14,Parque Tecnol, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Paoletti, Elena] CNR, Via Madonna del Piano 10, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR)","Feng, ZZ (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Shuangqing Rd 18, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",fzz@rcees.ac.cn,"Paoletti, Elena/AAS-5316-2021","Paoletti, Elena/0000-0001-5324-7769; feng, zhao zhong/0000-0002-9775-5113; xu, yan sen/0000-0002-2509-0992","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDB-SSW-DQC019]; Hundred Talents Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) for Senior Scientists [2013T2Z0009, 2016VBA057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500396]; CNR-CAS bilateral agreement Ozone impacts on plant ecosystems in China and Italy","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS; Hundred Talents Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) for Senior Scientists; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CNR-CAS bilateral agreement Ozone impacts on plant ecosystems in China and Italy","Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS, Grant/Award Number: QYZDB-SSW-DQC019; the Hundred Talents Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI) for Senior Scientists, Grant/Award Number: 2016VBA057 and 2013T2Z0009; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31500396; CNR-CAS bilateral agreement 2017-2019; Ozone impacts on plant ecosystems in China and Italy",NA,62,115,125,25,252,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,,PLANT CELL ENVIRON,Plant Cell Environ.,OCT,2017,40,10,,,,NA,2369,2380,,10.1111/pce.13043,0,NA,,12,Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences,FH0AP,28744869,Green Published,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000410801700025,0,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multi-stemmed trees, for example, differ in form and function from single-stemmed trees and may possess physiological advantages that allow for persistence during stressful climatic events such as extended drought. Following the worst drought in Hawaii in a century, we examined patterns of stem abundance and turnover in a Hawaiian lowland dry forest (LDF) and a montane wet forest (MWF) to investigate how multi-stemmed trees might influence site persistence, and how stem abundance and turnover relate to key functional traits. We found stem abundance and multi-stemmed trees to be an important component for climate resilience within the LDF. The LDF had higher relative abundance of multi-stemmed trees, stem abundance, and mean stem abundance compared to a reference MWF. Within the LDF, multi-stemmed trees had higher relative stem abundance (i.e., percent composition of stems to the total number of stems in the LDF) and higher estimated aboveground carbon than single-stemmed trees. Stem abundance varied among species and tree size classes. Stem turnover (i.e., change in stem abundance between five-year censuses) varied among species and tree size classes and species mean stem turnover was correlated with mean species stem abundance per tree. At the plot level, stem abundance per tree is also a predictor of survival, though mortality did not differ between multiple- and single-stemmed trees. Lastly, species with higher mean stem abundance per tree tended to have traits associated with a higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate, suggesting greater productivity in periods with higher water supply. Identifying the traits that allow species and forest communities to persist in dry environments or respond to disturbance is useful for forecasting ecological climate resilience or potential for restoration in tropical dry forests.","[Ware, Ian M.; Cordell, Susan; Giardina, Christian P.; Inman, Faith] US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, USDA, 60 Nowelo St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Ostertag, Rebecca] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Sack, Lawren; Medeiros, Camila D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Litton, Creighton M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Giambelluca, Thomas] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Water Resources Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Giambelluca, Thomas] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog & Environm, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [John, Grace P.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Scoffoni, Christine] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Dept Biol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles,"Ware, IM (autor correspondente), US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, USDA, 60 Nowelo St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",ian.ware@usda.gov; ostertag@hawaii.edu; susan.cordell@usda.gov; christian.p.giardina@usda.gov; lawrensack@ucla.edu; camilamedeiros@ucla.edu; finman@hawaii.edu; litton@hawaii.edu; thomas@hawaii.edu; gracejohn@ufl.edu; cscoffo@calstatela.edu,"Giardina, Christian P/C-3120-2011; Ostertag, Rebecca/B-1756-2013","Giardina, Christian P/0000-0002-3431-5073; ","NSF EPSCoR [0554657, 0903833]; United States Forest Service; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai'i at Manoa via the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [HAW00132-H, HAW01127-H, HAW00188-M, HAW01123-M]; National Science Foundation [2017949]; National Science Foundation Career grant [1943583]","NSF EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); United States Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, University of Hawai'i at Manoa via the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation Career grant(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Support to establish the HIPPNET plot network came from NSF EPSCoR grants 0554657 and 0903833.

Photosynthetic activity is an appropriate temperature-dependent functional trait linked to plant metabolism and performance. We employed photosynthesis as a stress temperature indicator. Regression analysis showed that in such regional climatic conditions, net photosynthetic rates were primarily correlated with temperature. The introduction of rainfall in the function did not significantly improve the theoretical prevision, in the range of temperature and rainfall analysed. The favourable leaf temperatures allowing 90-100% of the highest photosynthetic rates were 14-28 degrees C, decreasing over 50% when leaf temperature were respectively below 6 degrees C and over 37 degrees C: the low potential photochemical efficiency of 0.71 PSII (Fv/Fm) at Castelporziano during summer, confirmed the state of stress. Transpiration rates remained high with the increase of leaf temperature in summer, in spite of the 46% decrease of stomatal conductance. Nevertheless, this decrease allowed the maintenance of acceptable Pn rates in stressful conditions. The potential productivity of Q. ilex lied on high peaks of activity during periods of lower evaporative demand and a rapid stomatal response to an increase in air temperature and soil water deficit. Although it is difficult to forecast Q. ilex productivity and plant structure, we may hypothesize its future presence in the Mediterranean Basin by the capability of vegetative activity in a wide range of temperatures, the high stomatal control in stressful conditions, the high plasticity index and water use efficiency (WUE).

These extreme climate events can change ecosystem functions through driving plant growth and mortality, as well as ecological and evolutionary processes into different directions. We simulated a 1-in-100-year extreme precipitation event in different plant growth seasons (i.e. spring, summer, or autumn) to investigate the functional responses of a mesophytic alpine grassland ecosystem to climate change in the Tibetan plateau. The results demonstrated that the seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation is a critical factor in determining soil microbial- and plant-productivity. The response of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) to extreme precipitation depends on the growth seasons and plant types. Total NPP in the treatments experienced extreme precipitation in the early (spring), mid- (summer) and late (autumn) plant growth seasons were significant lower, higher, and no difference, respectively, compared with the control. Soil temperature and moisture were the key abiotic factors that affected ecosystem functions. For example, in the early plant growth season, no changes of soil moisture and the decreased temperature in response to the extreme precipitation resulted in a substantial decline in NPP. By contrast, in the mid-plant growth season, higher temperature and soil moisture elicited positive synergistic effects on plant growth and soil microbial processes. The increased sensitivity of above-ground NPP and the shift of dominant species from sedges to less palatable forbs might inevitably exaggerate the degradation of this grassland. Nevertheless, a high resilience index in the related ecological processes could potentially contribute to the grassland acclimation and stability, as most parameters returned to the similar levels as in the control after the extreme events ceased. Therefore, several synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms are hypothesized to operate in parallel or at different levels of organization and timescales. Further studies involving a range of different potential scenarios and longer periods are needed to predict the future climate change impacts on mesophytic grassland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We tested two hypothesized mechanisms, random species loss (RSL) and non-random species loss (NRSL), in the hardwood forest herbaceous layer of a long-term, plot-scale, fertilization experiment in the central Appalachian Mountains, USA. Using a random thinning algorithm, we simulated changes in species densities under RSL and compared the simulated densities to the observed densities among N-fertilized (+N), N-fertilized and limed (+N+L), and reference (REF) plots in regenerating forest stands. We found a lower S in the +N treatment across all survey years and determined that the reduction in S was a function of NRSL. Furthermore, non-random effects were observed in certain species, as they occurred at densities that were either higher or lower than expected due to RSL. Differential advantages were also observed among species between +N and +N+L treatments, suggesting that species responded to either the fertilization or acidification effects of N, though no consistent pattern emerged. Species nitrophily status was not a useful trait for predicting specific species losses, but was a significant factor when averaged across all treatments and sampling years. Our results provide strong evidence that declines in S in the forest herbaceous layer under N fertilization are due largely to NRSL and not simply a function of species rarity.","[Walter, Christopher A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol Bldg,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Adams, Mary Beth] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, USDA, 180 Canfield St, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Gilliam, Frank S.] Marshall Univ, Dept Biol Sci, One John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA; [Peterjohn, William T.] West Virginia Univ, Dept Biol, 53 Campus Dr, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Marshall University; West Virginia University,"Walter, CA (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 100 Ecol Bldg,1987 Upper Buford Circle, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",walte732@umn.edu,"Gilliam, Frank S./M-9767-2019","Gilliam, Frank S./0000-0002-5525-0766","USDA Forest Service; National Science Foundation [DEB-0417678, DEB-1019522]",USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Mark Burnham, Chris Cassidy, Jim McGraw, and the long-term support of the USDA Forest Service in establishing and maintaining research activities at the Fernow Experimental Forest.

Understanding how that biome responds to seasonality in water availability is essential to build scenarios of ecosystem functioning in the near future. Aims: Our aim was to test for seasonal variations in leaf traits related to primary productivity. Methods: Chemical composition, mass to area ratio and photosynthetic response curves to light and CO2 and of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to leaf-to-air water pressure deficit (nu) were determined from leaves of Amazonian trees and lianas. Results: Weak responses of g(s) to nu suggested limited stomatal control over transpiration. Dry season stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was not a common feature as only one individual studied (out of 14) exhibited concomitant decreases in light saturated photosynthetic rate (A(Sat)) and g(s) (measured during A(Sat)) associated with the dry season. Furthermore, 75% of the individuals evaluated did not show decreased photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax) during the dry season, suggesting limited seasonal leaf acclimation. Grouped analyses indicated that most parameters evaluated remained constant across seasons. The exceptions were leaf nitrogen and its isotopic signature, and the integrated stomatal sensitivity to light, CO2 and nu. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the notion that the dry season in eastern Amazonia is not associated with significant limitations in leaflevel photosynthesis.","[Domingues, Tomas F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Clima & Biosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfer, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Martinelli, Luiz A.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Energia Nucl Agr, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Domingues, TF (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Clima & Biosfera, Dept Ciencias Atmosfer, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",tdomingu@gmail.com,"Domingues, Tomas/G-9707-2011; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Martinelli, Luiz Antonio/F-7870-2011","Domingues, Tomas/0000-0003-2857-9838; Martinelli, Luiz Antonio/0000-0002-7103-7551",NASA LBA-Ecology; NASA LBA-Ecology grant,NASA LBA-Ecology; NASA LBA-Ecology grant,"We are in debt to our friends at the LBA-ECO Santarem office, to D.

Complementarity effects (via resource partitioning and facilitation, CEs) and selection effects (that is, dominant of species with particular traits, SEs) are the two hypotheses to explain biodiversity effects on ecosystem functions. This study aimed to (1) examine how tree species diversity affects fine root production and (2) disentangle the complementarity effect and the selection effect on the relationship between biodiversity and fine root production. A total of 60 tree clusters with 15 combinations of diversity gradients consisting of 1-4 tree species (Pinus massoniana,Choerospondias axillaris,Cyclobalanopsis glaucaandLithocarpus glaber) were established in subtropical forests. The sequential soil core and ingrowth core methods were used in each cluster to measure fine root biomass and productivity. Fine root production increased with increase in tree species richness. The biodiversity effects on fine root production mostly resulted from CEs. In the nongrowing season, in most cases, the CE on biomass was positive and became stronger as richness increased, but the opposite situation was observed in the growing season. The strong positive and negative effects of the proportions ofC. glaucaandL. glaberin the tree clusters on fine root biomass, CEs and SEs, suggest the coordinated action of species diversity and identity in modulating biodiversity effects on belowground processes.","[Liu, Cong; Xie, Binggeng] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cong; Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Zeng, Yelin; Lei, Pifeng] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Wenhua; Ouyang, Shuai; Zeng, Yelin; Lei, Pifeng; Peng, Changhui] Huitong Natl Stn Sci Observat & Res Chinese Fir P, Huitong 438107, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Changhui] Univ Quebec Montreal, Inst Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Hunan Normal University; Central South University of Forestry & Technology; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Xie, BG (autor correspondente), Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Xiang, WH (autor correspondente), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Fac Life Sci & Technol, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Xiang, WH (autor correspondente), Huitong Natl Stn Sci Observat & Res Chinese Fir P, Huitong 438107, Hunan, Peoples R China.",xiangwh2005@163.com; xbgyb1961@163.com,,"Xie, Binggeng/0000-0001-8083-8556","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31570447, 31870431]; Huitong Forest Ecological Station; State Forestry and grassland Administration of China; China Scholarship Council [201708430137]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Huitong Forest Ecological Station; State Forestry and grassland Administration of China; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570447 and 31870431) and the Huitong Forest Ecological Station, funded by the State Forestry and grassland Administration of China.

However, the impact of temperature on primary productivity is not sufficiently understood and water quality models need to be improved in order to assess the quantitative and qualitative changes of aquatic communities. On the basis of experimental data, we demonstrate that the commonly used photosynthetic and water chemistry parameters alone are not sufficient for modeling phytoplankton growth under changing temperature regimes. We present some new aspects of the acclimation process with respect to temperature and how contrasting responses may be explained by a more complete physiological knowledge of the energy flow from photons to new biomass. We further suggest including additional bio-markers/traits for algal growth such as carbon allocation patterns to increase the explanatory power of such models. Although carbon allocation patterns are promising and functional cellular traits for growth prediction under different nutrient and light conditions, their predictive power still waits to be tested with respect to temperature. A great challenge for the near future will be the prediction of primary production efficiencies under the global change scenario using a uniform model for phytoplankton assemblages.

The relationship between rooting depth and above-ground hydraulic traits can potentially define drought resistance strategies that are important in determining species distribution and coexistence in seasonal tropical forests, and understanding this is important for predicting the effects of future climate change in these ecosystems. 2. We assessed the rooting depth of 12 dominant tree species (representing c. 42% of the forest basal area) in a seasonal Amazon forest using the stable isotope ratios (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of water collected from tree xylem and soils from a range of depths. We took advantage of a major ENSO-related drought in 2015/2016 that caused substantial evaporative isotope enrichment in the soil and revealed water use strategies of each species under extreme conditions. We measured the minimum dry season leaf water potential both in a normal year (2014; Psi(non-ENSO)) and in an extreme drought year (2015; Psi(ENSO)). Furthermore, we measured xylem hydraulic traits that indicate water potential thresholds trees tolerate without risking hydraulic failure (P-50 and P-88). 3. We demonstrate that coexisting trees are largely segregated along a single hydrological niche axis defined by root depth differences, access to light and tolerance of low water potential. These differences in rooting depth were strongly related to tree size; diameter at breast height (DBH) explained 72% of the variation in the delta O-18(xylem). Additionally, delta O-18(xylem) explained 49% of the variation in P-50 and 70% of P-88, with shallow-rooted species more tolerant of low water potentials, while delta O-18 of xylem water explained 47% and 77% of the variation of minimum Psi(non-ENSO) and Psi(ENSO). 4. We propose a new formulation to estimate an effective functional rooting depth, i.e. the likely soil depth from which roots can sustain water uptake for physiological functions, using DBH as predictor of root depth at this site. Based on these estimates, we conclude that rooting depth varies systematically across the most abundant families, genera and species at the Tapajos forest, and that understorey species in particular are limited to shallow rooting depths. 5. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance, which also affect the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest. 6. Synthesis. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and demonstrate its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance (access to deep water vs. tolerance of very low water potentials).

This study thus supports the hypothesis in which the effects of individual species on the productivity-diversity relationships at the community level are related to their biomass density, an important functional trait.ContextThe productivity-diversity relationships have been extensively studied in various forest ecosystems, but key mechanisms underlying the productivity-diversity relationships still remain controversial.AimsThe objective of this study is to explore the productivity-diversity relationships at the community level, and to investigate the roles of individual species in shaping the community-level relationships between productivity and diversity under different forest types.MethodsThe study was conducted in two fully stem-mapped temperate mixed forest plots in Northeastern China: a natural secondary forest plot, and an old-growth forest plot. An individual-based study framework was used to estimate the productivity-diversity relationships at both species and community levels. A homogeneous Thomas point process was used to evaluate the significance of productivity-diversity relationship deviating from the neutral.ResultsAt the species level, most of the studied species exhibit neutral productivity-diversity relationship in both forest plots. The percentage of species showing negative productivity-diversity relationship approaches linearly a peak value for very close neighborhoods (the secondary forest plot: r=3m, 38%; the old-growth forest plot: r=4m, 42%), and then decreases gradually with increasing spatial scale. Interestingly, only a few species displayed positive productivity-diversity relationship within their neighborhoods. Dominant species mainly exhibit negative productivity-diversity relationship while tree species with lower importance values exhibit neutral productivity-diversity relationship in both forests. At the community level, a consistent pattern of productivity-diversity relationship was observed in both forests, where tree productivity is significantly negatively associated with local species richness. Four biomass-dominant species (Juglans mandshurica Maxim., Acer mono Maxim.,Ulmus macrocarpa Hance and Acer mandshuricum Maxim.) determined a negative productivity-diversity relationship at the community level in the secondary forest plot, but only one species (Juglans mandshurica) in the old-growth forest plot.ConclusionThe productivity-diversity relationship is closely related to the dominance of individual species at the species level. Moreover, this analysis is the first to report the roles of biomass-dominant species in shaping the productivity-diversity relationship at the community level.","[Cheng, Yanxia; Zhang, Chunyu; Zhao, Xiuhai] Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [von Gadow, Klaus] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, Busgenweg 5, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [von Gadow, Klaus] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Forest & Wood Sci, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Beijing Forestry University; University of Gottingen; Stellenbosch University,"Zhang, CY (autor correspondente), Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zcy_0520@163.com,"von Gadow, Klaus/N-6368-2015; Zhang, Chun-yu/HDP-5776-2022",,,,,NA,67,12,13,16,65,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1286-4560,1297-966X,,ANN FOREST SCI,Ann.

Grassland diversity can support sustainable intensification of grassland production through increased yields, reduced inputs and limited weed invasion. We report the effects of diversity on weed suppression from 3 years of a 31-site continental-scale field experiment. 2. At each site, 15 grassland communities comprising four monocultures and 11 four-species mixtures based on a wide range of species' proportions were sown at two densities and managed by cutting. Forage species were selected according to two crossed functional traits, method of nitrogen acquisition and pattern of temporal development. 3. Across sites, years and sown densities, annual weed biomass in mixtures and monocultures was 0.5 and 2.0 t DM ha(-1) (7% and 33% of total biomass respectively). Over 95% of mixtures had weed biomass lower than the average of monocultures, and in two-thirds of cases, lower than in the most suppressive monoculture (transgressive suppression). Suppression was significantly transgressive for 58% of site-years. Transgressive suppression by mixtures was maintained across years, independent of site productivity. 4. Based on models, average weed biomass in mixture over the whole experiment was 52% less (95% confidence interval: 30%-75%) than in the most suppressive monoculture. Transgressive suppression of weed biomass was significant at each year across all mixtures and for each mixture. 5. Weed biomass was consistently low across all mixtures and years and was in some cases significantly but not largely different from that in the equiproportional mixture. The average variability (standard deviation) of annual weed biomass within a site was much lower for mixtures (0.42) than for monocultures (1.77). 6. Synthesis and applications. Weed invasion can be diminished through a combination of forage species selected for complementarity and persistence traits in systems designed to reduce reliance on fertiliser nitrogen. In this study, effects of diversity on weed suppression were consistently strong across mixtures varying widely in species' proportions and over time. The level of weed biomass did not vary greatly across mixtures varying widely in proportions of sown species. These diversity benefits in intensively managed grasslands are relevant for the sustainable intensification of -agriculture and, importantly, are achievable through practical farm-scale actions.","[Connolly, John; Kirwan, Laura] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Sebastia, Maria-Teresa; Llurba, Rosa; Ribas, Angela] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Lab ECOFUN, Solsona, Spain; [Sebastia, Maria-Teresa; Llurba, Rosa] Univ Lleida, Grp GAMES, ETSEA, Lleida, Spain; [Sebastia, Maria-Teresa; Llurba, Rosa] Univ Lleida, Dept HBJ, ETSEA, Lleida, Spain; [Kirwan, Laura] Waterford Inst Technol, Waterford, Ireland; [Finn, John Anthony] Teagasc Environm Res Ctr, Johnstown Castle, Co Wexford, Ireland; [Suter, Matthias; Huguenin-Elie, Olivier; Luescher, Andreas] Agroscope Forage Prod & Grassland Syst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Collins, Rosemary P.; Fothergill, Michael] Aberystwyth Univ, IBERS, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Porqueddu, Claudio] CNR, ISPAAM, Sassari, Italy; [Helgadottir, Aslaug; Dalmannsdottir, Sigridur] Agr Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Baadshaug, Ole H.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Biosci, As, Norway; [Belanger, Gilles] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Black, Alistair] Teagasc Beef Res Ctr, Carlow, Co Meath, Ireland; [Brophy, Caroline] Maynooth Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Cop, Jure] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Biotech, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Dalmannsdottir, Sigridur; Jorgensen, Marit] NIBIO Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Tromso, Norway; [Delgado, Ignacio] CITA DGA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Elgersma, Anjo] Wageningen Univ, Plant Sci Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Frankow-Lindberg, Bodil E.] Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Ghesquiere, An] Inst Agr & Fisheries Res ILVO, Melle, Belgium; [Golinski, Piotr] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Grassland & Nat Landscape Sci, Poznan, Poland; [Grieu, Philippe] UMR ARCHE INRA ENSAT, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Gustavsson, Anne-Maj] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr Res Northern Sweden, Sect Crop Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Hoglind, Mats] NIBIO Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Klepp St, Norway; [Kadziuliene, Zydre] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Inst Agr, Kedainiai, Lithuania; [Lunnan, Tor] NIBIO Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Loken, Heggenes, Norway; [Nykanen-Kurki, Paivi] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Ecol Prod, Mikkeli, Finland; [Ribas, Angela] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Taube, Friedhelm] Univ Kiel, Inst Crop Sci & Plant Breeding, Kiel, Germany; [Thumm, Ulrich] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Stuttgart, Germany; [Elgersma, Anjo] POB 323, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands","University College Dublin; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Universitat de Lleida; Universitat de Lleida; South East Technological University (SETU); Teagasc; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Aberystwyth University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Institute of Biological, Environmental, Rural & Sciences (IBERS); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto Per Il Sistema Produzione Animale In Ambiente Mediterraneo (ISPAAM-CNR); Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Teagasc; Maynooth University; University of Ljubljana; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Wageningen University & Research; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Poznan University of Life Sciences; INRAE; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Kiel; University Hohenheim","Connolly, J (autor correspondente), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Math & Stat, Dublin 4, Ireland.",john.connolly@ucd.ie,"Höglind, Mats/AAT-1998-2021; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Golinski, Piotr/O-1719-2019; Ribas, Angela/L-5633-2014; Sebastia, M.

However, resprouting dynamics after fire and the time it takes to start producing flowers and fruits are still poorly understood, especially for the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado biome), where fire is an important driver of vegetation structure and ecosystem functioning. We investigated the resprouting dynamics and production of flowers and fruits of 26 woody species (20 tree and 6 shrub species for a total of 485 individuals) that were burned and the production of flowers and fruits for a subset of 12 species (139 individuals) in an unburned area in a Brazilian savanna. We classified the species' resprouting strategies as hypogeal (at the soil level, with main stem death), epigeal (on the main stem or crown), and hypogeal + epigeal. We used generalized linear mixed-effect models to identify the post-fire recovery patterns for five years. Individuals with basal resprouts (hypogeal and hypogeal + epigeal resprouting) produced an average of 6 basal resprouts, but only 33% of resprouts survived after five years. Individuals in burned areas produced fewer flowers and fruits than individuals in unburned areas. At least a subset of individuals in all the resprouting strategies started to produce flowers and fruits in the first-year post-fire. About 68% of the species with hypogeal resprouts produced flowers and fruits in the first-year post-fire, but the intensity of flowering and fruiting was lower compared to individuals with other resprouting strategies over time. Although woody species have invested in post-fire growth and sexual reproduction in all resprouting strategies, the long time needed to recover these processes can make these species more vulnerable to frequent fires.

Coastal wetlands are poorly represented in land surface models, but work is underway to improve process-based, predictive modeling of these ecosystems. Here, we identify guiding questions, potential simulations, and data needs to make progress in improving representation of vegetation in terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, with a focus on coastal and estuarine ecosystems. We synthesize relevant plant traits and environmental controls on vegetation that influence carbon cycling in coastal ecosystems. We propose that models include separate plant functional types (PFTs) for mangroves, graminoid salt marshes, and succulent salt marshes to adequately represent the variation in aboveground and belowground productivity between common coastal wetland vegetation types. We also discuss the drivers and carbon storage consequences of shifts in dominant PFTs. We suggest several potential approaches to represent the diversity in vegetation tolerance and adaptations to fluctuations in salinity and water level, which drive key gradients in coastal wetland ecosystems. Finally, we discuss data needs for parameterizing and evaluating model implementations of coastal wetland vegetation types and function.","[LaFond-Hudson, Sophia; Sulman, Benjamin] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37917 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"LaFond-Hudson, S (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37917 USA.",slafond09@gmail.com,,"LaFond-Hudson, Sophia/0000-0002-0860-2546",Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program; US Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725],Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"This work was supported by the Department of Energy Office of Science Early Career Research program as part of research in Earth System Model Development within the Earth and Environmental System Modeling Program.

Comparably little is known about how forest communities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community-level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species-level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species richness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more different. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated positive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition-driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized complementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two-species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness-productivity relationships are promoted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.","[Niklaus, Pascal A.; Baruffol, Martin; Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolut Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Jin-Sheng] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China","University of Zurich; Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Niklaus, PA (autor correspondente), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolut Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",pascal.niklaus@ieu.uzh.ch,"Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Baruffol, Martin/A-2406-2014","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Baruffol, Martin/0000-0001-9358-5885",,,,NA,63,51,52,9,158,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2017,98,4,,,,NA,1104,1116,,,,NA,,13,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EQ6ES,28129429,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000398175200022,0,Kauane,sim,,sim,sim,sim,forest,subtropical,NA,NA,leaf_habit((broadleaf_or_conifer);seasonality(evergreen_or_deciduous);leaf_mass_fraction;WD;SLA;LDMC;height; mean_leaf_height,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trait-based approaches have been considered a 'Holy Grail' in linking plants to ecosystem functions, but the mechanistic relationship between plant traits and the soil food web as an indicator of soil health remains poorly understood. We examined this relationship for 16 cover crop species differing in leaf and root traits in a field experiment where corn, Zea mays was the main crop. Based on functional traits, the cover crop species were categorized into two ecological strategies at either end of the resource acquisitive-conservative spectrum. We investigated the effects of cover crop ecological strategies on corn productivity and soil health. We used soil nematodes as an indicator of soil health and analysed soil physico-chemical properties and microbial community activities. We found that acquisitive cover crops supported higher soil resource availability, bacterial energy channels in the soil food web, and greater corn productivity than conservative cover crops. In contrast, conservative cover crops supported higher abundances of fungivores and omni-carnivores than acquisitive cover crop, which reflected a more structured and complex soil food web, implying a healthier soil ecosystem. Conservative cover crops also increased corn productivity compared to the no cover crop control treatment. Synthesis and applications. Collectively, this work shows that cover crops with distinct ecological strategies had their own strengths to enhance ecosystem functions: acquisitive and conservative cover crops improved crop productivity and soil health, respectively. These results indicates that farmers and policy makers can make trait-based choices in selecting cover crop best serving the local needs. This points to a win-win solution for food production and ecosystem sustainability.","[Zhang, Chongzhe; Xue, Wenfeng; Xue, Jingrong; Zhang, Jing; Qiu, Lujie; Chen, Xiaoyun; Hu, Feng; Liu, Manqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Soil Ecol Lab, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chongzhe; Zhang, Jing; Chen, Xiaoyun; Liu, Manqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Key Lab Biol Interact & Crop Hlth, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Waste, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden; [Liu, Manqiang] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Ctr Grassland Microbiome, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lanzhou University,"Liu, MQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Soil Ecol Lab, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Liu, MQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Key Lab Biol Interact & Crop Hlth, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Waste, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Liu, MQ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Pastoral Agr Sci & Technol, Ctr Grassland Microbiome, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",liumq@njau.edu.cn,"Hu, Feng/IAN-4009-2023; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Liu, Manqiang/G-6566-2012","Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Zhang, Chongzhe/0000-0002-1113-6283; Liu, Manqiang/0000-0001-6654-7795","China Agriculture Research System--Green Manure [CARS--22]; National Foundation of Sciences in China [41877056, 42077047]; National Key RD program [2021YFD1700202]",China Agriculture Research System--Green Manure; National Foundation of Sciences in China; National Key RD program,"China Agriculture Research System--Green Manure, Grant/Award Number: CARS--22; National Foundation of Sciences in China, Grant/Award Number: 41877056 and 42077047; National Key R&D program, Grant/Award Number: 2021YFD1700202",NA,108,3,3,42,90,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Biodiversity can contribute to increasing the ecosystem function, but its effect on consumer trophic levels remains inconclusive. We generated a multitrophic seed-herbivore-parasitoid food web based on seed traits, insect species abundance and richness, structural and functional food web attributes and the relationship between the seed biomass and the number of eggs laid by the herbivorous beetle Stator maculatophygus. We hypothesized that the food web structure (i.e., connectivity, linkage density and connectance) was determined by the parasitoid trophic levels. Our second hypothesis was that food web functionality (e.g., the parasitism rate) was not affected by the dominance of a single parasitoid species. From the seeds of a plant species (Senegalia tenufolia) (primary trophic level), we recorded nine species and four trophic levels, with one herbivore and seven parasitoids. A significant positive relationship was found between the number of eggs laid and the seed biomass. Connectivity and linkage density were affected by the parasitoid trophic level, and the dominance of a single parasitoid species led to decreases in the structural complexity and the parasitism rate. We described the relationship between structure and function in the field in a multitrophic host-parasitoid food web. The biodiversity of parasitoids plays an important role in the food web, maintaining its complexity and functionality. Synergies between processes acting at lower and higher levels may be driving the food web patterns presented here. Implications for insect conservation Our results highlight the positive role of parasitoid insect biodiversity in the biological population control of herbivorous insects in this microhabitat (fruit/seed). This demonstrates the importance of public policies aimed at the conservation of natural areas to maintain the diversity and ecosystem functions performed by parasitoid insects.","[Pedroso, Beatriz Mariana; Faria, Lucas Del Bianco] Univ Fed Lavras, Inst Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Conservacao, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Morales-Silva, Tiago] Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Entomol, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Faria, LD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Inst Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol & Conservacao, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil.;Morales-Silva, T (corresponding author), Univ Fed Lavras, Programa Posgrad Entomol, Mailbox 3037, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",tiagomorales.bio@gmail.com; lucasdbf@gmail.com,"Faria, Lucas/HZJ-0984-2023; Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/I-1832-2013; Morales-Silva, Tiago/AFS-9983-2022","Del Bianco Faria, Lucas/0000-0002-7230-800X; Morales-Silva, Tiago/0000-0002-7681-0312",FundacAo de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [140627/2017-0]; CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq: 306196/2018-2],FundacAo de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CoordenacAo de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Pedroso, B.

Mycorrhizal fungi are known for their functional importance in plant growth and nutrition, and because these symbiotic fungi represent a fundamental linkage between plants and soils, they likely underpin a number of biogeochemical processes in ecosystems. However, our ability to isolate and quantify their role in ecosystems has remained a challenge. 2. This special feature presents seven new studies that advance our understanding of how mycorrhizal fungi contribute to ecosystem function. We specifically highlight two complementary approaches by which ecologists are gaining insight: focusing on mycorrhizal fungal traits to target the biological mechanisms that scale up to the ecosystem, and capturing patterns and processes across ecosystems to understand the net effect of complex plant-fungal-soil interactions. 3. The studies in our special feature provide evidence that traits both within and across species of mycorrhizal fungi can contribute to ecosystem processes, and that disturbance from global change and management may result in altered mycorrhizal traits and lead to compromised ecosystem function. From a broader perspective, studies also demonstrate that key ecosystem properties vary over gradients of mycorrhizal dominance and time, suggesting that mycorrhizal effects emerge from complex interactions within ecosystems 4. Synthesis. Employing complementary approaches to the study of mycorrhizal ecology may allow us to isolate the mycorrhizal traits that matter most for ecosystem properties, as well as the suite of ecosystem properties that result from mycorrhizal fungi, thus converging on biogeochemical mechanisms that underpin terrestrial ecosystem function.","[Wurzburger, Nina] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Clemmensen, Karina E.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Uppsala BioCtr, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Wurzburger, N (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",ninawurz@uga.edu,"Clemmensen, Karina Engelbrecht/C-9555-2014","Clemmensen, Karina Engelbrecht/0000-0002-9627-6428; Wurzburger, Nina/0000-0002-6143-0317",U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service; Southern Research Station; Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research program; NSF [DEB-0823923]; Swedish Research Council [2015-04411],U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service; Southern Research Station; Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research program; NSF, Grant/Award Number: DEB-0823923; Swedish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04411",NA,40,6,8,3,146,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Collembola are among the most abundant and diverse decomposers and are known to modify plant growth. We examined the effects of Collembola species diversity (one, two and three species belonging to different life history groups) and composition on litter decomposition and the performance of plant communities (above- and below-ground productivity) of different functional groups (grasses, forbs and legumes). Collembola densities did not increase with diversity indicating niche overlap. Generally, Collembola species composition was a better predictor for ecosystem functioning than Collembola species number with the impacts of Collembola diversity and composition on ecosystem functioning strongly depending on plant functional group identity. Non-linear effects of Collembola diversity on litter decomposition and plant productivity suggest pronounced and context dependent species interactions and feeding habits. Net surface litter decomposition was decreased by Collembola, whereas root litter decomposition was at maximum in the highest Collembola diversity treatment. Forbs benefitted most from the presence of three Collembola species. Similarly, Collembola diversity influenced root depth distribution in a plant functional group specific way: while grass root biomass decreased with increasing Collembola diversity in the upper and lower soil layer, legume root biomass increased particularly in the lower soil layer. Idiosyncratic and context dependent effects of Collembola diversity and composition even in rather simple assemblages of one to three species suggest that changes in Collembola diversity may have unpredictable consequences for ecosystem functioning. The finding that changes in Collembola performance did not directly translate to alterations in ecosystem functioning indicates that response traits do pot necessarily conform to effect traits. Distinct plant functional group specific impacts of Collembola diversity on root depth distribution are likely to modify plant competition in complex plant communities and add a novel mechanism how decomposers may affect plant community assembly.

The root-soil interface is a highly active zone due to root exudation and nutrient uptake. However, its role in determining effects of tree species and their interactions on the soil microbial community, ecosystem function and above-ground growth is less well known. We compared the effects of tree species monocultures and their mixture on rhizospheric microbial communities, specific functional genetic markers associated with processes in the nitrogen (N) cycle, and above-ground and below-ground growth and nutrient allocation. Two pairs of tree species were grown: Pseudotsuga menziesii and Alnus rubra; Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus robur. Tree establishment altered soil microbial composition, but after 26 months differences amongst tree species and effects of species mixture were minor, suggesting functional redundancy in microbial communities. A greater abundance of fungi, bacteria, and specifically ammonia oxidising and denitrifying bacteria in the rhizospheric soil of the N-fixing A. rubra was the most notable trend. Mixing A. rubra with P. menziesii did produce overyielding: trees grown in mixture attained a two-fold greater (Relative Yield Total 2.03 & PLUSMN; 0.52) above-ground biomass than in a mixture predicted from trees grown in monoculture. We did not observe strong trends in overyielding for A. psuedoplatanus and Q. robur. Inclusion of the N-fixing species A. rubra in admixture with P. menziesii promoted N cycling, and decreased the C: N ratios of leaf, branch, and root tissues but not soil C:N ratio for P. menziesii. Given the observed overyielding in the A. rubra with P. menziesii mixtures, we explored potential mechanistic links between functional genetic markers for nitrification and ammonification, however we found no statistically significant effects attributable to these genetic markers. We found root area index was significantly lower in A. rubra monocultures than in admixture with P. menziesii. For both P. menziesii and A. rubra, the number of root tips was lower in mixture than monoculture, indicating physical partitioning of soil space as a result of growing in mixture. We documented additive and synergistic effects of tree species identity on above and belowground productivity, and rhizospheric microbial community development in these four tree species.","[Ribbons, Relena R.; Smith, Andy R.; Healey, John R.; McDonald, Morag A.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Ribbons, Relena R.; Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Del Toro, Israel] Lawrence Univ, Dept Biol, Appleton, WI 54911 USA; [Ribbons, Relena R.] Lawrence Univ, Dept Geosci, Appleton, WI 54911 USA",Bangor University; University of Copenhagen; Lawrence University; Lawrence University,"Ribbons, RR (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",rribbons@gmail.com,"Smith, Andy/A-7512-2011; Healey, John R/J-3719-2016; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011","Smith, Andy/0000-0001-8580-278X; Healey, John R/0000-0002-5398-2293; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales through the Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment","Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission; Welsh Government; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales through the Ser Cymru National Research Network for Low Carbon, Energy and Environment","R.R.R. was funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under Erasmus Mundus Action 1 through individual Doctoral fellowships as part of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Programme Forests and Nature for Society (FONASO) .

Despite these changes, the driving factors that control shrubification and its future trajectory remain uncertain. Here we used an ecosystem model, ecosys, to mechanistically represent the processes controlling recent and 21st century changes in plant functional type using RCP8.5 climate forcing across North American Arctic tundra. Recent and projected warming was modeled to deepen the active layer (spatially averaged by similar to 0.35m by 2100) and thereby increase nutrient availability. Shrub productivity was modeled to increase across much of the tundra, particularly in Alaska and tundra-boreal ecotones. Deciduous and evergreen shrubs increased from similar to 45% of total tundra ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) in recent decades to similar to 70% by 2100. The increased canopy cover of shrubs reduced incoming shortwave radiation for low-lying plants, causing declines in graminoids NPP from a current 35% of tundra NPP to 18%, and declines in nonvascular plants from 20% to 12%. The faster-growing deciduous shrubs modeled with less efficient nutrient conservation dominated much of the low Arctic by 2100 where nutrient cycling became more rapid, while the slower-growing evergreen shrubs modeled with more efficient nutrient conservation dominated a wider latitudinal range that extended to the high Arctic where nutrient cycling remained slower. We conclude that high-latitude vegetation dynamics over the 21st century will depend strongly on soil nutrient dynamics, diversity in plant traits controlling nutrient uptake and conservation, and light competition.","[Mekonnen, Zelalem A.; Riley, William J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Grant, Robert F.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Alberta,"Mekonnen, ZA (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zmekonnen@lbl.gov,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Mekonnen, Zelalem/M-7144-2017","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Mekonnen, Zelalem/0000-0002-2647-0671","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the Director, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research of the U.S. Department of Energy under contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments in the Arctic (NGEE Arctic) project.

However, the assembly processes and driving factors of soil microbial communities across secondary forest succession remain unclear. Here, we studied the assembly processes of soil microbial communities and examined shifts in soil microbial community-associated functional dynamics across secondary forest succession. Our results showed that the stochastic process was more important in shaping bacterial community assembly throughout the successional process [modified stochasticity ratio (MST) > 50%], while the fungal community assembly was initially governed by deterministic processes (MST < 50%), but there was a progressive increase in stochastic selection as succession proceeded. Soil organic carbon and pH were principal factors for the explanation of changes in the bacterial community structure (total explained 43% change), and tree richness and productivity were principal factors for the explanation of shifts in the fungal community structure (total explained 17% change). The relative abundance of nitrogen transformation and saprotroph functional groups increased gradually with succession, whereas ectomycorrhizal fungi significantly declined. The results suggested that microbial community succession might accelerate the soil carbon and nitrogen turnover rates. Used together, the mechanisms shaping fungal and bacterial community structure are different in secondary forest succession and highlight that those fungi and bacteria are primarily controlled by plant traits and soil properties, respectively. Variations in microbial functional groups provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the soil microbe-driven soil nutrient cycles during secondary forest succession.","[Yan, Guoyong; Luo, Xi; Huang, Binbin; Wang, Honglin; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xingyu; Gao, Honglin; Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Modern Agr & Ecol Environm, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mingxin] Heilongjiang Inst Construct Technol, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Xing, Yajuan; Wang, Qinggui] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China",Qufu Normal University; Heilongjiang University; Qufu Normal University,"Xing, YJ; Wang, QG (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Qufu 273165, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xingyajuan@163.com; qgwang1970@163.com,,"Wang, Qinggui/0000-0003-2456-5770","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42230703, 41773075, 41575137]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42230703, 41773075, and 41575137).",NA,74,0,0,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

The study site was contaminated by heavy metals from a zinc smelter that operated near Palmerton, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. C-3 plants only contributed 1.16% of aboveground primary productivity, whereas recently seeded (5-7 year old) warm season C-4 grasses contributed the remaining 98.84%. Analyses of tissue samples revealed that the carbon content of invertebrates and vertebrates did not reflect the composition of the vegetation. Of 135 samples, 48 (36%) had greater than 75% of their carbon from C-4-derived sources, while 32 (24%) of the samples had less than 25%. However, carbon from C-4 grasses passed through to higher trophic levels, as shown by the abundance of predators with a high proportion of C-4-derived carbon. We document three channels of carbon flux through the food web, one based on warm season grasses, now supporting a functioning ecosystem at all key trophic levels, one based on C-3 plants, and a third based on detritus. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that relative configurations of such channels are important to ecosystem stability. Our results suggest that functional groupings of plants based on photosynthetic pathway or other plant traits likely form the basis for food web compartments. By using diverse functional groups of plants for reclamation or restoration, practitioners may be able to aid the development of channels and thereby promote desired ecosystem states.","[Fetcher, Ned] Wilkes Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA; [Agosta, Salvatore J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Agosta, Salvatore J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Stratford, Jeffrey A.; Steele, Michael A.] Wilkes Univ, Dept Biol, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA",Wilkes University; Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University; Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Wilkes University,"Fetcher, N (corresponding author), Wilkes Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA.",ned.fetcher@wilkes.edu,"Fetcher, Ned/ABE-9438-2020; Moore, John/E-9802-2011","Fetcher, Ned/0000-0003-2604-299X; ",Wild Resource Conservation Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,Wild Resource Conservation Program of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"We acknowledge J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that plant functional traits, especially physiological traits, can be successfully derived from hyperspectral images. Plant physiological traits are frequently quantified either as area-based content [mu g cm(-2)] or mass-based concentration [mg g(-1) or %]. However, it remains unclear whether the two metrics of traits can be quantified using remote sensing approaches. We quantified area- and mass-based foliar physiological traits to compare the prediction accuracy of the two metrics based on leaf spectra using partial least squares regression (PLSR) at a grassland monoculture experiment. These two metrics were then scaled up to canopy traits, respectively, based on leaf area index (LAI) and biomass to test their performance at the canopy level. The canopy physiological traits with high prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.60) were selected for mapping using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based UHD185 spectrometer. Biomass and LAI were also estimated and mapped using the PLSR method. The mapped leaf traits (canopy traits divided by the corresponding LAI), were used to explore the relationships between the interspecific and intraspecific variations in leaf physiological traits and ecosystem productivity (i.e., aboveground biomass). The results showed that the retrieval of leaf physiological traits using leaf spectra and canopy spectra or remote sensing was better performed on an area basis rather than a mass basis, especially for the physiological traits related to photosynthesis. Model selection results also indicted that remotely sensed physiological traits (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid, carbon, nitrogen, and leaf mass per area (LMA)) and their intraspecific variations (coefficient variation (CV) for a single trait and functional richness (FRic) for multiple traits) were significant predictors of community aboveground biomass across grassland monocultures. Our study highlights the potential of hyperspectral images for trait mapping and estimating ecosystem productivity at large scales. Our findings also provide a vital insight for disentangling the links of functional traits and intra- and interspecific trait variations to key ecological processes and functions.","[Zhao, Yujin; Sun, Yihan; Lu, Xiaoming; Zhao, Xuezhen; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yihan; Zhao, Xuezhen; Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Long; Sun, Zhongyu] Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou 510070, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences","Bai, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"zhao, xuezhen/GXH-1171-2022; Lu, Xiaoming/AAE-6302-2022","Lu, Xiaoming/0000-0001-7380-0699; Sun, Yihan/0000-0002-0509-1330; Zhao, Yujin/0000-0003-0225-6491","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604702]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801230, 31630010]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0604702) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801230 and 31630010).

One way to address this complexity is to track ecosystem processes through the lens of plant functional traits. Elevational gradients with diverse biotic and abiotic conditions offer ideal settings for inferring functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally. However, most studies have focused on differences in mean trait values among species, and little is known on how intraspecific traits vary along wide elevational gradients and how this variability reflects ecosystem productivity. We measured functional traits of the sub-shrub Koenigia mollis (Basionym: Polygonum molle; a widespread species) in 11 populations along a wide elevational gradient (1515-4216 m) considering from subtropical forest to alpine treeline in the central Himalayas. After measuring different traits (plant height, specific leaf area, leaf area, length of flowering branches, leaf carbon isotope (delta C-13), leaf carbon and leaf nitrogen concentrations), we investigated drivers on changes of these traits and also characterized their relationships with elevation, climate and ecosystem productivity. All trait values decreased with increasing elevation, except for delta C-13 that increased upwards. Likewise, most traits showed strong positive relationships with potential evapotranspiration, while delta C-13 exhibited a negative relationship. In this context, elevation-dependent water-energy dynamics is the primary driver of trait variations. Furthermore, six key traits (plant height, length of flowering branch, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, leaf nitrogen and leaf delta C-13) explained 90.45% of the variance in ecosystem productivity. Our study evidences how elevation-dependent climate variations affect ecosystem processes and functions. Intraspecific variability in leaf functional traits is strongly driven by changes in water-energy dynamics, and reflects changes in ecosystem productivity over elevation. K. mollis, with one of the widest elevational gradients known to date, could be a model species to infer functional trait responses to environmental gradients globally. As inferred from K. mollis, the water-energy dynamics can be a hydrothermal variable to understand the formation of vegetation boundaries, such as alpine treeline. This study sheds new insight on how plants modify their basic ecological strategies to cope with changing environments.

It is uncertain if highly diverse vegetation requires more local PFTs. Here, we analyzed how 52 tree species of a megadiverse mountain rain forest separate into local tree functional types (TFTs) for two functions: biomass production and solar radiation partitioning. We derived optical trait indicators (OTIs) by relating leaf optical metrics and functional traits through factor analysis. We distinguished four OTIs explaining 38%, 21%, 15%, and 12% of the variance, of which two were considered important for biomass production and four for solar radiation partitioning. The clustering of species-specific OTI values resulted in seven and eight TFTs for the two functions, respectively. The first TFT ensemble (P-TFTs) represented a transition from low to high productive types. The P-TFT were separated with a fair average silhouette width of 0.41 and differed markedly in their main trait related to productivity, Specific Leaf Area (SLA), in a range between 43.6 to 128.2 (cm(2)/g). The second delineates low and high reflective types (E-TFTs), were subdivided by different levels of visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) albedo. The E-TFTs were separated with an average silhouette width of 0.28 and primarily defined by their VIS/NIR albedo. The eight TFT revealed an especially pronounced range in NIR reflectance of 5.9% (VIS 2.8%), which is important for ecosystem radiation partitioning. Both TFT sets were grouped along elevation, modified by local edaphic gradients and species-specific traits. The VIS and NIR albedo were related to altitude and structural leaf traits (SLA), with NIR albedo showing more complex associations with biochemical traits and leaf water. The TFTs will support LSM simulations used to analyze the functioning of mountain rainforests under climate change.","[Limberger, Oliver; Bendix, Joerg] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing LCRS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Farwig, Nina] Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Conservat Ecol, Karl von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Pucha-Cofrep, Franz; Trachte, Katja] Brandenburg Univ Technol BTU Cottbus Senftenberg, Inst Environm Sci, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Pucha-Cofrep, Franz] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Grp Invest Hidrol & Climatol, Ecuador Calle Paris, Loja 110107, Ecuador; [Fries, Andreas] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Geol & Mine & Civil Engn DGMIC, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador",Philipps University Marburg; University of Gottingen; Philipps University Marburg; Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja,"Limberger, O (corresponding author), Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Lab Climatol & Remote Sensing LCRS, Deutschhausstr 12, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.",limbergo@staff.uni-marburg.de; jhomeie@gwdg.de; farwig@staff.uni-marburg.de; franzpc@gmail.com; aefries@utpl.edu.ec; cleusch@gwdg.de; katja.trachte@b-tu.de; bendix@mailer.uni-marburg.de,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011; Trachte, Katja/M-7310-2015","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Trachte, Katja/0000-0003-4269-9668; Bendix, Jorg/0000-0001-6559-2033; Pucha-Cofrep, Franz/0000-0002-5556-4028; , Andreas/0000-0001-5357-5682; Farwig, Nina/0000-0002-0554-5128","German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR2730, BE1780/51-1, TR1201/3-1, HO3296/6-1, LE762/17-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the Research Unit FOR2730 (RESPECT: Environmental changes in biodiversity hotspot ecosystems of South Ecuador: RESPonse and feedback effECTs).

However, the role of phytoplankton functional diversity in ecosystem productivity and stability under fluctuating (i.e. non-equilibrium) environments remains largely unknown. Here we use a marine ecosystem model to study the effect of phytoplankton functional diversity on both ecosystem productivity and its stability for seasonally variable nutrient supply and temperature. Functional diversity ranges from low to high along these two environmental axes independently. Changes in diversity are obtained by varying the range of uptake strategies and thermal preferences of the species present in the community. Species can range from resource gleaners to opportunists, and from cold to warm thermal preferences. The phytoplankton communities self-assemble as a result of species selection by resource competition (nutrients) and environmental filtering (temperature). Both processes lead to species asynchrony but their effect on productivity and stability differ. We find that the diversity of temperature niches has a strong and direct positive effect on productivity and stability due to species complementarity, while the diversity of uptake strategies has a weak and indirect positive effect due to sampling probability. These results show that more functionally diverse phytoplankton communities lead to higher and more stable ecosystem productivity but the positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning depends critically on the type of environmental gradient.

Using a 7-year grassland experiment in Inner Mon-golian steppe, we examined the relative importance of direct versus indirect (through mediating plant and arthropod biodiversity) effects of four land-use types (growing-season grazing, spring & summer grazing, mowing and enclosure) and precipitation variation in two climatically contrasting years on plant and arthropod productivity. Our results showed that: (1) the variation patterns of species and functional diversity and pro-ductivity across land use types were significantly different between plant and arthropod communities, though both plants and arthropods had their community-weighted mean size (i.e., plant height and arthropod body size) decreased under grazing or mowing; (2) moderate grazing and plant growing-season precipitation enhanced plant productivity mainly via indirectly increasing plant functional dispersion and decreasing plant nitrogen concentration associated with the shift in dominant species, but reduced arthropod productivity majorly by direct grazing damage and less importantly by indirect mediation of arthropod body size; (3) grassland man-agement and precipitation-induced variations in plant and arthropod productivity could be well explained by the changes in their functional traits and diversity, but not species richness. Our results indicate the importance of trait-based method in understanding the mechanisms of management and precipitation affecting plant and arthropod productivity, and suggest that biological traits in multiple trophic groups can be used as efficient indicators in the assessment of grassland ecosystem health.","[Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Zhang, Junzhen; Liu, Jiayue; Wang, Yanan; Guo, Ying; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinyu; Li, Frank Yonghong; Zhang, Junzhen; Liu, Jiayue; Wang, Yanan; Guo, Ying; Baoyin, Taogetao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinmin] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia University; Inner Mongolia University; Inner Mongolia Normal University,"Li, FY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Minist Educ, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.;Li, FY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.",lifyhong@126.com,,"Li, Frank Yonghong/0000-0002-5137-8017",Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China [2021ZD0011]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0500508],"Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",The research was supported by the Department of Science and Technology of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China (Grant No. 2021ZD0011 and Grant for Key Basic Research on Grassland Ecosystem Functional Processes and Services of Grassland Ecosystems) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0500508) .,NA,79,0,0,18,48,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Moreover, soil properties related to nutrient availability were shown to change with plant diversity over time; however, it is not well-understood whether and how such plant diversity-dependent soil changes and associated changes in functional traits contribute to positive diversity-productivity relationships in the long run. To test this, we investigated plant communities of different species richness (1, 2, 6, and 9 species) in a 15-year-old grassland biodiversity experiment. We determined community biomass production and biodiversity effects (net biodiversity [NEs], complementarity [CEs], and selection effects [SEs]), as well as community means of plant functional traits and soil properties. First, we tested how these variables changed along the plant diversity gradient and were related to each other. Then, we tested for direct and indirect effects of plant and soil variables influencing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Community biomass production, NEs, CEs, SEs, plant height, root length density (RLD), and all soil property variables changed with plant diversity and the presence of the dominant grass species Arrhenatherum elatius (increase except for soil pH, which decreased). Plant height and RLD for plant functional traits, and soil pH and organic carbon concentration for soil properties, were the variables with the strongest influence on biomass production and biodiversity effects. Our results suggest that plant species richness and the presence of the dominant species, A. elatius, cause soil organic carbon to increase and soil pH to decrease over time, which increases nutrient availability favoring species with tall growth and dense root systems, resulting in higher biomass production in species-rich communities. Here, we present an additional process that contributes to the strengthening positive diversity-productivity relationship, which may play a role alongside the widespread plant functional trait-based explanation.","[Dietrich, Peter; Roscher, Christiane] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Physiol Divers, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter; Eisenhauer, Nico; Roscher, Christiane] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol Expt Interact Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Dietrich, Peter] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geobot, Halle, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Dietrich, P (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Geobot, Halle, Germany.",peter.dietrich@idiv.de,"Dietrich, Peter/AAL-6987-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012","Dietrich, Peter/0000-0002-7742-6064; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG-FZT 118, 202548816, FOR 1451, FOR 5000]; Heinrich Boll Foundation",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Heinrich Boll Foundation,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: DFG-FZT 118, 202548816, FOR 1451 and FOR 5000; Heinrich Boll Foundation",NA,74,0,0,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Based on more than a decade of field measurements in a biodiversity hotspot of southern Ecuador, we implemented plant trait variation and improved soil organic matter dynamics in a widely used dynamic vegetation model (the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator, LPJ-GUESS) to explore the main drivers of community assembly along an elevational gradient. In the model used here (LPJ-GUESS-NTD, where NTD stands for nutrient-trait dynamics), each plant individual can possess different trait combinations, and the community trait composition emerges via ecological sorting. Further model developments include plant growth limitation by phosphorous (P) and mycorrhizal nutrient uptake. The new model version reproduced the main observed community trait shift and related vegetation processes along the elevational gradient, but only if nutrient limitations to plant growth were activated. In turn, when traits were fixed, low productivity communities emerged due to reduced nutrient-use efficiency. Mycorrhizal nutrient uptake, when deactivated, reduced net primary production (NPP) by 61-72% along the gradient. Our results strongly suggest that the elevational temperature gradient drives community assembly and ecosystem functioning indirectly through its effect on soil nutrient dynamics and vegetation traits. This illustrates the importance of considering these processes to yield realistic model predictions.","[Dantas de Paula, Mateus; Forrest, Matthew; Langan, Liam; Hickler, Thomas] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Bendix, Joerg] Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol & Ecosyst Res, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Velescu, Andre; Wilcke, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Hickler, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Phys Geog, Geosci, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",Senckenberg Biodiversitat & Klima- Forschungszentrum (BiK-F); Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Philipps University Marburg; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Goethe University Frankfurt,"de Paula, MD (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",mateus.dantas@senckenberg.de,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011; Wilcke, Wolfgang/P-4620-2016; Dantas de Paula, Mateus/D-7852-2016; Hickler, Thomas/S-6287-2016","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Wilcke, Wolfgang/0000-0002-6031-4613; Forrest, Matthew/0000-0003-1858-3489; Bendix, Jorg/0000-0001-6559-2033; Dantas de Paula, Mateus/0000-0003-4350-2572; Hickler, Thomas/0000-0002-4668-7552; Langan, Liam/0000-0002-4765-9510","DFG (German Research Foundation) [FOR2730, FOR 402, FOR 816]",DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the DFG (German Research Foundation) for funding this study in the scope of the Research Unit FOR2730 RESPECT, as well as the previous research units FOR 402 and 816 which contributed long-term data.

However, the direct and indirect effects of nitrogen addition and biodiversity on the links between plant traits and ecosystem functions have been largely overlooked, even though multidimensional characteristics of plant functional traits are probably critical predictors of ecosystem functions. Methods To investigate the mechanism underlying the links between plant trait identity, diversity, network topology and above- and below-ground biomass along a plant species richness gradient under different nitrogen addition levels, a common garden experiment was conducted in which those driving factors were manipulated. Key Results The study found that nitrogen addition increased above-ground biomass but not below-ground biomass, while species richness was positively associated with above- and below-ground biomass. Nitrogen addition had minor effects on plant trait identity and diversity, and on the connectivity and complexity of the trait networks. However, species richness increased above-ground biomass mainly by increasing leaf trait diversity and network modularity, and enhanced below-ground biomass through an increase in root nitrogen concentration and network modularity. Conclusions The results demonstrate the mechanistic links between community biomass and plant trait identity, diversity and network topology, and show that the trait network architecture could be an indicator of the effects of global changes on ecosystem functions as importantly as trait identity and diversity.","[Wang, Chao; Hou, Yanhui; Hu, Yanxia; Zheng, Ruilun; Li, Xiaona] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Grassland Flowers & Ecol, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China",Beijing Academy of Agriculture & Forestry Sciences (BAAFS),"Wang, C; Li, XA (corresponding author), Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Grassland Flowers & Ecol, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China.",wangchao@grass-env.com; lxn1977@126.com,,,,,,NA,48,0,0,14,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Here, we tested under glasshouse conditions how plant community attributes, including variations in the dominance, diversity and range of plant functional traits, influence N uptake and retention in temperate grassland. We added a pulse of N-15 to grassland plant communities assembled to represent a range of community-weighted mean plant traits, trait functional diversity and divergence, and species richness, and measured plant and microbial uptake of N-15, and leaching losses of N-15, as a short-term test of N retention in the plant-soil system. Root biomass, herb abundance and dominant plant traits were the main determinants of N retention in the plant-soil system: greater root biomass and herb abundance, and lower root tissue density, increased plant N-15 uptake, while higher specific leaf area and root tissue density increased microbial N-15 uptake. Our results provide novel, mechanistic insight into the short-term fate of N in the plant-soil system, and show that dominant plant traits, rather than trait functional diversity, control the fate of added N in the plant-soil system.","[de Vries, Franciska T.; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Oxford Rd, Oxford M13 9PT, England",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester,"de Vries, FT (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Oxford Rd, Oxford M13 9PT, England.",franciska.devries@manchester.ac.uk,"de Vries, Franciska T/D-3041-2009; de Vries, Franciska/AAD-5760-2021","de Vries, Franciska T/0000-0002-6822-8883; de Vries, Franciska/0000-0002-6822-8883",EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE; BBSRC [BB/L02456X/1]; BBSRC [BB/L02456X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L02456X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE; BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"This work was supported by the EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE, and F.T.d.V. is additionally funded by a BBSRC David Phillips Fellowship (BB/L02456X/1).

Our results showed that root traits ofS. alterniflorawere more sensitive to changing soil nutrient availability than those ofP. australis. The SEMs indicated that soil nutrient availability increasedS. alternifloraproductivity by increasing root nitrogen concentration and root length density. InP. australis, temperature could increase productivity by both increasing root length density and soil nutrient-mediated root nitrogen concentration. The studied root architectural trait (root length density) and nutrient trait (root nitrogen concentration) were effective in predicting productivity, whereas none of the root morphological traits (i.e., specific root length, root tissue density, and root diameter) significantly affected productivity.

However, it remains unclear whether there are critical transitions or tipping points for the response of plant growth or traits to N enrichment, and how these responses differ to different N forms. We chose the native, perennial clonal grass, Leymus chinensis in Inner Mongolia steppe, and conducted a field experiment, in which six N addition rates (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and five N compound types [NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, NH4HCO3, CO(NH2)(2), slow-release CO(NH2)(2)] are considered. Here, we found that the different N compound types had no significant effect on the growth of L. chinensis. N addition rate significantly increased plant aboveground biomass and leaf nitrogen concentration, whereas decreased leaf dry matter content. The tipping point for N-induced aboveground biomass increase was at 10 g N m(-2) year(-1), and the changes in functional traits were at N addition rates of 20 g N m(-2) year(-1). Our findings suggested that the responses of aboveground biomass and functional traits to N addition were asymmetric, in which responses in aboveground biomass were more sensitive than that in functional traits. The differential sensitivity of aboveground biomass and functional traits of L. chinensis occurred to N deposition highlights the importance of functional traits in mediating ecosystem functioning in the face of N deposition, regardless of which chemical forms dominate in the deposited N.","[Yang, Guojiao; Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guojiao; Liu, Qianguang] Hainan Univ, Key Lab Agroforestry Environm Proc & Ecol Regulat, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zijia] Hainan Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guangming] Changzhi Med Coll, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Changzhi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Peiming; Wang, Renqing] Shandong Univ, Qingdao Forest Ecol Res Stn, Natl Forestry Grassland Adm, Qingdao, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Hainan University; Changzhi Medical College; Shandong University; Shandong University,"Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), Hainan Ecol Environm Monitoring Ctr, Haikou, Peoples R China.;Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Engn & Technol Res Ctr Vegetat Ecol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Zheng, PM (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Qingdao Forest Ecol Res Stn, Natl Forestry Grassland Adm, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",zhangzijia@gmail.com; zhengpeiming@email.sdu.edu.cn,,,,,,NA,50,0,0,23,49,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

However, the importance of tree diversity in determining multifunctionality in structurally complex subtropical forests relative to other regulators (e.g., soil microbial diversity, stand structure, and environmental conditions) remains uncertain. In this study, effects of aboveground (species richness and functional and structural diversity) and belowground (bacterial and fungal diversity) biodiversity, functional composition (community-weighted means of species traits), stand structure (diameter at breast height and stand density), and soil factors (pH and bulk density) on multifunctionality (including biomass production, carbon stock, and nutrient cycling) were examined along a tree diversity gradient in subtropical forests. The community-weighted mean of tree maximum height was the best predictor of ecosystem multifunctionality. Functional diversity explained a higher proportion of the variation in multifunctionality than that of species richness and fungal diversity. Stand structure -played an important role in modulating the effects of tree diversity on multifunctionality.

We reviewed 408 publications on ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and plant functional traits related to ES in forest ecosystems. Strategies were proposed and key scientific issues were pointed out to improve the forest ecosystem in the karst desertification area. The results showed that the total number of publications has increased rapidly since 2014, of which biodiversity studies contributed the majority. China, the USA, and Germany were the top three countries, accounting for 41%, 9%, and 6% of the research, respectively. Further review found that structure, species diversity, and functional traits have an apparent effect on ES at different (macro, meso, and micro) scales. The optimization of tree structure contributes to the improvement in ES provision and the regulation capacity. Species diversity plays an important role in provision services, while functional diversity is equally important in regulation services. Plant root functional traits can not only help regulation services but also determine the species and structure of rhizosphere microbial communities. The response of ES to a certain factor has been extensively reviewed, but the interaction of multiple driving factors needs to be further studied, especially in how to drive the supply capacity of ES in multi-factor and multi-scale ways. Clarifying the driving mechanism of ES at different scales will help to improve the supply capacity of the ecosystem and achieve the goal of sustainable development.","[Kong, Lingwei; Xiong, Kangning; Zhang, Shihao; Deng, Xuehua] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Karst Sci, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China; [Kong, Lingwei; Xiong, Kangning; Zhang, Shihao; Deng, Xuehua] State Engn Technol Inst Karst Desertificat Control, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Tangshan Normal Univ, Dept Resource Management, Tangshan 063000, Peoples R China",Guizhou Normal University; Tangshan Normal University,"Xiong, KN (corresponding author), Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Karst Sci, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China.;Xiong, KN (corresponding author), State Engn Technol Inst Karst Desertificat Control, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China.",konglw@gznu.edu.cn; xiongkn@gznu.edu.cn,,"Xiong, Kangning/0000-0001-5762-0866; Zhang, Shihao/0000-0003-0984-9978",,,,NA,159,0,0,15,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,MAR,2023,14,3,,NA,,NA,,,582,10.3390/f14030582,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14030582,NA,,20,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,A5RQ0,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000955694700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Above-ground plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen (N) content and specific leaf area (SLA), have been shown to strongly relate to ecosystem productivity, respiration and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, increasing plant functional trait diversity has been suggested as a possible mechanism to increase ecosystem carbon (C) storage. However, it is uncertain whether below-ground plant traits can be predicted by above-ground traits, and if both above- and below-ground traits can be used to predict soil properties and ecosystem-level functions. Here, we used two adjacent field experiments in temperate grassland to investigate if above- and below-ground plant traits are related, and whether relationships between plant traits, soil properties and ecosystem C fluxes (i.e. ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange) measured in potted monocultures could be detected in mixed field communities. We found that certain shoot traits (e.g. shoot N and C, and leaf dry matter content) were related to root traits (e.g. root N, root C:N and root dry matter content) in monocultures, but such relationships were either weak or not detected in mixed communities. Some relationships between plant traits (i.e. shoot N, root N and/or shoot C:N) and soil properties (i.e. inorganic N availability and microbial community structure) were similar in monocultures and mixed communities, but they were more strongly linked to shoot traits in monocultures and root traits in mixed communities. Structural equation modelling showed that above- and below-ground traits and soil properties improved predictions of ecosystem C fluxes in monocultures, but not in mixed communities on the basis of community-weighted mean traits. Synthesis. Our results from a single grassland habitat detected relationships in monocultures between above- and below-ground plant traits, and between plant traits, soil properties and ecosystem C fluxes. However, these relationships were generally weaker or different in mixed communities. Our results demonstrate that while plant traits can be used to predict certain soil properties and ecosystem functions in monocultures, they are less effective for predicting how changes in plant species composition influence ecosystem functions in mixed communities.","[De Long, Jonathan R.; Wilkinson, Anna; Pritchard, William J.; Johnson, David; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [De Long, Jonathan R.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Jackson, Benjamin G.; Baggs, Elizabeth M.] Univ Edinburgh, Royal Dick Sch Vet Studies, Global Acad Agr & Food Secur, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Oakley, Simon; Mason, Kelly E.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bailrigg, England; [Stephan, Jorg G.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Ostle, Nicholas J.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Edinburgh; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University,"De Long, JR (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.;De Long, JR (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.",j.delong@nioo.knaw.nl,"Mason, Kelly E/K-7924-2013; Stephan, Jörg G./C-1618-2015; Ostle, Nick J/K-6891-2012; Johnson, David/N-3193-2013; De Long, Jonathan R/F-5681-2014; Ostle, Nicholas/E-4847-2014; Oakley, Simon/K-1857-2013","Mason, Kelly E/0000-0003-3426-3178; Stephan, Jörg G./0000-0001-6195-7867; Johnson, David/0000-0002-6724-1648; De Long, Jonathan R/0000-0002-7951-4818; Ostle, Nicholas/0000-0003-3263-3702; Baggs, Liz/0000-0003-2014-2148; Oakley, Simon/0000-0002-5757-7420; Johnson, David/0000-0003-2299-2525","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I009000/2]; N8 AgriFood programme; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/I009183/1, BB/I009183/2] Funding Source: researchfish; BBSRC [BB/I009183/1, BB/I008969/2, BB/I009183/2, BB/I009000/2, BB/I008969/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); N8 AgriFood programme; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, Grant/Award Number: BB/I009000/2; N8 AgriFood programme",NA,82,39,40,25,139,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Conventional plant functional types (cPFTs) based on a few productivity-related traits have been previously used to simplify and represent major differences in global plant functions, but more recent research has directly focused on the use of functional trait information. Still, sampling limitations have constrained efforts to truly understand the variance and covariance of functional traits globally. Reflectance spectra offer a fast, repeatable, simultaneous measurement of a wide variety of leaf functional traits and could be used to optically define leaf functional types. To evaluate this concept, we measured leaf reflectance from a wide range of species in a diverse set of ecosystems across central and northern California, including observations from multiple individuals, sites, and seasons. Using principal components analysis, we analyzed spectral variation in relation to categorical attributes such as species and cPFTs, as well as to a set of functional trait metrics calculated from the spectra. We found the first three principal components (PCs) to be weakly related to categorical attributes and more strongly related to spectrally-derived functional metrics. Each PC was more strongly associated with different portions of the spectrum and contained different functional information. We applied a hybrid clustering algorithm to the PC coordinates of the observations to define potential optical leaf functional types. Twelve spectral clusters were identified, and these did not correspond directly to either single cPFTs or species. However, each cluster had a unique functional metric profile. Clusters represented both inter- and intra-species and cPFT functional differences driven by taxonomy, trait evolution and environmental responses, demonstrating their value as optical leaf functional types and the value of the clustering approach used here for defining optical types from leaf spectra. Our findings support the notion that cPFTs do not adequately capture differences in leaf function. They demonstrate that spectral measurements can be used to improve both the definition of PFTs as well as our knowledge regarding the covariance of functional traits within these classes.

Trait-based approaches have the potential to target specific ecosystem services based on associations between the functional composition of plant communities and ecosystem properties that serve as indicators of those services. The effect of functional composition on ecosystem recovery may depend on the amount of restored plant biomass, itself a supporting service frequently targeted in restoration efforts. Yet, interactions between functional composition and biomass are not formally integrated into trait-based analytical frameworks. We tested the hypothesis that functional composition of plant communities both drives, and interacts with, biomass production to influence indicators of soil functioning and weed suppression across a network of degraded dryland restoration experiments. This networked approach allowed us to identify generalized effects of functional composition on ecosystem recovery across a range of dryland climate conditions. Climate had a substantial effect on ecosystem indicators, with weed cover and soil surface stability increasing in more arid climates, water infiltration increasing with precipitation, and aggregate structure increasing with less freezing. After accounting for climate effects across study sites, we found significant effects of community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values on biomass, particularly a positive effect of leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and of CWM-biomass interactions on other ecosystem indicators. Cover of exotic species was reduced in restored communities with a combination of low leaf dry matter content and high biomass, soil water infiltration increased with lower specific root length and high biomass, and soil aggregate stability increased with higher root dry matter content and high biomass, among other effects. Functional diversity had no significant effects on any ecosystem indicators. Synthesis: The influence of community functional composition on ecosystem properties increases with community biomass, particularly in disturbed or low productivity systems. This suggests that active management should not only focus on trait values that optimize individual ecosystem indicators but also how those functional strategies are complementary or counter to those that increase biomass.

However, few studies have examined how grazing intensity impacts ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) via biodiversity loss. We studied the responses of EMF to livestock grazing in a temperate grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. Four grazing intensities (i.e., no grazing (NG), light grazing (LG), moderate grazing (MG), and heavy grazing (HG)) were chosen based on the distance to the core zones, vegetation and soil indications of grazing, and suggestions from local guides. For each grazing intensity, three plots (10 m x 10 m) were placed randomly, and plants, soil, and four traits of the present species were sampled in three 1-m2 quadrats in each plot. We analyzed the responses of three biodiversity components (i.e., taxo-nomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD), and functional identity), multiple ecosystem functions (i.e., aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil water content, soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil total phosphorus, soil available nitrogen, soil available phos-phorus), and EMF (based on averaging approach and threshold-based approach) to different grazing intensities, and the relative importance of biodiversity components in regulating the ef-fect of grazing intensity on EMF. Our results showed that the dominant species of the plant community shifted from slow-growing conservative traits to fast-growing acquisitive traits as grazing intensified, accompanied by a decline in Stipa baicalensis (the predominant native grass in NG), whereas Carex duriuscula became the dominant species in HG sites. TD, FD, EMF, as well as six of eight individual ecosystem functions, displayed a significant decrease trend along the grazing intensity gradient. According to Bayesian structural equation models (SEM), EMF was mainly driven by the indirect effects of grazing through TD reduction (direct effects: 0.45) and changes in functional identity (direct effects: -0.67), but the direct effect of grazing was not significant. By using the threshold-based approach, we found TD, FD, and CWM have a prominent impact on the number of functions exceeding a threshold level of 63 %, 64 %, and 65 %, respectively. When the threshold increased to 90 %, the explanation of the SEM decreased to 41 %, and no significant direct and indirect effects of grazing on EMF were found. Our results highlighted the vital role of biodiversity in mediating the response of EMF to grazing and shed light on grassland biodiversity conservation and sustainability.","[Sheng, Zhilu; Du, Jiaqiang; Li, Lijuan; Sun, Bingqing; Mao, Jialin; Zhang, Yangchengsi; Zhang, Jing; Diao, Zhaoyan] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Zhilu; Du, Jiaqiang; Li, Lijuan; Sun, Bingqing; Mao, Jialin; Zhang, Yangchengsi; Zhang, Jing; Diao, Zhaoyan] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Protect Reg Ecol Proc & Fun, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Zhilu; Du, Jiaqiang; Li, Lijuan; Sun, Bingqing; Mao, Jialin; Zhang, Yangchengsi; Zhang, Jing; Diao, Zhaoyan] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Li, Engui] Beijing Municipal Res Inst Ecoenvironm Protect, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences,"Du, JQ (corresponding author), Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.",shengzhilu@yeah.net; dujq@craes.org.cn; lilijuan0917@163.com; liengui8908@163.com; sunbingqing20@mails.ucas.ac.cn; maojl20@lzu.edu.cn; zhangyangchengsi@webmail.hzau.edu.cn; zhj19@lzu.edu.cn; diaozhy@126.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFC1806305]; National Environmental Protection Hulunber Forest-Steppe Ecotone Observation and Research Station,National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Environmental Protection Hulunber Forest-Steppe Ecotone Observation and Research Station,Acknowledgements This research was supported by The National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant no. 2020YFC1806305) .

Here, using a tree biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment, we provide strong support for the hypothesis that leaf bacterial diversity is positively linked to ecosystem productivity, even after accounting for the role of plant diversity. Our results also show that host species identity, functional identity and functional diversity are the main determinants of leaf bacterial community structure and diversity.

Several studies have demonstrated the potential for variation in AM fungal diversity to also affect ecosystem functioning, mainly via effects on primary productivity. Diversity in these studies is usually characterized in terms of the number of species, unique evolutionary lineages or complementary mycorrhizal traits, as well as the ability of plants to discriminate among AM fungi in space and time. However, the emergent outcomes of these relationships are usually indirect, and thus context dependent, and difficult to predict with certainty. Here, we advocate a fungal-centric view of AM fungal biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships that focuses on the direct and specific links between AM fungal fitness and consequences for their roles in ecosystems, especially highlighting functional diversity in hyphal resource economics. We conclude by arguing that an understanding of AM fungal functional diversity is fundamental to determine whether AM fungi have a role in the exploitation of marginal/novel environments (whether past, present or future) and highlight avenues for future research.","[Powell, Jeff R.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Rillig, Matthias C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Rillig, Matthias C.] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Western Sydney University; Free University of Berlin,"Powell, JR (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.;Rillig, MC (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.;Rillig, MC (corresponding author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jeff.powell@westernsydney.edu.au; rillig@zedat.fu-berlin.de,"Powell, Jeff R/A-5076-2010; Rillig, Matthias C./AAE-6980-2019; Rillig, Matthias C./B-3675-2009","Powell, Jeff R/0000-0003-1091-2452; Rillig, Matthias C./0000-0003-3541-7853; Rillig, Matthias C./0000-0003-3541-7853","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) initiative 'BonaRes -Soil as a sustainable resource for the bioeconomy'; BMBF; European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant 'Gradual_Change'; Australian Research Council [DP140103936, DP160103765]",Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) initiative 'BonaRes -Soil as a sustainable resource for the bioeconomy'(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BMBF(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant 'Gradual_Change'(European Research Council (ERC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"M.C.R. acknowledges funding by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) initiative 'BonaRes -Soil as a sustainable resource for the bioeconomy' for the projects INPLAMINT and Soil 3, as well as BMBF funding for the project 'Bridging in Biodiversity Science (BIBS)' and the European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant 'Gradual_Change'.

We constructed a series of generalized additive mixed models and piecewise structural equation modeling to determine how trait variability (i.e. TVinter, ITVwithin, CWMfixed and ITVamong) indirectly mediated the changes in productivity in response to functional group removal. Community productivity was not only affected directly by treatment manipulations, but also increased with both inter- and intraspecific variability (i.e. CWMfixed and ITVamong) in plant height indirectly. This suggests that both the 'selection effect' and a 'shade-avoidance syndrome' can incur higher CWMfixed and ITVamong, and may simultaneously operate to regulate productivity. Our findings provide new evidence that, besides interspecific variability, intraspecific trait variability in plant height also plays a role in maintaining net primary productivity.","[Zhang, Li] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiang] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, State Key Lab Grassland Ago Ecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shurong] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Minist Educ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Shipley, Bill] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Anhui Agricultural University; Lanzhou University; Hainan University; University of Sherbrooke,"Zhou, SR (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry, Minist Educ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",zhshrong@hainanu.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiang/A-4154-2017","Liu, Xiang/0000-0003-3914-5824; Shipley, Bill/0000-0002-7026-3880","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770518, 31830009]; Hainan University [RZ2000009932]; China Scholarship Council scholarship; Anhui Agricultural University [rc522108]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University; China Scholarship Council scholarship(China Scholarship Council); Anhui Agricultural University,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770518 and 31830009), and Hainan University (RZ2000009932) to Shurong Zhou, Anhui Agricultural University (rc522108) and a China Scholarship Council scholarship to Li Zhang.",NA,48,1,1,16,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

However, the question concerning how tree compositions and their interactions with other abiotic factors modulate soil's water-physical properties in disturbed forests remains poorly understood. Based on observational data from nine permanent forest sites (18,747 trees and 210 plots) in the northeast of China, where forests once undergone three different levels of anthropogenic logging disturbance, we evaluated how multiple biotic (i.e., tree diversity and functional trait composition) and abiotic (soil texture and soil organic carbon) factors influence water-physical properties (i.e., in terms of soil capillary water retention (WC) and soil saturated water retention (WS)) in temperate forests. We found that the impacts of logging disturbance on soil water-physical properties were associated with improved tree diversity, acquisitive functional traits, and SOC. These associated attributes were also positively related to WC and WS, while there was no significant effect from soil texture. Moreover, disturbance indirectly affected soil water-physical properties mainly by functional traits and SOC, as acquisitive functional traits significantly mediate the effect from disturbance on WC and SOC mediates the influence from disturbance on WS. Finally, our results emphasize the potential relationships of tree composition with SOC and soil water retention as compared with soil texture and hence suggest that plants can actively modulate their abiotic contexts after disturbance, which is meaningful for understanding forest health and resistance.","[Liu, Shufang; Yuan, Zuoqiang; Sanaei, Anvar; Mao, Zikun; Zheng, Di; Fang, Shuai; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Wang, Xugao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shufang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arshad] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Forest Ecol Res Grp, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China; [Ding, Fan; Jia, Zhaojie; Tao, Zhao] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Land & Environm, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China; [Hao, Zhanqing] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Xian 710129, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Hebei University; Shenyang Agricultural University; Northwestern Polytechnical University","Hao, ZQ (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Xian 710129, Peoples R China.",liushufang15@mails.ucas.ac.cn; zgyuan@iae.ac.cn; arshadforester@gmail.com; anvarsour@alumni.ut.ac.ir; maozikun15@126.com; dingfan1985@hotmail.com; zhengdi18@mails.ucas.ac.cn; fangs5@126.com; Zhaojie_jia@163.com; taozhao85@163.com; linfei@iae.ac.cn; yeji1011@163.com; wangxg@iae.ac.cn; hzq@iae.ac.cn,"Ali, Arshad/HOC-3353-2023; Ding, Fan/A-3049-2015; Ali, Arshad/G-3988-2014","Ding, Fan/0000-0002-7938-1015; Ali, Arshad/0000-0001-9966-2917; , Anvar/0000-0001-8334-6944; Mao, Zikun/0000-0002-7035-9129","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31730015, 31670632, 32171581]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China [2021-MS-028]; Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security of Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education of China [GPES202001]; Kwan Cheng Wong Education Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province); Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security of Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education of China; Kwan Cheng Wong Education Foundation","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31730015, 31670632, 32171581), Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China (2021-MS-028), Key Laboratory of Geographical Processes and Ecological Security of Changbai Mountains, Ministry of Education of China (GPES202001), and the Kwan Cheng Wong Education Foundation.",NA,66,1,1,9,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,NOV,2021,12,11,,NA,,NA,,,1588,10.3390/f12111588,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12111588,NA,,12,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,ZD4GQ,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000758158300010,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,não,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ecological theory and few observation studies indicate that trees with acquisitive functional traits would respond more strongly to higher resource availability than those with conservative traits. We assessed how long-term tree growth in experimental nutrient addition plots (N, P, and N + P) varied as a function of morphological traits, tree size, and species identity. We also evaluated how trait-based responses affected stand scale biomass production considering the community structure. We found that tree growth depended on interactions between functional traits and the type or combination of nutrients added. Common species with acquisitive functional traits responded more strongly to nutrient addition, mainly to N + P. Phosphorous enhanced the growth rates of species with acquisitive and conservative traits, had mostly positive effects on common species and neutral or negative effects in rare species. Moreover, trees receiving N + P grew faster irrespective of their initial size relative to trees in control or to trees in other treatment plots. Finally, species responses were highly idiosyncratic suggesting that community processes including competition and niche dimensionality may be altered under increased resource availability. We found no statistically significant effects of nutrient additions on aboveground biomass productivity because acquisitive species had a limited potential to increase their biomass, possibly due to their generally lower wood density. In contrast, P addition increased the growth rates of species characterized by more conservative resource strategies (with higher wood density) that were poorly represented in the plant community. We provide the first long-term experimental evidence that trait-based responses, community structure, and community processes modulate the effects of increased nutrient availability on biomass productivity in a tropical forest.","[Baez, Selene] Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Quito, Ecuador; [Baez, Selene] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Museo Colecc Biol, Loja, Ecuador; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Plant Ecol, Gottingen, Germany",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador; Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja; University of Gottingen,"Baez, S (corresponding author), Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Quito, Ecuador.",selene.baez@epn.edu.ec,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Baez, Selene/0000-0002-7236-6242","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4]; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst [91587171]","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","Secretaria de Educacion Superior, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4; Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, Grant/Award Number: 91587171",NA,53,40,44,12,118,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We use the continuous trait-based modelling approach, which assumes infinite richness and represents diversity in terms of the variance of the size distribution, to investigate the effects of phytoplankton size diversity on productivity in a three-dimensional ocean circulation model driven by realistic physics forcing. We find a slightly negative effect of size diversity on primary production, which we attribute to several factors including functional trait-environment interactions, flexible stoichiometry and the saturation of productivity at low diversity levels. The benefits of trait optimisation, whereby narrow size distributions enhance productivity under relatively stable conditions, tend to dominate over those of adaptive capacity, whereby greater diversity enhances the ability of the community to respond to environmental variability.","[Chen, Bingzhang; Smith, Sherwood Lan] JAMSTEC Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Global Change Res, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Wirtz, Kai W.] Helmholtz Ctr Coastal & Mat Res HZG, Geesthacht, Germany",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC),"Chen, BZ (corresponding author), JAMSTEC Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Global Change Res, Kanazawa Ku, 3173-25 Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",bingzhang.chen@gmail.com,"Wirtz, Kai/GRY-5339-2022; Chen, Bingzhang/AAH-6784-2020; Smith, Sherwood Lan/D-2493-2012","Chen, Bingzhang/0000-0002-1573-7473; Smith, Sherwood Lan/0000-0002-2338-5893",CREST - Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency [JPMJCR12A3]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [JP16K21701]; Helmholtz Society via the program PACES; German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program DYNA-TRAIT,"CREST - Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Helmholtz Society via the program PACES; German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Program DYNA-TRAIT","We thank S.

Recent studies have revealed that the variations in terrestrial ecosystem functions are captured by three key axes: the maximum productivity, water use efficiency, and carbon use efficiency of the ecosystem. However, the role of biodiversity in supporting these three key axes has not yet been explored. In this study, we combined the (i) data collected from more than 840 vegetation plots across a large climatic gradient in China using standard protocols, (ii) data on plant traits and phylogenetic information for more than 2,500 plant species, and (iii) soil nutrient data measured in each plot. These data were used to systematically assess the contribution of environmental factors, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and community-weighted mean (CWM) and ecosystem traits (i.e., traits intensity normalized per unit land area) to EMF via hierarchical partitioning and Bayesian structural equation modeling. Multiple biodiversity attributes accounted for 70% of the influence of all the variables on EMF, and ecosystems with high functional diversity had high resource use efficiency. Our study is the first to systematically explore the role of different biodiversity attributes, including species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity, and CWM and ecosystem traits, in the key axes of ecosystem functions. Our findings underscore that biodiversity conservation is critical for sustaining EMF and ultimately ensuring human well-being.","[Yan, Pu; Yu, Guirui; He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; He, Nianpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Pu; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos] CREAF, E-08193 Catalonia, Spain; [Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci, BEECA UB, Barcelona, Spain; [Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, KU Leuven Plant Inst, Leuven, Belgium; [Migliavacca, Mirco] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Integrat, Jena, Germany; [Migliavacca, Mirco] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [He, Nianpeng] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin, Peoples R China; [He, Nianpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Earth Crit Zone & Flux Res Stn Xingan Mt, Daxinganling, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; KU Leuven; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); University of Barcelona; KU Leuven; Max Planck Society; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Northeast Forestry University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences","He, NP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",henp@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Martínez, Marcos Fernández/I-7240-2012; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/A-9072-2011","Martínez, Marcos Fernández/0000-0002-5661-3610; Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/0000-0002-9260-3815; he, nianpeng/0000-0002-0458-5953",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31988102]; CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research [YSBR-037]; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China [2019FY101300]; la Caixa Foundation [100010434],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China; la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31988102; National Science and Technology Basic Resources Survey Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2019FY101300; the fellowship from 'la Caixa' Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 100010434; CAS Project for Young Scientists in basic Research, Grant/Award Number: YSBR-037",NA,100,1,1,67,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Permafrost thaw leads to thickening of the active (seasonally thawed) layer and alters nutrient and light availability. These physical changes may influence community-level plant functional traits through intraspecific trait variation and/or species turnover. As permafrost thaw is expected to cause an efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from the soil to the atmosphere, it is important to understand thaw-induced changes in plant community productivity to evaluate whether these changes may offset some of the anticipated increases in C emissions. To this end, we collected vascular plant community composition and foliar functional trait data along gradients in aboveground tree biomass and active layer thickness (ALT) in a rapidly thawing boreal peatland, with the expectation that changes in above- and belowground conditions are indicative of altered resource availability. We aimed to determine whether community-level traits vary across these gradients, and whether these changes are dominated by intraspecific trait variation, species turnover, or both. Our results highlight that variability in community-level traits was largely attributable to species turnover and that both community composition and traits were predominantly driven by ALT. Specifically, thicker active layers associated with permafrost-free peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens) shifted community composition from slower-growing evergreen shrubs to faster-growing graminoids and forbs with a corresponding shift toward more productive trait values. The results from this rapidly thawing peatland suggest that continued warming-induced permafrost thaw and thermokarst development alter plant community composition and community-level traits and thus ecosystem productivity. Increased productivity may help to mitigate anticipated CO2 efflux from thawing permafrost, at least in the short term, though this response may be swamped by increase CH4 release.","[Standen, Katherine M.; Baltzer, Jennifer L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Baltzer, JL (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Biol, 75 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",jbaltzer@wlu.ca,,"Standen, Katherine Marie/0000-0003-0370-2027",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Canada Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR); Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; Northern Scientific Training Program; Global Water Futures,NA,68,4,5,6,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Compared with remotely sensed mapping of forest biodiversity, that of grassland plant diversity has been less studied, because of the small size of individual grass species and the inherent difficulty in identifying these species. The technological advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based or proximal imaging spectroscopy with high spatial resolution provide new approaches for mapping and assessing grassland plant diversity based on spectral diversity and functional trait diversity. However, relatively few studies have explored the relationships among spectral diversity, remote-sensing-estimated functional trait diversity, and species diversity in grassland ecosystems. In this study, we examined the links among spectral diversity, functional trait diversity, and species diversity in a semi-arid grassland monoculture experimental site. The results showed that (1) different grassland plant species harbored different functional traits or trait combinations (functional trait diversity), leading to different spectral patterns (spectral diversity). (2) The spectral diversity of grassland plant species increased gradually from the visible (VIR, 400-700 nm) to the near-infrared (NIR, 700-1100 nm) region, and to the short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1100-2400 nm) region. (3) As the species richness increased, the functional traits and spectral diversity increased in a nonlinear manner, finally tending to saturate. (4) Grassland plant species diversity could be accurately predicted using hyperspectral data (R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001) and remotely sensed functional traits (R-2 = 0.66, p < 0.001) using cluster algorithms. This will enhance our understanding of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functions and support regional grassland biodiversity conservation.","[Zhao, Yujin; Sun, Yihan; Chen, Wenhe; Zhao, Yanping; Liu, Xiaoliang; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yihan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bai, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.;Bai, YF (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhaoyj@ibcas.ac.cn; sunyh.20b@igsnrr.ac.cn; chenwenhe@ibcas.ac.cn; zyp150526@st.btbu.edu.cn; liuxiaoliang@lreis.ac.cn; yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"zhao, yan/GWC-9174-2022","Sun, Yihan/0000-0002-0509-1330; Zhao, Yujin/0000-0003-0225-6491",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23080303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801230],Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by grants from the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23080303) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41801230).,NA,79,5,7,34,129,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2021,13,15,,NA,,NA,,,3034,10.3390/rs13153034,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13153034,NA,,18,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,TW1YS,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000682205300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,não,sim,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bryophytes respond to environmental changes at the species level, but because bryophyte species are relatively difficult to identify, they are often lumped into one functional group. Consequently, bryophyte function remains poorly resolved. Here, we explore how higher resolution of bryophyte functional diversity can be encouraged and implemented in tundra ecological studies. We briefly review previous bryophyte functional classifications and the roles of bryophytes in tundra ecosystems and their susceptibility to environmental change. Based on shoot morphology and colony organization, we then propose twelve easily distinguishable bryophyte functional groups. To illustrate how bryophyte functional groups can help elucidate variation in bryophyte effects and responses, we compiled existing data on water holding capacity, a key bryophyte trait. Although plant functional groups can mask potentially high interspecific and intraspecific variability, we found better separation of bryophyte functional group means compared with previous grouping systems regarding water holding capacity. This suggests that our bryophyte functional groups truly represent variation in the functional roles of bryophytes in tundra ecosystems. Lastly, we provide recommendations to improve the monitoring of bryophyte community changes in tundra study sites.","[Lett, Signe; Christiansen, Casper T.; Ekelund, Flemming; Michelsen, Anders; Rousk, Kathrin; Rzepczynska, Agnieszka M.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg S.] Univ Iceland, Inst Life & Environm Sci, Sturlugata 7, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Becker-Scarpitta, Antoine] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Spatial Food Web Ecol Grp, POB 27 Viikinkaari, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Becker-Scarpitta, Antoine] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Res Ctr Ecol Change, POB 27 Viikinkaari, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Christiansen, Casper T.; Michelsen, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [During, Heinjo] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol Ecol & Biodivers, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Henry, Gregory H.

However, experimental evidence of compensatory processes that buffer productivity declines in relation to environmental stress is limited, especially in below-ground settings. We asked whether species richness could stabilize productivity under warming via compensatory responses in root biomass and root functional traits. Methods Using three herbaceous species, we created plant communities composed of four individuals in either monocultures or two- and three-species assemblages. We grew them at three temperatures, simulating current climate conditions, moderate warming and severe warming, respectively. We built mixed-linear mixed models to model plant productivity by species richness and warming and we also analyzed the interactive roles of species richness and warming in species interaction and root functional traits. Results We found that warming reduced both above- and below-ground productivity and shifted the biodiversity-productivity relationship from negative to positive. Productivity reductions were weaker in richer species combinations. Warming ameliorated the strength of interspecific competition below-ground in mixed-species communities by reducing the root biomass of strong competitors, which benefitted root growth of weaker competitors. Conclusions Our results suggest warming can facilitate compensatory responses in herbaceous root productivity across species competition hierarchies. These compensatory processes by which species richness stabilizes plant community functioning emphasize the importance that plant functional diversity has in maintaining ecosystem functioning with climate change.","Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zihui] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hogan, J.

Spatially explicit data of plant functional traits and diversity are essential for understanding biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here we retrieved three morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index, foliage height diversity) and three physiological traits (chlorophyll a + b content, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness) from airborne laser scanning and multispectral Sentinel-2 data, respectively. We found airborne LiDAR-derived parameters corre-lated well with in-situ plot-level morphological data (R2 >= 0.67). For satellite-derived physiological traits, partial least squares regression (PLSR) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.26-0.43, cross-validation with in -situ community-weighted mean (CWM) leaf physiological trait data) than a vegetation index (VI) approach. The remotely-sensed traits were used as input to estimate multi-trait functional diversity (FD) indices in a species-rich subtropical mountainous forest. Finally, we investigated the influence of single-trait CWMs, multi-trait FD indices and environmental variables on remotely-derived aboveground ecosystem carbon stocks (aboveground biomass, AGB) and primary productivity (kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). CWMs of all functional traits were significant predictors of AGB and kNDVI, as suggested by the mass-ratio hypothesis. Morphological FD indices were also important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, indicating effects of complementarity in crown architectures. In best-fit multivariate models, the first principal component CWM of morphological traits and that of physiological traits were the most important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, respectively. The FD index of morphological richness was additionally selected in the best-fit models for AGB and kNDVI at ecosystem and landscape scales. Our work highlights the potential of using remotely-sensed functional traits to assess the relationship between trait diversity and ecosystem functioning across large, contiguous areas.","[Zheng, Zhaoju; Schmid, Bernhard; Schuman, Meredith C.; Schaepman, Michael E.; Morsdorf, Felix] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Zheng, Zhaoju; Zeng, Yuan; Zhao, Dan] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yuan; Zhao, Dan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","University of Zurich; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Zeng, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zengyuan@aircas.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071344]; Joint CAS-MPG Research Project [HZXM20225001MI]; University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB); China Scholarship Council [201704910941],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Joint CAS-MPG Research Project; University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity (URPP GCB); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42071344) and the Joint CAS-MPG Research Project (No. HZXM20225001MI) .

The results showed that, for both D. angustifolia and G. spiculosa, N addition generally increased plant height, leaf, stem and total aboveground biomass, but did not cause changes in SLA and LDMC. Moreover, increased N availability caused an increase in LNC, and did not affect LPC. Thus, N addition decreased leaf C:N ratio, but caused an increase in leaf N:P ratio, and did not affect leaf C:P ratio. Our results suggest that, in the mid-term, elevated N loading does not alter leaf morphological traits, but causes substantial changes in whole-plant traits and leaf chemical traits in temperate freshwater wetlands. These may help to better understand the effects of N enrichment on plant functional traits and thus ecosystem structure and functioning in freshwater wetlands.","[Mao Rong; Zhang Xinhou; Song Changchun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Mao Rong] Minist Land & Resources China, Key Lab Marine Hydrocarbon Resources & Environm G, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China","Mao, R (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",maorong@neigae.ac.cn,"Mao, Rong/Q-2595-2019; Mao, Rong/F-1424-2017","Mao, Rong/0000-0002-0469-2281; ","Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050508]; Ministry of Land and Resources Program Key Laboratory of Marine Hydrocarbon Resources and Environmental Geology, Ministry of Land and Resources [201111023, GZH201100203, MRE201101]","Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ministry of Land and Resources Program Key Laboratory of Marine Hydrocarbon Resources and Environmental Geology, Ministry of Land and Resources","Foundation item: Under the auspices of Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Related Issues of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA05050508), Ministry of Land and Resources Program (No. 201111023, GZH201100203) Key Laboratory of Marine Hydrocarbon Resources and Environmental Geology, Ministry of Land and Resources (No. MRE201101)",NA,42,17,28,6,92,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

However, few studies have used an experiment designed to disentangle the role of the mechanisms proposed by these hypotheses. This is especially true regarding the role of leaf functional traits for decomposition rates in tropical ecosystems. Here, we quantified the biomass loss of 120 leaf mixtures assembled according to four quasi-orthogonal combinations of different mean trait values (community-weighted mean; CWM) and trait variability (functional diversity; FD) of three leaf functional traits (leaf nitrogen and leaf magnesium concentrations and specific leaf area). We found that CWM values of leaf nutritional traits were positively related to greater biomass loss. This supports the hypothesis that the mean trait values of leaf mixtures can drive biomass loss (MRH). However, contrary to NCH expectations, in some circumstances, increasing trait variability of leaf nutritional traits decreased biomass loss. Our results reinforce some previous evidence that, together, CWM and FD can explain leaf decomposition and highlight that the mean resource quality of leaf mixtures is a driver of biomass loss. Also, as previously reported for temperate ecosystems, trait variability does not always increase leaf decomposition in tropical ecosystems. Therefore, there is a need to consider simultaneously both MRH and NCH in future studies, using an appropriate design, keeping in mind that both mechanisms will always be present in any species mixture or combination.","[Plazas-Jimenez, Daniel] Univ Fed Goias, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Cianciaruso, Marcus V.] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Goias; Universidade Federal de Goias,"Plazas-Jimenez, D (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Goiania, Go, Brazil.",plazas.jimenezd@gmail.com,"Cianciaruso, Marcus V/B-9509-2012; Plazas-Jiménez, Daniel/B-3734-2019","Cianciaruso, Marcus V/0000-0001-5866-5345; Plazas-Jiménez, Daniel/0000-0003-3829-3112",PELD Sitio 13 (CNPq/CAPES/FAPEG); OAS; GCUB; CNPq [306590/2018-2]; MCTIC/CNPq [465610/2014-5]; FAPEG,PELD Sitio 13 (CNPq/CAPES/FAPEG); OAS; GCUB; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); MCTIC/CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Goias (FAPEG)),"Our study was funded by PELD Sitio 13 (CNPq/CAPES/FAPEG).

Functional diversity of plant traits links ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This work presents an approach to map and quantify functional diversity of physiological forest traits derived from 20 m Sentinel-2 data in a temperate forest ecosystem. We used two complementary data sources, namely high-resolution, as well as spatially resampled airborne imaging spectroscopy data and Sentinel-2 data, to ensure our methods support consistently mapping functional diversity from space. We retrieved three physiological traits related to forest health, stress, and potential productivity, namely chlorophyll, carotenoid, and water content, from airborne imaging spectroscopy and Sentinel-2 data using corresponding spectral indices as proxies. We analyzed changes in two functional diversity metrics, namely functional richness and divergence, at different spatial resolutions. Both functional diversity metrics depend on the size and number of pixels to derive functional diversity as a function of distance, leading to different interpretations. When mapping functional diversity using Sentinel-2 data, small-scale patterns <1.1 ha were no longer visible, implying a minimum calculation area with 60 m radius recommended for retrieval of functional diversity metrics. The spectrally convolved and spatially resampled airborne spectroscopy data and the native Sentinel-2 data were correlated with r = 0.747 for functional richness and r = 0.709 for divergence in a 3.1 ha neighborhood. Functional richness was more affected by the differences in trait maps between the acquisitions resulting from effects in illumination and topography compared with functional divergence. Further differences could be explained by varying illumination/observation effects and phenological status of the vegetation at acquisition. Our approach demonstrates the importance of spatial and spectral resolution when scaling diversity assessments from regional to continental scales.","[Helfenstein, Isabelle S.; Schaepman, Michael E.; Morsdorf, Felix] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Fabian D.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91011 USA",University of Zurich; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Helfenstein, IS (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",isabelle.helfenstein@geo.uzh.ch,"Schaepman, Michael/HPC-6857-2023; Helfenstein, Isabelle/GVT-8005-2022","Helfenstein, Isabelle Salome/0000-0001-7089-5768; Morsdorf, Felix/0000-0001-6713-1599",NOMIS Foundation; University Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich (URPP GCB); National Aeronautics and Space Administration [80NM0018D0004]; Government sponsorship,NOMIS Foundation; University Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich (URPP GCB); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Government sponsorship,"This study was supported by the NOMIS Foundation and the University Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity of the University of Zurich (URPP GCB) .

Higher plant biodiversity can enhance ecosystem resistance to drought; however, the potential effects of drought on the relationships between above-ground productivity (ANPP) and biodiversity along a natural aridity gradient remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the effects of experimental drought on plant community structure and ANPP during the two different dry years (2015 and 2017) spanning three temperate steppe sites with low-, medium- and high-aridity levels. We also examined the effects of drought and aridity on the associations of plant species (richness and abundance), functional (community-weighted trait means and functional dispersion) and phylogenetic diversity (evolutionary lineages) with ANPP. A structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to elucidate how the drought affected ANPP by altering biodiversity attributes. We found that experimental drought shaped the biodiversity-ANPP relationships, and the biodiversity-ANPP relationships differed among three sites. At the low-aridity site, ANPP was correlated with plant functional traits, whereas ANPP was correlated with functional dispersion, species and phylogenetic diversity at the medium-aridity site. At the high-aridity site, ANPP was correlated with species richness, functional traits and phylogenetic diversity. Compared with 2015, natural drought in 2017 strengthened the associations of species diversity, functional dispersion, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content with ANPP across three sites. SEM further showed that both experimental and natural drought directly decreased ANPP and indirectly decreased ANPP by reducing community-weighted mean of plant height. Synthesis. These results suggest that the aridity increase or drought occurrence is likely to induce the shifts in the associations of ANPP with species and functional diversity, highlighting the important role of water availability or precipitation conditions in regulating the biodiversity-ANPP relationships in temperate steppes. Overall, functional traits related to plant size play a crucial role in modulating the response of productivity to drought across three steppe sites. Thus, to buffer the negative effects of drought on steppe ANPP should pay attention to protect the species with large plant size.

It can influence ecosystem processes and stability. Hence, it is important to understand how and why FD varies within and between ecosystems, along resources availability gradients and climate gradients, and across vegetation successional stages. Usually, FD is assessed through labor-intensive field measurements, while assessing FD from space may provide a way to monitor global FD changes in a consistent, time and resource efficient way. The potential of operational satellites for inferring FD, however, remains to be demonstrated. Here we studied the relationships between FD and spectral reflectance measurements taken by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite over 117 field plots located in 6 European countries, with 46 plots having in-situ sampled leaf traits and the other 71 using traits from the TRY database. These field plots represent major European forest types, from boreal forests in Finland to Mediterranean mixed forests in Spain. Based on in-situ data collected in 2013 we computed functional dispersion (FDis), a measure of FD, using foliar and whole-plant traits of known ecological significance. These included five foliar traits: leaf nitrogen concentration (N%), leaf carbon concentration (%C), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area (LA). In addition they included three whole-plant traits: tree height (H), crown cross-sectional area (CCSA), and diameter-at-breast-height (DBH). We applied partial least squares regression using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance measured in 2015 as predictive variables to model in-situ FDis measurements. We predicted, in cross-validation, 55% of the variation in the observed FDis. We also showed that the rededge, near infrared and shortwave infrared regions of Sentinel-2 are more important than the visible region for predicting FDis. An initial 30-m resolution mapping of FDis revealed large local FDis variation within each forest type. The novelty of this study is the effective integration of spaceborne and in-situ measurements at a continental scale, and hence represents a key step towards achieving rapid global biodiversity monitoring schemes.","[Ma, Xuanlong;

Here, we identified plant species of high importance for productivity (key species) in >29,000 diverse grassland communities in the European Alps, and compared their effects with those of community-level measures of functional composition (weighted means, variances, skewness and kurtosis). After accounting for the environment, the five most important key species jointly explained more deviance of productivity than any measure of functional composition alone. Key species were generally tall with high specific leaf areas. By dividing the observations according to distinct habitats, the explanatory power of key species and functional composition increased and key-species plant types and functional composition-productivity relationships varied systematically, presumably because of changing interactions and trade-offs between traits. Our results advocate for a careful consideration of species' individual effects on ecosystem functioning in complement to community-level measures.","[Brun, Philipp; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Brun, Philipp; Munkemuller, Tamara; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, LECA, CNRS, Grenoble, France; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS, CEFE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Mouillot, David; Mouquet, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, UMR MARBEC 9190, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier 5, France; [Mouillot, David] Inst Univ France, IUF, Paris, France; [Mouquet, Nicolas] CESAB FRB, Montpellier, France; [Enquist, Brian J.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Interdisciplinaire Phys, St Mar Tin Dheres, France; [Ostling, Annette] Univ Texas Austin, Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Institut Universitaire de France; University of Arizona; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Brun, P (corresponding author), Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",philipp.brun@wsl.ch,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./A-4276-2008; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Zimmermann, Niklaus E./0000-0003-3099-9604; MOUQUET, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [1003A_149508, 310030L_170059]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LAB-56, ANR-15-IDEX-02]; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 1003A_149508 and 310030L_170059; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-LAB-56 and ANR-15-IDEX-02; Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite",NA,60,12,13,15,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Globally, anthropogenic changes to water regimes are impacting the health and distribution of riparian trees. Understanding the physiological constraints on the distribution of riparian tree species in relation to the water regime is essential for informed water resource management that seeks to limit impacts on riparian trees. To fill an identified knowledge gap for the Fitzroy River, a significant river in the wet-dry tropics of north-western Australia, we used a trait-based approach to characterise nine common riparian tree species in relation to their distribution along a hydrological gradient. We assessed key functional traits related to drought and flood flows. Leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), foliar carbon content (% C) and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) are broadly related to plant productivity and durability and may reflect resistance to fluvial stress. Traits related to water availability were stem specific density (SSD), mean xylem vessel diameter and xylem vessel density, as well as foliar delta C-13 which is related to water use efficiency, and leaf osmotic potential at full hydration (pi(100)) as a measure of drought tolerance. We found that pi(100), delta C-13 and SSD values reflected species hydrological habitat preferences, with higher delta C-13 values and lower pi(100) for species distributed in the drier floodplain habitats, compared with species constrained to the riverbank. Low SSD values for species close to the riverbank may be indicative of aerenchyma tissue in response to flooding. Differences in leaf trait values were primarily attributed to differences between evergreen Myrtaceous and deciduous non-Myrtaceous species, rather than hydrological habitat preferences. LMA was greatest for the Myrtaceous study species, with deciduous non-Myrtaceous species associated with wetter habitats having the lowest values. The physiology of riparian trees in northern Australia is not well described for the majority of species. Our study provides insight into plant functional strategies in response to both flooding and drought and is a critical step in understanding plant responses to future water-take scenarios to support evidence-based decision making.","[Canham, Caroline A.; Setterfield, Samantha A.; Freestone, Fiona L.; Beesley, Leah S.; Douglas, Michael M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Woods, Calum; Veneklaas, Erik J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Canham, CA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Environm, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",caroline.canham@uwa.edu.au,"Douglas, Michael M/I-3149-2012","Douglas, Michael M/0000-0003-3650-3374; Setterfield, Samantha/0000-0002-7470-4997; Veneklaas, Erik/0000-0002-7030-4056",Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program,Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program(Australian Government),Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program,NA,80,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,JAN,2023,16,1,,NA,,NA,,,,10.1002/eco.2488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2488,NA,OCT 2022,12,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,7X2GV,NA,hybrid,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000868559000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,não,sim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate how distinct species affect ecosystem productivity, we used a forest-gap model to simulate realistic temperate forest successions along an environmental gradient and measured ecosystem productivity at the end of the successional trajectories. We performed 10 560 simulations with different sets and numbers of species, bearing either distinct or indistinct functional traits, and compared them to random assemblages, to mimic the consequences of a regional loss of species. Long-term ecosystem productivity dropped when distinct species were lost first from the regional pool of species, under the harshest environmental conditions. On the contrary, productivity was more dependent on ordinary species in milder environments. Our findings show that species functional distinctiveness, integrating multiple trait dimensions, can capture species-specific effects on ecosystem productivity. In a context of an environmentally changing world, they highlight the need to investigate the role of distinct species in sustaining ecosystem processes, particularly in extreme environmental conditions.","[Delalandre, Leo; Morin, Xavier; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France; [Gauzere, Pierre; Thuiller, Wilfried] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Lab Ecol Alpine, CNRS,LECA, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Cadotte, Marc] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mouquet, Nicolas; Mouillot, David; Loiseau, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Mouquet, Nicolas] FRB CESAB, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LiPhy, CNRS, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Denelle, Pierre] Univ Goettingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Gottingen,"Delalandre, L (corresponding author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS,IRD,CEFE, Montpellier, France.",leo.delalandre@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Morin, Xavier/B-2790-2015; MOUQUET, Nicolas/AAL-1440-2021","Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Morin, Xavier/0000-0003-1961-8700; MOUQUET, Nicolas/0000-0003-1840-6984; Delalandre, Leo/0000-0003-2875-4587; Mouillot, David/0000-0003-0402-2605",Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); Electricite de France (EDF); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plants' [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; BACI [640176],Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB); Electricite de France (EDF)(Electricite de France (EDF)); European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project Ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plants'(European Research Council (ERC)); DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; BACI,"This research is supported by the Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB) and Electricite de France (EDF) in the context of the CESAB project 'Causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales' (FREE).

To date, the effects of habitat conditions on plant biomass allocation have been widely studied. However, it is less known how plant community traits and functions (PCTF) affect biomass allocation, particularly in alpine grassland ecosystems. In this study, community-weighted means (CWM) were calculated at the community level using five leaf functional traits, and the relationships between PCTF and biomass trade-offs were explored using correlation analysis, variation partitioning analysis and structural equation modeling. We found that the trade-off values were greater than zero in both alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS) across the Tibetan Plateau, with different values of 0.203 and 0.088 for AM and AS, respectively. Moreover, the critical factors determining biomass allocation in AS were species richness (SR; scored at 0.69) and leaf dry matter content of CWM (CWMLDMC, scored at 0.42), while in AM, the key factors were leaf dry matter content (CWMLDMC, scored at 0.48) and leaf carbon content of CWM (CWMLC, scored at -0.45). In particular, both CWMLDMC and SR in AS, as well as CWMLDMC and CWMLC in AM were primarily regulated by precipitation. In summary, precipitation tends to drive biomass allocation in alpine grasslands through its effects on PCTF, hence highlighting the importance of PCTF in regulating plant biomass allocation strategies along precipitation gradients.","[Sun, Le; Sun, Jian; Li, Wen-Cheng; Liang, Er-Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm & Reso, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jian; Wu, Jun-Xi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Du, Zi-Yin] China West Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanchong 637002, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-Jun] Southwest Minzu Univ, Inst Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, State Key Lab Biol Control, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Liu, Miao] China Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; China West Normal University; Southwest Minzu University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; China Agricultural University","Sun, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm & Reso, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Sun, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",sunjian@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,NA,100,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

A modified physical appearance of ecosystems may affect the short- and long-term provision of ecosystem goods and services (EG&S) from forests. Ecosystem functioning research provides powerful tools for both, the mechanistic description of ecosystem dynamics and the normative assessment of the value of ecosystems. Holistic insights into the functioning of ecosystems require interdisciplinary projects. However, disciplinary differences in terminology and implicit underlying assumptions about relationships between descriptive ecosystem characteristics and their relevance for society may lead to misunderstandings hindering conceptual integration of disciplines. This highlights the need for a common language in ecosystem functioning research. Here, we provide a classification scheme of different types of ecosystem characteristics applicable across disciplines. We introduce a terminology that unambiguously differentiates between normative and descriptive uses of the terms 'ecosystem function', 'ecosystem functioning' and 'ecosystem goods and services'. Based on this terminology, we propose a framework facilitating the explicit communication of hypotheses, underlying assumptions, analyses and conclusions belonging to three different aspects of ecosystem functioning: (1) mechanistic ecosystem functioning, (2) supplying ecosystem functioning and (3) ecosystem integrity. 'Mechanistic ecosystem functioning' addresses relationships and interactions between purely descriptive ecosystem characteristics and their dependence on external factors. 'Supplying ecosystem functioning' translates descriptive ecosystem characteristics into benefits for society in providing EG&S. 'Ecosystem integrity' assesses the capabilities of ecosystems to provide EG&S in the long term. We further propose the use of a mathematical interpretation of the term 'ecosystem function' as 'characteristic A is the function of characteristics B, C, . . . , X'. This definition clearly accounts for complex relationships between ecosystem characteristics and avoids ambiguity inherent in the discrimination of 'ecosystem-functions' and other ('non-functional') ecosystem characteristics. Our approach will increase understanding across disciplines and foster joint syntheses by providing a unified framework for interdisciplinary studies. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

The primary strategies (competitive ability, adaptation to severe stress and adaptation to disturbance) relate to the productivity and level of disturbance at a given site. Accordingly, their change in space and time may serve as an illustration and measure of key processes such as succession, eutrophication and habitat shift. Here, we make use of the known links between the three primary strategies to traits with potential relevance for canopy reflectance, and test whether remote sensing is able to reproduce the spatial pattern of strategy types. Location: A raised bog and minerotrophic fen complex, Murnauer Moos, Germany. Methods: Field data on the distribution of plant strategies in sample plots were regressed against canopy reflectance using partial least squares regression. The resulting models were validated and applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery on a per pixel basis. The resulting local maps for each strategy type and their combined representation in an RGB colour composite were interpreted in terms of plant species composition and environmental constraints. Results: All three primary strategy types could be mapped using remote sensing. Reflectance spectra related to competitive ability and adaptation to severe stress suggest that typical traits linked to these strategies exerted a direct influence. On the other hand, species with low cover values played a decisive role for the strength of the statistical relationship between reflectance and strategies. Because these species have a low impact on canopy reflectance, their contribution is better explained by their role as proxies for covarying variables such as the total cover of dead plantmaterial. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the potential to detect community strategy type composition using hyperspectral remote sensing, providing direct insights into spatial ecological patterns. By illustrating the exposure to stress, competition and disturbance, the derived maps of functional traits are potentially useful for applications in nature management and for the monitoring of functional shifts in ecosystems. As a next step, they can be easily combined into maps of functional diversity. Upcoming satellites with higher spectral resolution will improve access to this kind of spatial information.","[Schmidtlein, Sebastian; Feilhauer, Hannes] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Schmidtlein, Sebastian; Feilhauer, Hannes] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol, D-06108 Halle, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Bonn; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Schmidtlein, S (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",s.schmidtlein@uni-bonn.de; hannes@giub.uni-bonn.de; helge.bruelheide@botanik.uni-halle.de,"Schmidtlein, Sebastian/Q-2919-2016; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Feilhauer, Hannes/0000-0001-5758-6303; Schmidtlein, Sebastian/0000-0003-1888-1865",German Science Foundation (DFG); University of Bayreuth; German Aerospace Centre and cooperation of the local conservancy authorities,German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Bayreuth; German Aerospace Centre and cooperation of the local conservancy authorities,"This project was funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG project 'Remote sensing of vegetation boundaries') and the University of Bayreuth.

Their community structure is known to be affected by soil conditions such as organic matter and pH. However, the effect of plant species, whose roots provide the litter input into the soil, on the saprophytic fungal community is largely unknown. Methods We examined the saprophytic fungi in a grassland biodiversity experiment with eight plant species belonging to two functional groups (grasses and forbs), combining DNA extraction from plant roots, next-generation sequencing and literature research. Results We found that saprophyte richness increased with plant species richness, but plant functional group richness was the best predictor. Plant functional group was also the main factor driving fungal saprophytic community structure. This effect was correlated with differences in root lignin content and C:N ratio between grasses and forbs. In monocultures, root traits and plant functional group type explained 16% of the variation in community structure. The saprophyte taxa detected in mixed plant communities were to a large extent subsets of those found in monocultures. Conclusions Our work shows that the richness and community structure of the root-associated saprophytic fungi can largely be predicted by plant functional groups and their associated root traits. This means that the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functions such as litter decomposition may also be predictable using information on plant functional groups in grasslands.","[Francioli, Davide; van Ruijven, Jasper; Mommer, Liesje] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Rijssel, Sophie Q.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, POB 50, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Termorshuizen, Aad J.] Aad Termorshuizen Consultancy, Kabeljauwallee 11, NL-6865 BL Doorwerth, Netherlands; [Cotton, T.

Multispecies reforestation plantings present a valuable opportunity to investigate BEF relationships in woody systems, especially across large environmental gradients. Location Reforestation plantings across the arable region of Australia. Time period 1951-2012. Major taxa studied Three hundred and sixty-four woody plant species. Methods We examined relationships between productivity and diversity using inventory data from 977 plots in 386 multispecies reforestation plantings. Diversity was estimated using observed species richness and three functional diversity indices calculated from four functional traits: specific leaf area, wood density, seed mass and maximum attainable height. We modelled how plot-level biomass accumulation (a productivity proxy) correlated with these diversity indices, as well as age since planting, plant density and three environmental variables: solar radiation, moisture availability and soil sand content. These models were fitted across Australia and, separately, within eight groups of plantings with similar environmental conditions. Results We found no correlation between diversity and productivity, regardless of the diversity metric or spatial scale used (continent-wide or within environment groups). Instead, productivity was best explained by local environmental conditions and plant density. Main conclusions A positive relationship between diversity and productivity was not evident in planted forests across a wide range of Australian woodland and forest systems, at least in the first few decades of growth. Our findings suggest that the positive relationship between diversity and productivity commonly reported in experimental settings should not be assumed for all systems and conditions.","[Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.; Mayfield, Margaret M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Staples, Timothy L.; Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO Land & Water, EcoSci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [England, Jacqueline R.] CSIRO Land & Water, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Staples, TL (autor correspondente), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Bldg 60, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",timothy.staples@uqconnect.edu.au,"Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; Staples, Tim/AEI-0009-2022; England, Jacqueline R/G-6417-2011; Mayfield, Margaret M/B-7386-2012","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; England, Jacqueline R/0000-0002-3371-1509; Mayfield, Margaret M/0000-0002-5101-6542; Staples, Timothy/0000-0002-8550-2661",Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; University of Queensland,"Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; University of Queensland(University of Queensland)","This work was funded by a University of Queensland and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Integrated Natural Resource Management PhD Grant, and T.L.S. was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

We assessed the relative importance of species richness, phylogenetic diversity, functional diversity, and identity of neighbors for stem growth 3 yr after seedling establishment in a tree diversity experiment in eastern Minnesota. Generally, we found that community-weighted means of key functional traits (including mycorrhizal association, leaf nitrogen and calcium, and waterlogging tolerance) as well as species richness were strong, independent predictors of stem biomass growth. More phylogenetically diverse communities did not consistently produce more biomass than expected, and the trait values or diversity of individual functional traits better predicted biomass production than did a multidimensional functional diversity metric. Furthermore, functional traits and species richness best predicted growth at the whole-plot level (12 m(2)), whereas neighborhood composition best predicted growth at the focal tree level (0.25 m(2)). The observed effects of biodiversity on growth appear strongly driven by positive complementary effects rather than by species-specific selection effects, suggesting that synergistic species' interactions rather than the influence of a few important species may drive overyielding.","[Grossman, Jake J.; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.; Montgomery, Rebecca A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, 115 Green Hall,1530 Cleveland Ave N, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW, Australia",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University,"Grossman, JJ (autor correspondente), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",gross679@umn.edu,"Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/K-5716-2013","Grossman, Jake/0000-0001-6468-8551; Cavender-Bares, Jeannine/0000-0003-3375-9630","Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program [DEB-1234162]; Crosby Fund at the University of Minnesota; Rothman Fund at the University of Minnesota; Wilkie Fund at the University of Minnesota; Anderson Fund at the University of Minnesota; Dayton Fund at the University of Minnesota; department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1234162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program; Crosby Fund at the University of Minnesota; Rothman Fund at the University of Minnesota; Wilkie Fund at the University of Minnesota; Anderson Fund at the University of Minnesota; Dayton Fund at the University of Minnesota; department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","Research was supported by the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research program (DEB-1234162).

Species and trait differences that contribute to ecosystem services are the product of past evolutionary change and phylogenetic diversity (PD), which quantifies the relatedness among species within a community. In this study, we present an experimental framework to assess the contribution of plant community PD for green roof ecosystem service delivery, and data from one season that support our hypotheses that PD would be positively correlated with two services: building cooling and rainwater management. Using 28 plant species in 12 families, we created six community combinations with different levels of PD. Each of these communities was replicated at eight green roofs along an elevation gradient, as well as a ground level control. We found that the minimum and mean roof temperature decreased with increasing PD in the plant community. Increasing PD also led to an increase in the volume of rainwater captured, but not the proportion of water lost via evapotranspiration 48 hr following the rain event. Our findings suggest that considering these evolutionary relationships could improve functioning of green infrastructure and we recommend that understanding how to make PD (and other measures of diversity) serviceable for plant selection by practitioners will improve the effectiveness of design and ecosystem service delivery. Lastly, since no two green roof sites are the same and can vary tremendously in microclimate conditions, our study illustrates the importance of including multiple independent sites in studies of green roof performance.","[MacIvor, J.

Here, we propose a novel trait-based productivity (TBP) framework, as a core of plant community traits in land areas, to interpret the variation in productivity. We assumed that productivity in TBP is determined by a threedimensional combination of efficiency x quantity x growth length and tested it using data regarding leaf chlorophyll traits (scaling-up community weighted mean) in three grassland transects of the Tibetan, Mongolian, and Loess Plateaus in China. The results showed that 52%, 54%, and 67% of the variations in gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, and aboveground net primary productivity, respectively, were captured by the TBP framework in all grassland transects, indicating that it was applicable for the three environmentally distinct plateaus. Furthermore, it was more fitted to the environmentally stressful Tibetan plateau, with an explanatory power of up to 83%. Compared with chlorophyll efficiency, the chlorophyll quantity which is regulated by climate or regional limiting factors, has dominant roles in influencing the spatial variation of grassland productivity. The TBP framework emphasises the connotation of traits behind community functions and seemed as a potential in ecological estimations and predictions; however, multiple traits should be considered for further improvement in the future.

Recently, trait- and phylogenetic-based tests provide a powerful way to detect the relationship in different spaces but have seldom been applied to stressful zones on a large spatial scale. We selected Qinghai-Tibetan as the study area and collected a grassland community database involving 581 communities. We calculated biomass and species', functional, and phylogenetic diversity of each community and examined their relationships by using linear and non-linear regression models. Results showed an overall positive biodiversity-productivity relationship in species', functional and phylogenetic space. The relationship, however, was non-linear, in which biodiversity explained better the variation in community biomass when species diversity was more than a threshold, showing a weak effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function in low species diversity communities. We also found a filled triangle for the limit of the relationship between species and functional diversity, implying that functional diversity differs significantly among communities when their species diversity is low but finally converges to be a constant with increasing communities' species diversity. Our study suggests that multiple niche processes may structure the grassland communities, and their forces tend to balance in high-biodiversity communities.","[Qi, Wei; Kang, Xiaomei; Du, Guozhen] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Knops, Johannes M.

Individual plant genotypes as well as genotypic diversity can shape the structure and function of ecosystems; however, the abiotic environment may modify these genotypic influences on ecosystem-level responses. 2. To explore how the interactions between plant genotype, genotypic diversity and soil nutrient availability affect the structure and function of a temperate grassland ecosystem, we manipulated the genotypic diversity of a common perennial herbaceous plant, Solidago altissima (single genotype monoculture and diversity plots) and soil nutrient availability (+nitrogen, +phosphorus, +nitrogen and +phosphorus, unmanipulated control) in a common garden setting. We tracked temporal changes in ecosystem structure (e.g. leaf area index and net primary productivity) as well as a variety of ecosystem functions (e.g. net ecosystem carbon and water exchange and soil carbon efflux) over a growing season. 3. We found that variation in plant genotype identity consistently shaped ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) while it inconsistently altered several ecosystem functions across time. For instance, variation in plant genotype identity influenced net ecosystem carbon dynamics early in the growing season while it influenced water dynamics later in the growing season. The strength of the relationship between genotypic diversity and ecosystem function declined over the season and the relationship between ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) and function (net ecosystem carbon and water exchange) varied across treatments. Overall, there was a strong correlation between ecosystem structure and function across monoculture genotype plots but a weak relationship between ecosystem structure and function across mixed genotype plots. Surprisingly, soil nutrients did not influence ecosystem structure and had minimal impacts on carbon and water flux. 4. Our data suggest that plant genetic variation, and to some extent plant genotypic diversity, strongly influence ecosystem structure and function in an old-field ecosystem, but nutrient availability did not directly or interactively influence ecosystem structure or function.","[Souza, Lara; Stuble, Katharine L.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, 111 E Chesapeake St, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Souza, Lara; Stuble, Katharine L.] Univ Oklahoma, Microbiol & Plant Biol Dept, 111 E Chesapeake St, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Souza, Lara; Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Stuble, Katharine L.] Holden Arboretum, Kirtland, OH 44094 USA; [Genung, Mark A.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, 14 Coll Farm Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Classen, Aimee T.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Souza, L (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, 111 E Chesapeake St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Souza, L (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Microbiol & Plant Biol Dept, 111 E Chesapeake St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Souza, L (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",lara.souza@ou.edu,"Classen, Aimee T/C-4035-2008; Classen, Aimee T/AAM-5671-2021; Genung, Mark A/K-5897-2012; Classen, Aimee/X-2984-2019","Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; Classen, Aimee T/0000-0002-6741-3470; ","Junior Directed Research and Development (JDRD) grant through Science Alliance Program at the University of Tennessee; American Association of University Women (AAUW); American Fellowship Award; Danish National Research Foundation Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate [DNRF96]","Junior Directed Research and Development (JDRD) grant through Science Alliance Program at the University of Tennessee; American Association of University Women (AAUW); American Fellowship Award; Danish National Research Foundation Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate","We would like to thank L.

The ecological interaction network among plant traits could reflect how ecosystem interact with, influence, and respond to environment change. In this study, the interaction network between leaf, root, and biomass function was revealed to indicate systemic ecosystem response to increasing aridity and grazing by sampling in enclosed plots along the aridity gradient and in neighboring grazing plots of China drylands. Systemic and abrupt changes in the network relationship between leaf, root, and biomass were observed with a threshold value of 1-AI (aridity index) -0.8. The control effect of roots on other traits and the interaction of leaf and root compartments increased in the opposite direction above the threshold. The change in the relative importance of key traits with increasing aridity caused the different grazing effects. Grazing decreased the leaf area in the area with1-AI -0.6, whereas it increased the effect of roots in the area with 1-AI -0.8, thus promoting the interaction of functional traits. This result suggests the essential role of the interaction network between plant traits in ecosystem response to environmental change, which could indicate the ecosystem change in a holistic perspective under global change.","[Gao, Dexin; Li, Changjia; Wu, Xutong; Liu, Yanxu; Ye, Chongchong; Fu, Bojie; Wang, Shuai] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wei, Fangli; Fu, Bojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Li, CJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",changjia.li@bnu.edu.cn,"Shi, Z/ISB-4324-2023; Wu, Xutong/GLN-5137-2022; wang, shuai/B-2334-2017","Wu, Xutong/0000-0001-6124-0436; wang, shuai/0000-0003-1595-9858",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19030201]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA19030201) , and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Despite ongoing plant diversity loss due to anthropogenic activities, our understanding of the effects of plant diversity on fine root traits remains elusive. We addressed: (a) Do fine roots modify their traits in response to species mixtures? (b) Do these responses change with the species richness in mixtures, stand age, and soil depth? (c) Do plant-mixture induced responses of root traits differ across terrestrial ecosystems? Location Global. Time period Publication years: 1985-2019. Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We conducted a global meta-analysis of 852 paired observations from 103 published studies to assess the effects of species mixtures on fine root biomass and traits (including root/shoot ratio, community-weighted mean rooting depth, root length density, specific root length, mean root diameter and root nitrogen content). Results We found that the effects of species mixtures were highly dependent on species richness in mixtures, stand age, and soil depth. The positive effects of species mixtures on root biomass increased with species richness, soil depth, and mean annual temperature. Species mixture effects on root length density shifted from negative to positive with increasing stand age and soil depth and with decreased temperatures. The effects of species mixtures on specific root length shifted from positive to negative with increasing species richness and soil depth, and from negative to positive with increasing stand age. Main conclusions Our meta-analysis highlights that the community-level consequences of changes in plant diversity on fine root traits are not consistent, and that predicting these consequences requires taking into account the extent of changes in plant species richness, stand age, soil depth investigated, background climates, and importantly, particular fine root traits.","[Peng, Sai; Chen, Han Y.

The identification of functional effect traits that predict species ability for erosion control would be of great interest for ecological restoration purposes. Flume experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of the root systems of three species having contrasted ecological requirements from eroded marly lands of the French Southern Alps [i.e. Robinia pseudo acacia (tree), Pinus nigra austriaca (tree) and Achnatherum calamagrostis (grass)], on concentrated flow erosion rates. Ten functional traits, describing plant morphological and biomechanical features, were measured on each tested sample. Analyses were performed to identify traits that determine plant root effects on erosion control. Erosion rates were lowest for samples of Robinia pseudo acacia, intermediate in Achnatherum calamagrostis and highest in Pinus nigra austriaca. The three species also differed strongly in their traits. Principal components analysis showed that the erosion-reducing potential of plant species was negatively correlated to root diameter and positively correlated to the percentage of fine roots. The results highlighted the role of small flexible roots in root reinforcement processes, and suggested the importance of high root surface and higher tensile strength for soil stabilization. By combining flume experiment to plant functional traits measurements, we identified root system features influencing plant species performance for soil protection against concentrated flow erosion. Plant functional traits related to species efficiency for erosion control represent useful tools to improve the diagnosis of land vulnerability to erosion, plant community resistance and the prediction of ecosystem functioning after ecological restoration.

Although responses to drought of individual functional traits are relatively well-known, simultaneous changes across multiple traits in response to water scarcity remain poorly understood despite its importance to understand alternative strategies to resist drought. We grew 52 herbaceous species in monocultures under drought and control treatments and characterized the functional space using seven measured above- and below-ground traits: plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, specific root length, average root diameter, and root dry matter content. Then, we estimated how each species occupied this space and the amount of functional space occupied in both treatments using trait probability density functions. We also estimated intraspecific trait variability (ITV) for each species as the dissimilarity in trait values between the individuals of each treatment. We then mapped drought resistance and ITV in the functional space using generalized additive models. The response of species to drought strongly depended on their traits, with species that invested more in root tissues and conserved small size being both more resistant to drought and having higher ITV. We also observed a significant trend of trait displacement towards less conservative strategies. However, these changes depended strongly on the trait values of species in the control treatment, with species with different traits having opposing responses to drought. These contrasting responses resulted in lower trait variability in the species pool in drought compared to control conditions. Our results suggest strong trait filtering acting on conservative species as well as the existence of an optimal part in the functional space to which species converge under drought. Our results show that changes in species trait-space occupancy are key to understand plant strategies to withstand drought, highlighting the importance of individual variation in response to environmental changes, and suggest that community-wide functional diversity and biomass productivity could decrease in a drier future. Knowing these shifts will help to anticipate changes in ecosystem functioning facing climate change.

Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) was the trait that performed best. Mass loss in single species bags was best predicted using an exponential model. LDMC explained 48% of the variance in mixture mass loss. There was no significant impact of mixture species richness on mass loss.

How ecosystem functioning depends on these measures of diversity can vary from site to site and depends on successional stage. Here, we measured taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and examined their relationship with biomass in two successional stages of the broad-leaved Korean pine forest in northeastern China. Functional diversity was calculated from six plant traits, and aboveground biomass (AGB) and coarse woody productivity (CWP) were estimated using data from three forest censuses (10 years) in two large fully mapped forest plots (25 and 5 ha). 11 of the 12 regressions between biomass variables (AGB and CWP) and indices of diversity showed significant positive relationships, especially those with phylogenetic diversity. The mean tree diversity-biomass regressions increased from 0.11 in secondary forest to 0.31 in old-growth forest, implying a stronger biodiversity effect in more mature forest. Multi-model selection results showed that models including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and single functional traits explained more variation in forest biomass than other candidate models. The models with a single functional trait, i.e., leaf area in secondary forest and wood density in mature forest, provided better explanations for forest biomass than models that combined all six functional traits. This finding may reflect different strategies in growth and resource acquisition in secondary and old-growth forests.","[Yuan, Zuoqiang; Lin, Fei; Ye, Ji; Hao, Zhanqing; Wang, Xugao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, KeyLab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shaopeng] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Wang, Shaopeng] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Gazol, Antonio] CSIC, IPE, Ave Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50010, Spain; [Mellard, Jarad] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Loreau, Michel] Paul Sabatier Univ, F-09200 Moulis, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE); UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier","Wang, XG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, KeyLab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110164, Peoples R China.",wangxg@iae.ac.cn,"Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Wang, Xugao/B-1111-2015; Gazol, Antonio/B-7322-2015","Wang, Xugao/0000-0003-1207-8852; Gazol, Antonio/0000-0001-5902-9543; Wang, Shaopeng/0000-0002-9430-8879; Mellard, Jarad/0000-0003-1824-919X","external cooperation program of BIC, Chinese Academy of Sciences [151221KYSB20130003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301057, 31370444]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (Contrato Formacion Postdoctoral MINECO-FPDI) [2013-16600]; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (FEDER); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation [FZT 118]; CFERN GENE; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1545761] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1354741] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","external cooperation program of BIC, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (Contrato Formacion Postdoctoral MINECO-FPDI); Postdoctoral grant from MINECO (FEDER); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig - German Research Foundation; CFERN GENE; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

Evidence shows that FD strongly determines ecosystem functioning and stability and also regulates various ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. Given the importance of FD, it is critical to monitor its variations in an explicit manner across space and time, a highly demanding task that cannot be resolved solely by field data. Today, high hopes are placed on satellite-based observations to complement field plot data. The promise is that multiscale monitoring of plant FD, ecosystem functioning, and their services is now possible at global scales in near real-time. However, non-trivial scale challenges remain to be overcome before plant ecology can capitalize on the latest advances in Earth Observation (EO). Here, we articulate the existing scale challenges in linking field and satellite data and further elaborated in detail how to address these challenges via the latest innovations in optical and radar sensor technologies and image analysis algorithms. Addressing these challenges not only requires novel remote sensing theories and algorithms but also urges more effective communication between remote sensing scientists and field ecologists to foster mutual understanding of the existing challenges. Only through a collaborative approach can we achieve the global plant functional diversity monitoring goal.","[Ma, Xuanlong; Wirth, Christian; Richter, Ronny; Mahecha, Miguel D.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Ma, Xuanlong; Migliavacca, Mirco; Wirth, Christian; Mahecha, Miguel D.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Wirth, Christian; Richter, Ronny] Univ Leipzig, Dept Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Bohn, Friedrich J.; Huth, Andreas] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modeling, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Richter, Ronny; Mahecha, Miguel D.] Univ Leipzig, Inst Geog, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Max Planck Society; Leipzig University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University,"Ma, XL (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.;Ma, XL (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",xma.lzu@icloud.com; mmiglia@bgc-jena.mpg.de; cwirth@uni-leipzig.de; friedrich.bohn@ufz.de; andreas.huth@ufz.de; ronny.richter@idiv.de; mmahecha@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Ma, Xuanlong/AAH-6206-2021; Migliavacca, Mirco/J-9986-2019; Mahecha, Miguel/F-2443-2010; Wirth, Christian/A-4446-2016; Ma, Xuanlong/E-7366-2014","Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; Mahecha, Miguel/0000-0003-3031-613X; Ma, Xuanlong/0000-0003-1499-8476; Richter, Ronny/0000-0002-8728-7918",iDiv-Flexpool project oBEF-Across; European Union H2020 project BACI [640176],iDiv-Flexpool project oBEF-Across; European Union H2020 project BACI,This work was supported by an iDiv-Flexpool project oBEF-Across and a European Union H2020 project BACI (grant number: 640176).,NA,66,14,15,7,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,APR,2020,12,8,,NA,,NA,,,1248,10.3390/rs12081248,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12081248,NA,,13,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,LP9II,NA,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000534628800021,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, Earth System Models (ESMs), our most powerful tools for predicting the effects of humans on the coupled biosphere-atmosphere system, simplify the incredible diversity of land plants into a handful of coarse categories of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) that often fail to capture ecological dynamics such as biome distributions. The inclusion of more realistic functional diversity is a recognized goal for ESMs, yet there is currently no consistent, widely accepted way to add diversity to models, that is, to determine what new PFTs to add and with what data to constrain their parameters. We review approaches to representing plant diversity in ESMs and draw on recent ecological and evolutionary findings to present an evolution-based functional type approach for further disaggregating functional diversity. Specifically, the prevalence of niche conservatism, or the tendency of closely related taxa to retain similar ecological and functional attributes through evolutionary time, reveals that evolutionary relatedness is a powerful framework for summarizing functional similarities and differences among plant types. We advocate that Plant Functional Types based on dominant evolutionary lineages (Lineage Functional Types) will provide an ecologically defensible, tractable, and scalable framework for representing plant diversity in next-generation ESMs, with the potential to improve parameterization, process representation, and model benchmarking. We highlight how the importance of evolutionary history for plant function can unify the work of disparate fields to improve predictive modeling of the Earth system.","[Anderegg, Leander D.

Ecosystem processes are driven by both environmental variables and the attributes of component species. The extent to which these effects are independent and/or dependent upon each other has remained unclear. We assess the extent to which climate affects net primary productivity (NPP) both directly and indirectly via its effect on plant size and leaf functional traits. 2. Using species occurrences and functional trait databases for North and South America, we describe the upper limit of woody plant height within 200 x 200 km grid-cells. In addition to maximum tree height, we quantify grid-cell means of three leaf traits (specific leaf area, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration) also hypothesized to influence productivity. Using structural equation modelling, we test the direct and indirect effects of environment and plant traits on remotely sensed MODIS-derived estimates of NPP, using plant size (satellite-measured canopy height and potential maximum tree height), leaf traits, growing season length, soil nutrients, climate and disturbances as explanatory variables. 3. Our results show that climate affects NPP directly as well as indirectly via plant size in both tropical and temperate forests. In tropical forests NPP further increases with leaf phosphorus concentration, whereas in temperate forests it increases with leaf nitrogen concentration. In boreal forests, NPP most strongly increases with increasing temperature and neither plant size nor leaf traits have a significant influence. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that at large spatial scales plant size and leaf nutrient traits can improve predictions of forest productivity over those based on climate alone. However, at higher latitudes their role is overridden by stressful climate. Our results provide independent empirical evidence for where and how global vegetation models predicting carbon fluxes could benefit from including effects of plant size and leaf stoichiometry.","[Simova, Irena] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simova, Irena] Czech Acad Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Simova, Irena] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Ecol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sandel, Brody] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Biol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.; Michaletz, Sean T.; Boyle, Brad] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Michaletz, Sean T.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Michaletz, Sean T.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut UMR 5175, Montpellier, France; [McGill, Brian J.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol Sustainabil Solut Initiat, Orono, ME USA; [Blonder, Benjamin] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Blonder, Benjamin] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Engemann, Kristine; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Engemann, Kristine; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Peet, Robert K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Wiser, Susan K.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Morueta-Holme, Naia] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Boyle, Brad] Hardner & Gullison Associates LLC, Amherst, NH USA; [Kraft, Nathan J.

Here, we analyzed the relationships among community weighted means of functional traits, functional diversity, and leaf and soil chemical properties of plant communities during various stages of vegetation restoration in Mao Lan National Karst Forest Nature Reserve, located in humid subtropical Guizhou of China. Our results showed significant changes in four weighted functional traits of plant communities at different restoration stages, namely, plant height, leaf width to leaf length ratio, and leaf area. Additionally, with the progression of the recovery of plant communities, functional richness, functional separation, and quadratic entropy, the coefficient tended to increase. Functional divergence tended to gradually decrease. The association of functional diversity with soil chemical properties was stronger than that with leaf ecological stoichiometry. Regarding leaf and soil chemical properties, soil phosphorus content and leaf C:P were particularly important in influencing functional diversity. Our overall findings indicate that functional traits shift from acquisitive to conservative as the community is restored. Karst plant communities reduce interspecific resource competition as restoration proceeds, thereby increasing functional overlap effects.","[Wang, Yang; Zhang, Limin; Chen, Jin; Feng, Ling; Li, Fangbing; Yu, Lifei] Guizhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Plant Resource Conservat & Germplasm Inno, Inst Agrobioengn, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Limin] Guizhou Acad Sci, Inst Mt Resources, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China",Guizhou University,"Yu, LF (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Plant Resource Conservat & Germplasm Inno, Inst Agrobioengn, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.",wangyang20218910@126.com; zhanglimin563406@163.com; gs.chenjin20@gzu.edu.cn; 15870149772@163.com; lifangbing9685@163.com; lfyu@gzu.edu.cn,"CHEN, Jin/ABF-4071-2022","Zhang, Limin/0000-0002-7624-0735; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-1684-1192; yang, Wang/0000-0001-9597-7655",Project of National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502604]; Major Project of Guizhou Province [[2016]3022]; Construction Program of Biology First-class Discipline in Guizhou [GNYL [2017]009]; Project of Promoted Innovation for Colleges and Universities of Guizhou Province [[2014]01],Project of National Key Research and Development Program of China; Major Project of Guizhou Province; Construction Program of Biology First-class Discipline in Guizhou; Project of Promoted Innovation for Colleges and Universities of Guizhou Province,"This research was funded by the Project of National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502604), the Major Project of Guizhou Province (Qian Ke He Major Project [2016]3022), and the Construction Program of Biology First-class Discipline in Guizhou (GNYL [2017]009), and the Project of Promoted Innovation for Colleges and Universities of Guizhou Province (Qian Jiao He Collaborative Innovation [2014]01).",NA,67,2,3,27,82,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUN,2022,13,6,,NA,,NA,,,864,10.3390/f13060864,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13060864,NA,,17,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,2J8KG,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000815898200001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These responses may be predicted by two independent classes of drivers: plant size-larger plants respire more and produce a larger quantity of labile C, and plant economics-plants possessing more acquisitive plant economics strategies (i.e. high metabolic rate and tissue nutrient content) produce higher-quality tissue that respires rapidly and decomposes quickly. At two sites in central Texas, USA with similar climates and differing soil characteristics, we examined the response of eight Panicum virgatum genotypes to three annual precipitation levels defined by the driest, average and wettest years from each site's precipitation history. We evaluated the individual and joint influence of plant genotypes and precipitation on JCO2 and traits related to plant economics and plant size. We then used confirmatory path analysis to evaluate whether effects of precipitation on JCO2 were in part related to effects of precipitation on plant economics traits or size ('mediated' effects). These genotypes exhibited variation in plant economics traits and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), an above-ground measure of plant size. Increasing precipitation increased JCO2 and ANPP more than plant economics traits. At both sites, ANPP was the best predictor of JCO2 . Moreover, the sites differed in the ways that plant size and plant economics traits combined with precipitation to influence JCO2 . At the Austin site, the positive effect of precipitation on JCO2 was mediated primarily by ANPP, offset by a smaller effect of leaf nitrogen content; no direct precipitation effect was detected. At the Temple site, increasing precipitation had positive direct and ANPP-mediated effects on JCO2 . This suggests that greater water limitation at Austin may strengthen the links between plant size and JCO2 . Synthesis. Estimates of C cycling can be improved by accounting for mediation of precipitation effects on JCO2 by plant economics traits and plant size in resource-limited environments.","[Heckman, Robert W.; Khasanova, Albina R.; Johnson, Nicholas S.; Weber, Soren; Bonnette, Jason E.; Aspinwall, Michael J.; Reichmann, Lara G.; Juenger, Thomas E.; Hawkes, Christine, V] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Fay, Philip A.] USDA ARS, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Johnson, Nicholas S.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Weber, Soren] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Aspinwall, Michael J.] Univ North Florida, Dept Biol, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Reichmann, Lara G.] Univ San Francisco, Data Inst, San Francisco, CA USA; [Hawkes, Christine, V] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; University of Zurich; State University System of Florida; University of North Florida; University of San Francisco; North Carolina State University,"Heckman, RW (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",robert.heckman@utexas.edu,"Fay, Philip A./I-1853-2012; Aspinwall, Michael/ABH-9774-2020; Heckman, Robert/J-2640-2015","Fay, Philip A./0000-0002-8291-6316; Aspinwall, Michael/0000-0003-0199-2972; Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469; Heckman, Robert/0000-0002-2281-3091","USDA-NIFA [2010-65615-20632]; NSF PGRP [IOS-0922457, IOS-1444533]; NIFA [2010-65615-20632, 581003] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); NSF PGRP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"USDA-NIFA, Grant/Award Number: 2010-65615-20632; NSF PGRP, Grant/Award Number: IOS-0922457 and IOS-1444533",NA,62,7,7,4,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

By linking species delineations, morphological traits and measured or inferred functional roles, we demonstrate a method for functional identification of soil faunal assemblages based on molecular information. Here we align the genetic inter-relatedness and functional trait expression in nematodes and springtails. Nematodes were assigned feeding guild, plant parasitic feeding type and coloniser-persister (c-p) value, with springtail sequences assigned to soil vertical stratification level, soil moisture preference and a selection of morphological traits. We found that both nematode and springtail feeding preferences show significant phylogenetic clustering. In contrast, greater dispersal was found amongst nematode coloniser-persister (c-p) values and springtail soil vertical stratification level and moisture preferences. Minimum patristic (p) distances between species supported the clustering amongst nematode feeding guilds, with plant feeders being separated from all other guilds by at least p = 0.99. Distances between endoparasitic, ectoparasitic and sedentary plant parasitic nematodes were also distinct with minimal distances of p = 0.35-0.72 between parasitic types. Springtail stratification level and soil moisture preferences showed greater dispersion across phylogenies, with negligible between-group minimum patristic distances. However, nematode c-p values and springtail moisture preference alignments indicate some genetic conservation at the genus level. These results indicate how ecosystems can direct trait conservation beyond that of environmental stimuli. Being able to assign functional traits to novel sequences will allow individual species' likely contribution to ecosystem functioning to be inferred without the need for exact taxonomic identification. More broadly, such information can advance our understanding of the evolution of soil faunal traits and the contribution of diverse soil assemblages to functional soil systems, particularly those with a high proportion of undescribed species.","[Ross, Giles M.; Nielsen, Uffe N.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Berg, Matty P.] Vrije Univ, Dept Ecol Sci, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Berg, Matty P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Community & Conservat Ecol Grp, Nijenborgh 7, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Salmon, Sandrine] Museum Natl Hist Nat, MECADEV, UMR 7179, Dept Living Adaptat, 1 Ave Petit Chateau, F-91800 Paris, France",Western Sydney University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Groningen; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN),"Ross, GM (corresponding author), Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",giles.ross@westernsydney.edu.au,"Ross, Giles/GSM-9269-2022","Ross, Giles Michael/0000-0001-8694-9484",,,,NA,104,1,1,9,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,MAY,2022,47,3,,NA,,NA,465,481,,10.1111/aec.13153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13153,NA,FEB 2022,17,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0N1HB,NA,Green Published,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000759996800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a novel trait -based approach, the CArbon and Ecosystem functional-Trait Evaluation (CAETE<SIC>) model to investigate the role of plant trait diversity in representing vegetation carbon (C) storage and net primary productivity (NPP) in current climatic conditions. We assess impacts of plant functional diversity on vegetation C storage under low precipitation in the Amazon basin, by employing two approaches (low and high plant trait diversity, respec-tively): (i) a plant functional type (PFT) approach comprising three PFTs, and (ii) a trait-based approach rep-resenting 3000 plant life strategies (PLSs). The PFTs/PLSs are defined by combinations of six traits: C allocation and residence time in leaves, wood, and fine roots. We found that including trait variability improved the model's performance in representing NPP and vegetation C storage in the Amazon. When considering the whole basin, simulated reductions in precipitation caused vegetation C storage loss by similar to 60% for both model ap-proaches, while the PFT approach simulated a more widespread C loss and abrupt changes in neighboring grid cells. We found that owing to high trait variability in the trait-based approach, the plant community was able to functionally reorganize itself via changes in the relative abundance of different plant life strategies, which therefore resulted in the emergence of previously rare trait combinations in the model simulation. The trait-based approach yielded strategies that invest more heavily in fine roots to deal with limited water availability, which allowed the occupation of grid cells where none of the PFTs were able to establish. The prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in other studies. However, the higher investment in roots also had consequences: it resulted, for the trait-based approach, in a higher root: shoot ratio (a mean increase of 74.74%) leading to a lower vegetation C storage in some grid cells. Our findings highlight that accounting for plant functional diversity is crucial when evaluating the sensitivity of the Amazon forest to climate change, and therefore allow for a more mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity for tropical forest ecosystem functioning.","[Rius, Bianca Fazio; Filho, Joao Paulo Darela; Blanco, Carolina Casagrande; Lapola, David Montenegro] Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, Earth Syst Sci Lab, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Rius, Bianca Fazio] Univ Campinas Unicamp, Biol Inst, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Filho, Joao Paulo Darela] Sao Paulo State Univ Unesp, Inst Biosci, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Fleischer, Katrin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Dept Biogeochem Signals, Jena, Germany; [Filho, Joao Paulo Darela; Fleischer, Katrin; Rammig, Anja] Tech Univ Munich TUM, Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Hofhansl, Florian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Biodivers & Nat Resources Program, Laxenburg, Laxenburg, Austria; [Domingues, Tomas Ferreira] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Filosofia Ciencias & Letras Ribeirao Preto, Dept Biol, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Rius, Bianca Fazio] Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, Earth Syst Sci Lab, Campinas BR-1308886, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Max Planck Society; Technical University of Munich; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Rius, BF (corresponding author), Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, Earth Syst Sci Lab, Campinas, SP, Brazil.;Rius, BF (corresponding author), Univ Campinas Unicamp, Biol Inst, Campinas, SP, Brazil.;Rius, BF (corresponding author), Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Meteorol & Climat Res Appl Agr, Earth Syst Sci Lab, Campinas BR-1308886, SP, Brazil.",b211466@dac.unicamp.br,"Filho, João Paulo Darela/I-1624-2014; Blanco, Carolina/O-4514-2018","Filho, João Paulo Darela/0000-0002-0277-0370; Rius, Bianca/0000-0002-7623-9152; Blanco, Carolina/0000-0002-8959-2633","Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP [2019/04223-0, 2017/00005-3, 2015/02537-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [88887.177275/2018-00]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [R2060/5-1]; IIASA",Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); IIASA,"This study has been financed by Sao Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP through grants to BFR (2019/04223-0), JPDF (2017/00005-3), and DML (2015/02537-7), related to the AmazonFACE?ME project (labterra.cpa.unicamp.br/amazonface-me/).

The quantity (e.g. biomass production) and quality (e.g. leaf nutrient content) of plants can strongly influence arthropod diversity, but few studies have tried to disentangle such effects. 2. In this study, we examined the independent effects of plant productivity and leaf traits on the taxon richness and abundance of entire arthropod communities and multiple arthropod orders in replicated monocultures of 15 herbaceous species in the Inner Mongolian grassland. 3.Total taxon richness of arthropod communities increased with plant productivity and an increase in a high nutrient content indicator (PC1) of plant leaf traits (e.g. high leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and water contents), but decreased with an increase in a poor nutrient content indicator (PC2) of plant leaf traits (e.g. high leaf lignin content but low SLA). Total abundance of arthropod communities increased with increasing plant productivity but decreased with increasing PC2. 4. Many common, rather than rare arthropod orders, exhibited strong responses to the changes in plant quantity or quality. Taxon richness of Diptera, Neuroptera and Coleoptera responded positively to the increase in plant productivity and PC1, while taxon richness of Hemiptera and Coleoptera responded negatively to the increase in PC2. Abundances of Diptera and Coleoptera responded positively to the increased plant productivity, whereas abundances of Hymenoptera and Hemiptera responded negatively to the increased PC2. The order-specific responses of arthropod richness and abundance to plant quantity or quality reflected the different food requirements and feeding behaviours of arthropods. 5. Our findings demonstrate that plant quantity and quality can independently control richness and abundance of arthropod communities. The changes in plant productivity and nutrient content of different plant species may alter arthropod diversity and community structure, and these changes in turn may have strong cascading effects on multiple functions (e.g. prey, decomposers, pollinators and predators) in terrestrial ecosystems.","[Lu, Xiaoming; Zhao, Xuezhen; Bai, Yongfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xuezhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Lifesci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tachibana, Taiki; Sasaki, Takehiro] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Uchida, Kei] Univ Tokyo, Inst Sustainable Agroecosyst Serv, Nishi Tokyo, Japan; [Bai, Yongfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Yokohama National University; University of Tokyo; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Bai, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yfbai@ibcas.ac.cn,"zhao, xuezhen/GXH-1171-2022; Lu, Xiaoming/AAE-6302-2022; Uchida, Kei/ABE-9706-2021","Lu, Xiaoming/0000-0001-7380-0699; Uchida, Kei/0000-0002-5955-6017; Sasaki, Takehiro/0000-0001-8727-9152","Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region [25712036]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [2020CG0055]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [31630010]; Asahi Glass Foundation","Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Asahi Glass Foundation","The Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists A, Grant/Award Number: 25712036; Science and Technology Transformation Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Grant/Award Number: 2020CG0055; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31630010; the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan; Asahi Glass Foundation",NA,53,3,3,10,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

A number of biodiversity experiments have shown that plant diversity plays a significant role for ecosystem functioning. However, diversity effects on processes involving multi-trophic interactions such as litter decomposition are rather rare. In these experiments, plant diversity is usually categorized into taxonomic units or functional groups. Continuous measures of functional diversity that are based on measurable traits, in contrast, may be a more flexible way to analyse the functional significance of biodiversity. 2. Litter decomposition is a key process in ecosystem biogeochemistry. To understand the consequences of altered biodiversity for ecosystem functioning, it is thus crucial to quantify any potential diversity effects on decomposition processes. 3. I performed several complementary decomposition trials within the BIODiversity and Ecological Processes in Terrestrial Herbaceous ecosystems (BIODEPTH) experiment, which established a gradient of plant species richness and number of functional groups. I hypothesized that decomposition rates increase with increasing plant diversity due to non-additive litter mixing effects and more favourable microenvironmental conditions. 4. Decomposition rates of both standard materials and community-specific litter increased with the number of functional groups and with a continuous measure of functional diversity. Species richness, in contrast, had no or rather small positive effects on decomposition.

Factors affecting the vegetative trait diversity of their plant communities are well studied, but those affecting their floral diversity are not. Local factors, such as land-use intensification and soil characteristics, can greatly influence floral trait diversity in semi-natural grasslands, which in turn can influence pollination function. We selected 16 semi-natural grasslands in France along a local land-use intensification gradient. Floral functional diversity indices were calculated from measurements of five floral traits known to influence interactions with pollinators: flower area, flowering height, floral reflectance, nectar tube depth and nectar sugar production per floral unit. Using linear mixed models, we found a negative influence of phosphorus soil content, and a positive influence of a composite soil variable including soil texture, organic carbon and total nitrogen soil content, on floral functional diversity. However, local land-use intensification did not influence floral functional diversity. Moreover, our results showed a positive relation between floral functional diversity and plant-pollinator interaction frequency as a proxy of pollination function. More specifically, we found a positive influence of the nectar resource diversity (i.e. the variability in production of nectar sugar by flowers) on plant-pollinator interaction frequency. These results, based on a correlative approach and functional diversity indices as measure of functional complementarity, suggest that the diversity of floral traits may promote niche partitioning of pollinators and pollination function approximated by plant-pollinator interaction frequency, and highlight the main role of nectar in this process.","[Goulnik, Jeremie; Plantureux, Sylvain; Villerd, Jean; Michelot-Antalik, Alice] Univ Lorraine, LAE, INRAE, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Thery, Marc] CNRS, UMR 7179, MNHN, Mecanismes Adaptatifs & Evolut, Brunoy, France; [Baude, Mathilde] Univ Orleans, INRAE USC 1328, LBLGC EA 1207, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Delattre, Maud] INRAE Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, UMR MIA Paris, Paris, France; [van Reeth, Colin] Ctr Rech Ecosyst Altitude CREA Mt Blanc, 67 Facets Belvedere, F-74400 Chamonix Mt Blanc, France",INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); INRAE; Universite de Orleans; AgroParisTech; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay,"Goulnik, J (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, LAE, INRAE, F-54000 Nancy, France.",jeremiegoulnik@gmail.com,"Villerd, Jean/ABC-4340-2020","Villerd, Jean/0000-0001-7156-7512; Van Reeth, Colin/0000-0002-7070-9838; Goulnik, Jeremie/0000-0002-4825-8110; Michelot-Antalik, Alice/0000-0002-0134-6754","French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation; Institut National de Recherche pour l'Agriculture, l'Alimentation et l'Environnement (INRAE); Great East region of France; scientific pole A2F","French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation; Institut National de Recherche pour l'Agriculture, l'Alimentation et l'Environnement (INRAE); Great East region of France; scientific pole A2F","We thank the farmers for their authorisation to study their grasslands; Marie-Claire Gegout, Juliette Ducrettet, Ophelie Da Silva, Lucie Sepulchre, Catherine Heinrich, Clara Dumon, Clemence Pechinot, Julien Pierre, Alexis Parret, Jodie Thenard and Claude Gallois for collecting data; Christian Bockstaller, Anne Farruggia and Frederique Louault for help with the land-use intensification index; Phil Whitters and Anne Vallet for Diptera identification; Celine Schott and Catherine Mignolet for RPG sheet; and Ophelie Da Silva for graphics.

However, major knowledge gaps exist about how environmental factors, especially climate and soil abiotic properties, shape plant functional diversity at a regional scale. Furthermore, at those scales the relationships between plant functional and taxonomic diversity have rarely been considered. Here, we used a large database of plant species and functional trait data from 180 temperate grasslands across England, covering a broad range of grassland types, climatic conditions and management intensities, the last having a strong influence on multiple soil variables. Our specific aims were to: (1) identify the dominant environmental factors explaining variation in different facets of plant community functional properties, including community weighted means (CWMs) of functional traits and various multi-trait functional diversity indices; and (2) test whether the relationship between plant functional and taxonomic diversity is mediated by environmental factors at a regional scale. We found that soil abiotic properties (pH and nutrient stocks), but not climate, were the main environmental factors explaining grassland plant functional diversity at a regional scale, with a significant contribution of soil nutrient stoichiometry (N/P ratio). Two indices of plant community functional properties, namely CWMs of specific leaf area and relative growth rate, were explained by interactions between soil pH and N and mean annual precipitation, soil pH soil N and soil N/P ratio. These indices were also negatively related to taxonomic diversity under certain soil abiotic conditions, specifically high soil clay content, pH and N/P. Together, our results indicate that soil abiotic properties rather than climate factors shape plant functional diversity across temperate grassland plant communities at a regional scale. They also suggest that interactions between environmental factors play a significant role in shaping patterns of plant community functional properties. Our findings are of importance for the design and interpretation of future studies using trait and diversity measures as proxies of ecosystem services at regional scales.","[Rodriguez, Antonio; Sebastia, M.

How-ever, few studies have applied this approach to inner saline-alkaline marsh ecosystems where soil saline-alkaline, flooding/drought and nutrients stresses threat ecological functioning. To disentangle the relationships between environmental conditions and ecosystem functioning, a total of 81 plots were investigated across 22 marsh sites dom-inated by Phragmites australis and Bolboschoenus planiculmis in Western Songnen Plain wetlands, China. For both plant communities combined, deep flooding supported communities with higher specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and leaf nitrogen (N) content but lower leaf thickness. On the contrary, high soil salt content induced low leaf N and phos-phorus (P) content, SLA and plant height. Only light acquisition-related trait, plant height and SLA, was the key traits which determined the relationships between ecosystem functioning (aboveground biomass) and saline-alkaline wet-land environment. Yet indirect key traits related nutrient and water acquisition such as leaf thickness, N and P content were also found, and mediated the response of aboveground biomass through the allometric relationships with plant height or SLA. For the individual species community, only plant height was the key trait shared by P. australis and B. planiculmis, indicating the universality of plant height as a key trait for grass and sedge plants to explain how eco -system functioning responds to abiotic factors. Hence, our findings suggest that saltmarsh plants are more inclined to alter light-acquisition traits to mediate the response of ecosystem functioning to environmental changes and that plant height is a particularly useful trait to predict plant productivity in earth system models under future environmen-tal changes in inner saline???alkaline wetlands.","[Liu Ying; Ma Maohua] Chinese Acad Sci, Three Gorges Inst Ecol Environm, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Liu Ying; Liu Bo; Jiang Ming; Lu Xianguo; Lou Yanjing] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China; [Ding Zhi] Southwest Univ, State Cultivat Rase Ecoagr Southwest Mt Land, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chongqing Institute of Green & Intelligent Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Southwest University - China","Lou, YJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.;Ding, Z (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, State Cultivat Rase Ecoagr Southwest Mt Land, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",dingzhi11@mails.ucas.ac.cn; louyj@iga.ac.cn,"Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022",,"Regional innovation and development fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China [U19A2042]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42101074, 42171065]",Regional innovation and development fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Regional innovation and development fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China (U19A2042) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42101074, 42171065) supported this work.",NA,53,0,0,23,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

This is more pronounced in Andean ecosystems, with high forest fragmentation and forest loss rates aggravating the effect. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of precipitation and its interaction with the canopy on nutrient inputs into forests. However, few studies have quantified the potential effects of structural and morphological tree diversity on the dynamics of phosphorous inputs on these ecosystems. In this study, we determined the association between 12 morphological plant functional traits and the movement of water-driven orthophosphate from the canopy into the soil in 20 individuals of five tree species, on single individuals scattered across a human-disturbed montane landscape in the Colombian Andes: Croton magdalenensis, Andesanthus lepidotus, Vismia baccifera and Quercus humboldtii and a commonly planted exotic species Eucalyptus globulus. We quantified PO4-P concentrations in precipitation, throughfall and stemflow in all trees for 14 isolated rainfall events. In general, our results show a general enrichment of PO4-P concentration in the net precipitation after passing through tree canopies. One particular species, C. magdalenensis, an ecological pioneer, had notably higher values of PO4-P concentration. This condition relates, potentially, to a particularly higher epiphyte load, high leaf area and high trichome density. This condition potentially facilitates biogeochemical exchange and improves ecological functions associated with early stages of forest recovery (where pioneer species dominate forest composition). Our results are particularly relevant given that the highest contributions of PO4-P to the soil occur in native species, which become key structures in the recovery of fragmented Andean ecosystems.","[Vasquez-Sogamoso, Santiago] Inst Univ Colegio Mayor Antioquia, Carrera 78 65-46, Medellin, Colombia; [Vasquez-Sogamoso, Santiago; Villegas, Juan Camilo] Univ Antioquia, Escuela Ambiental, Fac Ingn, Grp Invest Ecol Aplicada, Calle 67 53-108, Medellin, Colombia; [Suescun, Diego] Univ Ind Santander Sede Malaga, Inst Proyecc Reg & Educ Distancia IPRED, Cl 20 6-20, Malaga, Colombia",Institucion Universitaria Colegio Mayor de Antioquia; Universidad de Antioquia,"Vasquez-Sogamoso, S (corresponding author), Inst Univ Colegio Mayor Antioquia, Fac Arquitectura Ingn, Carrera 78 65-46, Medellin, Colombia.",santiago.vazquez@colmayor.edu.co,,"Villegas, Juan Camilo/0000-0001-5048-921X","Alejandro Angel Escobar Foundation; University of Antioquia; Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation(MINCIENCIAS)","Alejandro Angel Escobar Foundation; University of Antioquia; Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation(MINCIENCIAS)","Alejandro Angel Escobar Foundation;University of Antioquia; Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation(MINCIENCIAS)",NA,49,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,2023 MAR 17,2023,NA,,,NA,,NA,,,,10.1002/eco.2539,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2539,NA,mar.-23,18,Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,9Y5LP,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000950500300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In savanna systems, Macrotermes termites, through forming spatially explicit mounds with unique woody plant assemblages, emerge as important sources of such heterogeneity. Despite a growing consensus regarding the importance of functional diversity (FD) to ecosystem processes, no study has quantified how termite mounds affect woody plant FD. We address whether termite mounds alter the distribution of functional traits, and increase FD of woody plant communities within Africa's largest savanna woodland, the 2.7 million km(2) miombo system. Using plant traits that change according to soil resources (for example, water and nutrients), and disturbance (for example, fire and elephant herbivory), we identified response functional groups and compared relative representation of these groups between mound and matrix habitats. We also asked whether mound and matrix habitats differed in their contribution to FD within the system. Although species representing most functional groups were found in both mound and matrix habitats, relative abundance of functional groups differed between mound and matrix. Mound plant assemblages had greater response diversity to soil resources than matrix plots, but there was no difference in response diversity to disturbance. High trait values on mounds included tree height, leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and palatability. Species with root ectomycorrhizae dominated the matrix. In conclusion, these small patches of nutrient-enriched substrate emerge as drivers of FD in above-ground woody plant communities.","[Joseph, Grant S.; Cumming, Graeme S.; Cumming, David H.

Researchers often predict fish population dynamics using species-level life-history parameters that are treated as fixed over time, while ignoring the impact of intraspecific variation on ecosystem dynamics. However, there is increasing recognition of the need to include processes operating at ecosystem levels (changes in drivers of productivity) while also accounting for variation over space, time and among individuals. To address similar challenges, community ecologists studying plants, insects and other taxa increasingly measure phenotypic characteristics of individual animals that affect fitness or ecological function (termed functional traits). Here, we review the history of trait-based methods in fish and other taxa, and argue that fisheries science could see benefits by integrating trait-based approaches within existing fisheries analyses. We argue that measuring and modelling functional traits can improve estimates of population and community dynamics, and rapidly detect responses to fishing and environmental drivers. We support this claim using three concrete examples: how trait-based approaches could account for time-varying parameters in population models; improve fisheries management and harvest control rules; and inform size-based models of marine communities. We then present a step-by-step primer for how trait-based methods could be adapted to complement existing models and analyses in fisheries science. Finally, we call for the creation and expansion of publicly available trait databases to facilitate adapting trait-based methods in fisheries science, to complement existing public databases of life-history parameters for marine organisms.","[Barnett, Lewis A.

Both propositions have already yielded support but their relative importance and how they impact biomass production in field situations is still not well known. This study therefore tested (i) whether or not there was a close relationship between biomass production and the community-weighted mean trait values (CWM), as expected from the biomass ratio hypothesis, and (ii) the impact of the functional diversity (FDQ) on biomass production, which is expected to be positive according to the diversity-hypothesis. The study considered a range of plant assemblages occurring in a wet grassland and five above-ground and four below-ground plant traits were measured to characterize their functional structure. The effects of species diversity, soil water content, soil nitrogen availability and grazing intensity on biomass production were also determined. We showed that biomass production was not related either to species richness and diversity or to any of the resource and disturbance parameters considered. Conversely, the functional structure was found to explain up to 55% of the variability of the biomass production. The results obtained clearly supported the biomass-ratio hypothesis. Functional diversity was mainly found to negatively impact biomass production with only poor support to the diversity hypothesis. We suggest that such a dilution effect of increasing FDQ on community primary production may be typical of fertile habitats. In order to significantly improve our understanding of the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem processes, further studies should consider plant assemblages that have been shaped over the long term and habitats across a wide range of productivity.","[Chanteloup, Pierre; Bonis, Anne] Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO OSU Rennes 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Bonis, A (autor correspondente), Univ Rennes 1, UMR CNRS ECOBIO OSU Rennes 6553, Campus Beaulieu, F-35042 Rennes, France.",anne.bonis@univ-rennes1.fr,"Bonis, Anne/AAJ-1009-2021","Bonis, Anne/0000-0001-5034-9575",French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche,French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche,"PC was funded by a grant from the French Ministere de l'enseignement Superieur et de la recherche.

It is still poorly understood how fast interlinked ecosystem processes respond to altered environmental conditions, if these responses occur gradually or suddenly when thresholds are exceeded, and if the patterns of the responses will reach a stable state. We conducted an irrigation experiment in the Pfynwald, Switzerland from 2003-2018. A naturally dry Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest was irrigated with amounts that doubled natural precipitation, thus releasing the forest stand from water limitation. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative understanding on how different traits and functions of individual trees and the whole ecosystem responded to increased water availability, and how the patterns and magnitudes of these responses developed over time. We found that the response magnitude, the temporal trajectory of responses, and the length of initial lag period prior to significant response largely varied across traits. We detected rapid and stronger responses from aboveground tree traits (e.g., tree-ring width, needle length, and crown transparency) compared to belowground tree traits (e.g., fine-root biomass). The altered aboveground traits during the initial years of irrigation increased the water demand and trees adjusted by increasing root biomass during the later years of irrigation, resulting in an increased survival rate of Scots pine trees in irrigated plots. The irrigation also stimulated ecosystem-level foliar decomposition rate, fungal fruit body biomass, and regeneration abundances of broadleaved tree species. However, irrigation did not promote the regeneration of Scots pine trees, which are reported to be vulnerable to extreme droughts. Our results provide extensive evidence that tree- and ecosystem-level responses were pervasive across a number of traits on long-term temporal scales. However, after reaching a peak, the magnitude of these responses either decreased or reached a new stable state, providing important insights into how resource alterations could change the system functioning and its boundary conditions.","[Bose, Arun K.; Rigling, Andreas; Gessler, Arthur; Hagedorn, Frank; Brunner, Ivano; Feichtinger, Linda; Egli, Simon; Etzold, Sophia; Gossner, Martin M.; Guidi, Claudia; Meusburger, Katrin; Peter, Martina; Saurer, Matthias; Scherrer, Daniel; Schleppi, Patrick; Schoenbeck, Leonie; Vogel, Michael E.; Arx, Georg; Wermelinger, Beat; Wohlgemuth, Thomas; Zweifel, Roman; Schaub, Marcus] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Bose, Arun K.] Khulna Univ, Forestry & Wood Technol Discipline, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Rigling, Andreas; Gessler, Arthur; Gossner, Martin M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bigler, Christof; Levesque, Mathieu] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Forest Ecol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schoenbeck, Leonie] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn ENAC, Plant Ecol Res Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Khulna University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","Bose, AK (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.;Bose, AK (corresponding author), Khulna Univ, Forestry & Wood Technol Discipline, Khulna, Bangladesh.",arun.bose@wsl.ch,"Bigler, Christof/C-6271-2009; Schönbeck, Leonie C/AAM-4408-2020; Peter, Martina/G-2284-2018; von Arx, Georg/E-1785-2012; Rigling, Andreas/B-9665-2013; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/E-6588-2016; Bose, Arun/AAJ-9711-2021; Brunner, Ivano L./J-8661-2014; Meusburger, Katrin/AHA-6763-2022; Scherrer, Daniel/K-3416-2013; Schaub, Marcus/E-4874-2012; Schleppi, Patrick/E-6751-2011; Levesque, Mathieu/K-1681-2013; Gossner, Martin M./J-2730-2015; Etzold, Sophia/N-9828-2017","Bigler, Christof/0000-0003-3757-6356; Schönbeck, Leonie C/0000-0001-9576-254X; Peter, Martina/0000-0002-6365-6889; von Arx, Georg/0000-0002-8566-4599; Rigling, Andreas/0000-0003-1944-4042; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Wohlgemuth, Thomas/0000-0002-4623-0894; Brunner, Ivano L./0000-0003-3436-995X; Meusburger, Katrin/0000-0003-4623-6249; Scherrer, Daniel/0000-0001-9983-7510; Schaub, Marcus/0000-0002-0158-8892; Schleppi, Patrick/0000-0002-3578-6563; Levesque, Mathieu/0000-0003-0273-510X; Gossner, Martin M./0000-0003-1516-6364; Etzold, Sophia/0000-0002-5383-2228; KANTI BOSE, ARUN/0000-0001-8581-1651; Guidi, Claudia/0000-0003-3947-808X","Marie Skodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship [749051-REFOREST]; Federal Office for the Environment FOEN [00.0365.

However, so far it has been difficult to combine field-based approaches assessing traits at the level of plant individuals with limited spatial coverage and approaches using remote sensing (RS) with complete spatial coverage but assessing traits at the level of vegetation pixels rather than individuals. By delineating all individual-tree crowns within a temperate forest site and then assigning RS-derived trait measures to these trees, we combine the two approaches, allowing us to use general linear models to estimate the influence of taxonomic or environmental variation on between- and within-species variation across contiguous space. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy and laser scanning to collect individual-tree RS data from a mixed conifer-angiosperm forest on a mountain slope extending over 5.5 ha and covering large environmental gradients in elevation as well as light and soil conditions. We derived three biochemical (leaf chlorophyll, carotenoids, and water content) and three architectural traits (plant area index, foliage-height diversity, and canopy height), which had previously been used to characterize plant function, from the RS data. We then quantified the contributions of taxonomic and environmental variation and their interaction to trait variation and partitioned the remaining within-species trait variation into smaller-scale spatial and residual variation. We also investigated the correlation between functional trait and phylogenetic distances at the between-species level. The forest consisted of 13 tree species of which eight occurred in sufficient abundance for quantitative analysis. On average, taxonomic variation between species accounted for more than 15% of trait variation in biochemical traits but only around 5% (still highly significant) in architectural traits. Biochemical trait distances among species also showed a stronger correlation with phylogenetic distances than did architectural trait distances. Light and soil conditions together with elevation explained slightly more variation than taxonomy across all traits, but in particular increased plant area index (light) and reduced canopy height (elevation). Except for foliage-height diversity, all traits were affected by significant interactions between taxonomic and environmental variation, the different responses of the eight species to the within-site environmental gradients potentially contributing to the coexistence of the eight abundant species. We conclude that with high-resolution RS data it is possible to delineate individual-tree crowns within a forest and thus assess functional traits derived from RS data at individual level. With this precondition fulfilled, it is then possible to apply tools commonly used in field-based trait ecology to partition trait variation among individuals into taxonomic and potentially even genetic variation, environmental variation, and interactions between the two. The method proposed here presents a promising way of assessing individual-based trait information with complete spatial coverage and thus allowing analysis of functional diversity at different scales. This information can help to better understand processes shaping community structure, productivity, and stability of forests.","[Guillen-Escriba, Carla; Schneider, Fabian D.; Schmid, Bernhard; Morsdorf, Felix; Hueni, Andreas; Schaepman, Michael E.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schneider, Fabian D.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Tedder, Andrew] Univ Bradford, Sch Chem & Biosci, Fac Life Sci, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Furrer, Reinhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Math, Zurich, Switzerland; [Furrer, Reinhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Computat Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Niklaus, Pascal A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of Bradford; University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Guillen-Escriba, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Zurich, Switzerland.",cguillenescriba@gmail.com,"Furrer, Reinhard/A-4580-2011; Niklaus, Pascal A/G-5786-2010; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Tedder, Andrew/H-6678-2019; Schaepman, Michael/HPC-6857-2023; Furrer, Reinhard/N-3027-2019; Fabian, Schneider/AGV-2916-2022; Hueni, Andreas/A-4875-2018; Schaepman, Michael/B-9213-2009","Furrer, Reinhard/0000-0002-6319-2332; Niklaus, Pascal A/0000-0002-2360-1357; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Tedder, Andrew/0000-0002-7378-4673; Furrer, Reinhard/0000-0002-6319-2332; Hueni, Andreas/0000-0002-4283-2484; Schaepman, Michael/0000-0002-9627-9565; Morsdorf, Felix/0000-0001-6713-1599",University of Zurich Research Priority Program on 'Global Change and Biodiversity' (URPP GCB),University of Zurich Research Priority Program on 'Global Change and Biodiversity' (URPP GCB),University of Zurich Research Priority Program on 'Global Change and Biodiversity' (URPP GCB),NA,112,6,6,4,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Owing to their remoteness, however, ecological key-processes are less understood as in the tropical lowlands. Remote sensing allows modeling of variables related to spatial patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g., biomass) and ecosystem functioning (e.g., functional leaf traits). However, at a landscape scale most studies conducted so far are based on airborne remote sensing data which is often available only locally and for one time-point. In contrast, multispectral satellites at moderate spectral and spatial resolutions are able to provide spatially continuous and repeated observations. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of Landsat-8 imagery in modeling tropical montane forest biomass, its productivity and selected canopy traits. Topographical, spectral and textural metrics were derived as predictors. To train and validate the models, in-situ data was sampled in 54 permanent plots in forests of southern Ecuador distributed within three study sites at 1000 m, 2000 m and 3000 m a.s.l. We used partial least squares regressions to model and map all response variables. Along the whole elevation gradient biomass and productivity models explained 31%, 43%, 69% and 63% of variance in aboveground biomass, annual wood production, fine litter production and aboveground net primary production, respectively. Regression models of canopy traits measured as community weighted means explained 62%, 78%, 65% and 65% of variance in leaf toughness, specific leaf area, foliar N concentration, and foliar P concentration, respectively. Models at single study sites hardly explained variation in aboveground biomass and the annual wood production indicating that these measures are mainly determined by the change of forest types along with elevation. In contrast, the models of fine litter production and canopy traits explained between 8%-85% in variation depending on the study site. We found spectral metrics, in particular a vegetation index using the red and the green band to provide complementary information to topographical metrics. The model performances for estimating leaf toughness, biochemical canopy traits and related fine litter production all improved when adding spectral information. Our findings therefore revealed that differences in fine litter production and canopy traits in our study area are driven by local changes in vegetation edaphically induced by topography. We conclude that Landsat-derived metrics are useful in modeling fine litter production and biochemical canopy traits, in a topographically and ecologically complex tropical montane forest.","[Wallis, Christine I.

However, an increasing number of studies are pointing out the selectivity potential of plant hosts. Plant life form, determined by plant life history traits, seems to drive the AM fungal community composition. The AM fungi also exhibit a wide diversity of functional traits known to be responsible for their distribution in natural ecosystems. However, little is known about the role of plant and fungal traits driving the resultant symbiotic assemblages. With the aim of testing the feedback relationship between plant and fungal traits on the resulting AM fungal community, we inoculated three different plant life forms, i.e. annual herbs, perennial herbs and perennial semi-woody plants, with AM fungal communities sampled in different seasons. We hypothesized that the annual climate variation will induce changes in the mean traits of the AM fungal communities present in the soil throughout the year. Furthermore, the association of plants with different life forms with AM fungi with contrasting life history traits will show certain preferences according to reciprocal traits of the plants and fungi. We found changes in the AM fungal community throughout the year, which were differentially disrupted by disturbance and altered by plant growth form and plant biomass. Both plant and fungal traits clearly contributed to the resultant AM fungal communities. The revealed process can have implications for the functioning of ecosystems since changes in dominant plant life forms or climatic variables could influence the traits of AM fungal communities in soil and hence ecosystem processes.","[Lopez-Garcia, Alvaro; Azcon-Aguilar, Concepcion; Barea, Jose M.] CSIC, Estn Expt Zaidin, Soil Microbiol & Symbiot Syst Dept, E-18008 Granada, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental del Zaidin (EEZ),"Lopez-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Sect Terr Ecol, Dept Biol, Univ Pk 15,Bldg 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",lopez.garcia.alvaro@gmail.com,"Azcón, Concepción/H-5873-2015; García, Álvaro López/J-9190-2014; Barea, Jose Miguel/H-5893-2015","Azcón, Concepción/0000-0003-3041-8566; García, Álvaro López/0000-0001-8267-3572; Barea, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-5021-4718","Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Spanish government [CGL-2009-08825]","Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain); Spanish government(Spanish Government)","Dr Alvaro Lopez-Garcia thanks the Formacion de Personal Investigador Programme (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Spain) for financial support.

However, little is known about feedback effects of biodiversity on survival and its dependence on functional traits and interannual climatic variability. With an individual-based dataset from a large subtropical forest biodiversity experiment, we evaluated how species richness, functional traits and time-dependent covariates affected annual tree survival rates from age 3-12 (years) after planting 39 species across a diversity gradient from 1 to 2, 4, 8 and 16 tree species. We found that overall survival rates marginally increased with diversity at the plot level, with large variation among plots within diversity levels. Significant variation among species in survival responses to diversity and changes in these responses with age were related to species functional traits and climatic conditions. Generally, survival rates of conservative species (evergreen, late-successional species with thick leaves and high carbon to nitrogen ratio but low specific leaf area, leaf phosphorus and hydraulic conductivity) increased with diversity, age and yearly precipitation, whereas acquisitive species showed opposite responses. Synthesis. Our results indicate that interactions between diversity, species functional traits and yearly climatic conditions can balance survival among species in diverse forests. Planting mixtures of species that differ in functional traits in afforestation projects may lead to a positive feedback loop where biodiversity maintains biodiversity, together with its previously reported beneficial effects on ecosystem functioning.","[Liu, Xiaojuan; Chen, Lei; Li, Shan; Bongers, Franca J.; Liang, Yu; Tang, Ting; Xue, Yujie; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuanyuan; Castro-Izaguirre, Nadia] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Yang, Bo] Jingdezhen Univ, Jiangxi Key Lab Plant Resources & Biodivers, Jingdezhen, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yuxin] Xiamen Univ, Coll Environm & Ecol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coastal & Wetland Ecosyst, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Schnabel, Florian; Trogisch, Stefan; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Schnabel, Florian] Univ Leipzig, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers, Leipzig, Germany; [Tang, Ting; Ma, Keping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Yujie] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Trogisch, Stefan; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Staab, Michael] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Darmstadt, Germany; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Zurich, Switzerland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; University of Zurich; Xiamen University; Leipzig University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Forestry University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Technical University of Darmstadt; University of Zurich","Ma, KP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Ma, KP (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Schmid, B (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Remote Sensing Labs, Zurich, Switzerland.",bernhard.schmid@uzh.ch; kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Staab, Michael/I-6544-2019; Trogisch, Stefan/D-4358-2017; Schnabel, Florian/R-8766-2019; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; Chen, Yuxin/H-8672-2019; Chen, Lei/C-3543-2012","Staab, Michael/0000-0003-0894-7576; Schnabel, Florian/0000-0001-8452-4001; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Chen, Yuxin/0000-0003-0658-7562; Yang, Bo/0000-0002-6288-445X; Chen, Lei/0000-0002-0625-4808; Bongers, Franca/0000-0001-9517-4932",CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team [JCTD-2018-06]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0605103]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870409]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019082]; International Research Training Group TreeDi [319936945/GRK2324],CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team; National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; International Research Training Group TreeDi,"CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team, Grant/Award Number: JCTD-2018-06; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFA0605103; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31870409; the International Research Training Group TreeDi, Grant/Award Number: DFG, 319936945/GRK2324; the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB31000000; the University of Zurich Research Priority Program on Global Change and Biodiversity, Grant/Award Number: URPP GCB; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 2019082",NA,55,0,0,28,83,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

To explore the role of plants as mediators of these emissions, we tested whether and how N2O emissions are dependent on grass species richness and/or specific grass species composition in the absence and presence of urine deposition. We hypothesized that: (i) N2O emissions relate negatively to plant productivity; (ii) four-species mixtures have lower emissions than monocultures (as they are expected to be more productive); (iii) emissions are lowest in combinations of species with diverging root morphology and high root biomass; and (iv) the identity of the key species that reduce N2O emissions is dependent on urine deposition. We established monocultures and two- and four-species mixtures of common grass species with diverging functional traits: Lolium perenne L. (Lp), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (Fa), Phleum pratense L. (Php) and Poa trivialis L. (Pt), and quantified N2O emissions for 42days. We found no relation between plant species richness and N2O emissions. However, N2O emissions were significantly reduced in specific plant species combinations. In the absence of urine, plant communities of Fa+Php acted as a sink for N2O, whereas the monocultures of these species constituted a N2O source. With urine application Lp+Pt plant communities reduced (P<0.001) N2O emissions by 44% compared to monocultures of Lp. Reductions in N2O emissions by species mixtures could be explained by total biomass productivity and by complementarity in root morphology. This study shows that plant species composition is a key component underlying N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems. Selection of specific grass species combinations in the context of the expected nitrogen deposition regimes may therefore provide a key for mitigation of N2O emissions.","[Abalos, Diego] Tech Univ Madrid, ETSI Agronomos, Madrid 28040, Spain; [De Deyn, Gerlinde B.; Kuyper, Thomas W.; van Groenigen, Jan Willem] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Wageningen University & Research,"Abalos, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, ETSI Agronomos, Ciudad Univ, Madrid 28040, Spain.",diego.abalos@upm.es,"De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009; Van Groenigen, Jan Willem/H-3037-2012; De Deyn, Gerlinde/AFI-8702-2022; De Deyn, Gerlinde/F-7080-2017","De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; Van Groenigen, Jan Willem/0000-0001-9637-0601; De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912; De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912; Abalos, Diego/0000-0002-4189-5563",VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research/Earth and Life Sciences (NWO-ALW); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [AGL2009-08412-AGR]; EU; European Community,"VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research/Earth and Life Sciences (NWO-ALW)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); EU(European Commission); European Community(European Commission)","This study was supported by a personal VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research/Earth and Life Sciences (NWO-ALW) to Jan Willem van Groenigen.

To understand the underlying causes of these changes and predict the long-term resilience of the ecosystem to withstand future disturbances, we can evaluate changes in diversity and composition from fossil pollen records. Although diversity can be well estimated from pollen in temperate ecosystems, this is less clear for the hyperdiverse tropics. Moreover, it remains unknown whether functional composition of plant assemblages can be accurately predicted from pollen assemblage composition. Here, we evaluate how community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and diversity indices change along elevation. Location Amazon-Andes elevation gradient in Peru. Methods We used 82 modern pollen samples and 59 vegetation plots along the elevation gradient, and calculated CWM traits and diversity indices for each pollen sample and vegetation plot. We also quantified the degree to which taxa are over- or underrepresented by their pollen, by dividing the relative pollen abundance by the relative basal area abundance in the nearby vegetation survey plots (i.e. the R-rel values). Results We found that CWM wood density increased, and CWM adult height and leaf area decreased with elevation. This change was well predicted by pollen assemblages, indicating that CWM trait-environment relationships based on pollen abundance data provide meaningful results. Diversity (richness, Shannon and Simpson) decreased with elevation for vegetation plots, but these trends could not be observed from pollen assemblages. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that more research is needed to develop methods that lead to accurate diversity estimates from pollen data in these tropical ecosystems, but that CWM traits can be calculated from pollen data to assess spatial shifts in functional composition. This opens opportunities to calculate CWM traits from fossil pollen data sets in the tropics, with broad implications for improving our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics, functioning and resilience through time.","[van der Sande, Masha T.; Bush, Mark B.] Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [van der Sande, Masha T.; McMichael, Crystal H.; Gosling, William] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Sande, Masha T.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Urrego, Dunia H.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Silman, Miles; Garcia Cabrera, Karina] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Farfan-Rios, William] Washington Univ, Living Earth Collaborat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Farfan-Rios, William] Missouri Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Sustainable Dev, St Louis, MO USA; [Farfan-Rios, William] Univ Nacl San Antonio Abad Cusco, Herbario Vargaz CUZ, Escuela Profes Biol, Cuzco, Peru; [Shenkin, Alexander; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog Environm, Oxford, England",Florida Institute of Technology; University of Amsterdam; Wageningen University & Research; University of Exeter; Wake Forest University; Washington University (WUSTL); Missouri Botanical Gardens; Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco; University of Oxford,"van der Sande, MT (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Inst Global Ecol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.",masha.vandersande@wur.nl,"Shenkin, Alexander/AAQ-4166-2021; Urrego, Dunia H./A-6545-2010; Shenkin, Alexander/L-1653-2017; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009; Gosling, William/AAB-2761-2020; Farfan-Rios, William/J-9881-2015","Shenkin, Alexander/0000-0003-2358-9367; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Farfan-Rios, William/0000-0002-3196-0317; van der Sande, Masha/0000-0002-6845-2308; McMichael, Crystal/0000-0002-1064-1499; Urrego, Dunia H./0000-0001-7938-5529",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [Rubicon 019.171LW.023]; NERC [NE/J023418/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/J023418/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: Rubicon 019.171LW.023",NA,72,3,3,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

The optimal timing of leaf senescence is crucial to both minimise risks of low temperature events and to maximise carbon gain during the growing season. As abiotic conditions are currently changing at unprecedented rates, it is important to study how leaf senescence of different species is responding to these changes in order to forecast future growing season length and carbon sequestration potentials. In contrast to flowering phenology, data on autumn events are scarce and even more so for herbaceous than for woody plants, thus more information on this phenological stage is urgently needed. We studied leaf senescence in 632 populations from 17 herbaceous species located along elevational gradients. We focussed on the beginning (5% of the population senesce, LS5) and peak (50% senesce, LS50) of leaf senescence. To see whether we can predict species-specific changes, we studied the link between LS5 and LS50 and flowering phenology as well as leaf functional traits related to plant performance. We looked at first and last flowering day and flowering duration as well as the traits specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), area-based leaf nitrogen and carbon content, carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) and the stomatal pore area index. We found species-specific slopes of the beginning of leaf senescence along the elevational gradient. The peak of leaf senescence was uniformly delayed with increasing elevation across all species. Flowering phenology as well as leaf functional traits had a close relationship with leaf senescence and thus can be used to forecast species-specific responses to changes in abiotic conditions. High SLA and high leaf nitrogen were related to earlier senescence while high LDMC, high Delta C-13 and high stomatal pore area index were related to later senescence. Synthesis. The link between senescence, flowering phenology and plant functional traits will help to fine-tune predictions of future growing season length and ecosystem function. To date, most analyses are based on spring phenology and traits, for which data are more abundant than data on autumn senescence.","[Bucher, Solveig Franziska; Roemermann, Christine] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut Herbarium Haussknecht & Bot Ga, Dept Plant Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Roemermann, Christine] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Bucher, SF (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut Herbarium Haussknecht & Bot Ga, Dept Plant Biodivers, Jena, Germany.",solveig.franziska.bucher@uni-jena.de,,"Bucher, Solveig Franziska/0000-0002-2303-4583; Romermann, Christine/0000-0003-3471-0951",Eliteforderung des Landes Bayern; University of Regensburg; University of Jena; Bavarian State Forest Enterprise; district government of upper Bavaria; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; Projekt DEAL,Eliteforderung des Landes Bayern; University of Regensburg; University of Jena; Bavarian State Forest Enterprise; district government of upper Bavaria; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig; Projekt DEAL,"We would like to thank the members of the former Institute of Systematic Botany of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena for practical assistance, fruitful discussions and support, most of all Birgit Lang and Patrizia Konig.

BEF research first targeted the implications of the ongoing loss of biodiversity for ecosystems and humans. Terrestrial ecology has played a leading role in this field, whereas the contribution of riverine science to the debate has been more limited. Nevertheless, a considerable merit of stream ecology has been to consider a wide range of ecological groups (riparian litter producers, aquatic micro-fungi, macroinvertebrates, and fishes). Through a meta-analysis of these unique data, we show that the relative importance of species number versus assemblage composition increases as we go towards higher trophic levels. Whether this pattern is general or specific to stream ecosystems needs to be evaluated through cross-ecosystem comparisons looking more closely at mechanistic processes. It is evident from stream studies that trophic and non-trophic (e. g. facilitation) interactions govern the functional consequences of biodiversity. These studies also indicate that richness-function relationships are altered by a multitude of factors, such as evenness, non-taxonomic diversity (genetic/phenotypic diversity), species extinction order, the environmental context, as well as experimental setups. This review highlights the relevance of stream ecology to BEF research.

However, inference that complementarity drives this relationship is often based on statistical modelling or the use of functional diversity indices and these methods do not consider resource capture or use among individuals from various species within a community. Here I introduce functional-structural plant models as tool to study species complementarity in light capture and use in mixed-species forests. These models consider the interplay between structure, physiology and the environment in 3D and scale from organ-specific characteristics to tree and community performance. Functional-structural plant models that represent mixed-species forests have therefore the potential to disentangle the effects of structural and functional differences among species on community light capture and use using the 3D setting of the forest. Knowing how community light capture and use in mixed-species forests depends on structural and functional differences among species will shed light on the potential of species complementarity in light capture and use to drive species richness-productivity relationships.

However, the form of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) and how relationships change with environmental change is poorly understood. This limits our ability to predict the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, particularly in real-world marine ecosystems that are species rich, and where multiple ecosystem functions are represented by multiple indicators. We investigated spatial variation in BEF relationships across a 300 000 m(2) intertidal sandflat by nesting experimental manipulations of sediment pore water nitrogen concentration into sites with contrasting macro-benthic community composition. Our results highlight the significance of many different elements of biodiversity associated with environmental characteristics, community structure, functional diversity, ecological traits or particular species (ecosystem engineers) to important functions of coastal marine sediments (benthic oxygen consumption, ammonium pore water concentrations and flux across the sediment-water interface). Using the BEF relationships developed from our experiment, we demonstrate patchiness across a landscape in functional performance and the potential for changes in the location of functional hot and cold spots with increasing nutrient loading that have important implications for mapping and predicating change in functionality and the concomitant delivery of ecosystem services.","[Thrush, Simon F.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Hewitt, Judi E.; Lohrer, A.

Specifically, the sequestration of carbon in soils has often been advocated as a solution to mitigate the steady increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere as a key driver of climate change. However, urban ecosystems are also characterized by an often high level of ecological novelty due to profound human-mediated changes, such as the presence of high numbers of non-native species, impervious surfaces or other disturbances. Yet it is poorly understood whether and how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning and services of urban soils under these novel conditions. In this study, we assessed the influence of above- and below-ground diversity, as well as urbanization and plant invasions, on multifunctionality and organic carbon stocks of soils in non-manipulated grasslands along an urbanization gradient in Berlin, Germany. We focused on plant diversity (measured as species richness and functional trait diversity) and, in addition, on soil organism diversity as a potential mediator for the relationship of plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results showed positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon stocks along the entire gradient. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon by increasing the diversity of below-ground organisms. These positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil fauna were not restricted to native plant species only, but were also exerted by non-native species, although to a lesser degree. Synthesis. We conclude that enhancing diversity in plants and soil fauna of urban grasslands can increase the multifunctionality of urban soils and also add to their often underestimated but very valuable role in mitigating effects of climate change.","[Schittko, Conrad; Heger, Tina] Univ Potsdam, Biodivers Res Systemat Bot, Potsdam, Germany; [Schittko, Conrad; Bernard-Verdier, Maud; Heger, Tina; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Berlin, Germany; [Schittko, Conrad; Onandia, Gabriela; Bernard-Verdier, Maud; Heger, Tina; Jeschke, Jonathan M.; Kowarik, Ingo; Maass, Stefanie; Joshi, Jasmin] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany; [Onandia, Gabriela] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Res Platform Data, Muncheberg, Germany; [Bernard-Verdier, Maud; Heger, Tina; Jeschke, Jonathan M.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany; [Heger, Tina] Tech Univ Munich, Restorat Ecol, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Kowarik, Ingo] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, Ecosyst Sci Plant Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Maass, Stefanie] Univ Potsdam, Plant Ecol & Conservat Biol, Potsdam, Germany; [Joshi, Jasmin] Eastern Switzerland Univ Appl Sci, Inst Landscape & Open Space, Rapperswil, Switzerland",University of Potsdam; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Free University of Berlin; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Schittko, C (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Biodivers Res Systemat Bot, Potsdam, Germany.;Schittko, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Berlin, Germany.;Schittko, C (corresponding author), Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany.",conrad.schittko@igb-berlin.de,"Heger, Tina/AAH-4802-2019","Heger, Tina/0000-0002-5522-5632; Schittko, Conrad/0000-0002-2200-8762; Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465; Jeschke, Jonathan/0000-0003-3328-4217; ONANDIA, GABRIELA/0000-0001-9597-1923; Kowarik, Ingo/0000-0002-8251-7163",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung [01LC1501A-H],Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 01LC1501A-H",NA,134,4,4,53,165,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Here we created a continuous gradient of litter chemistry trait variability within species mixtures to assess effects of litter dissimilarity on three related processes in a natural stream: litter decomposition, fungal biomass accrual in the litter, and nitrogen and phosphorus immobilization. Litter from a pool of eight leaf species was analyzed for chemistry traits affecting decomposition (lignin, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and assembled in all of the 28 possible two-species combinations. Litter dissimilarity was characterized in terms of a range of trait-diversity measures, using Euclidean and Gower distances and dendrogram-based indices. We found large differences in decomposition rates among leaf species, but no significant relationships between decomposition rate of individual leaf species and litter trait dissimilarity, irrespective of whether decomposition was mediated by microbes alone or by both microbes and litter-consuming invertebrates. Likewise, no effects of trait dissimilarity emerged on either fungal biomass accrual or changes during decomposition of nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations in individual leaf species. In line with recent meta-analyses, these results provide support for the contention that litter diversity effects on decomposition, at least in streams, are less pronounced than effects on terrestrial primary productivity.","[Frainer, Andre; Moretti, Marcelo S.; Xu, Wenjing; Gessner, Mark O.] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Frainer, Andre; Xu, Wenjing; Gessner, Mark O.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol IBZ, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Frainer, Andre] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, BR-90150197 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Frainer, Andre] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90740 Umea, Sweden; [Frainer, Andre] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Moretti, Marcelo S.] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Biol, BR-30161970 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Moretti, Marcelo S.] Univ Vila Velha, Lab Aquat Insect Ecol, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, Brazil; [Xu, Wenjing] Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Engn, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Gessner, Mark O.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Expt Limnol, D-16775 Stechlin, Germany; [Gessner, Mark O.] Berlin Inst Technol TU Berlin, Dept Ecol, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Umea University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Centro Universitario Vila Velha; Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Technical University of Berlin,"Frainer, A (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",andre.frainer@slu.se,"Frainer, André/G-4545-2014; Moretti, Marcelo/H-6148-2012","Frainer, André/0000-0002-3703-7152; Moretti, Marcelo/0000-0003-1994-2105",CAPES (Brazil); Swiss Federal Commission for Scholarships for Foreign Students (CFBE); CAPES; CNPq (Brazil); CFBE; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [31ED30-114213],CAPES (Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Swiss Federal Commission for Scholarships for Foreign Students (CFBE); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq (Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CFBE; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank M.

Suppression of pathogens is known to be context-dependent and to vary between plant species, yet the significance of plant identity in shaping rhizosphere bacterial functioning in multi-species communities is largely unknown. We questioned whether the activity of a rhizosphere bacterium in producing biocontrol compounds varies with plant identity in a plant diversity gradient. We set up a gnotobiotic microcosm experiment with the model rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas protegens CHA0, an important biocontrol agent, and investigated the effects of plant identity and diversity on its production of biocontrol compounds. Using GFP-based reporter fusions, we assessed gene expression linked to the production of the biocontrol compounds 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyrrolnitrin and hydrogen cyanide. The expression of genes coding for biocontrol compounds was driven to a large extent by plant identity and this effect persisted along the plant species richness gradient for all tested genes. Notably, the effect of certain plant identities varied between the three tested genes, indicating a selective impact of plant species on bacterial gene expression. However, some plant species, such as Lolium perenne, consistently stimulated bacterial gene expression irrespective of the diversity of the plant community. Our results indicate that the presence of certain plant species within a community disproportionately impacts biocontrol traits expressed by rhizosphere bacteria, providing new insight into the patterns driving plant health and productivity.","[Latz, Ellen; Scheu, Stefan] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Expt Interact Ecol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Jousset, Alexandre] Univ Utrecht, Inst Environm Biol Ecol & Biodivers, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Gottingen; Leipzig University; Utrecht University,"Latz, E (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Theory Biodovers Sci, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",ellen.latz@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Scheu, Stefan/H-7049-2015; Jousset, Alexandre/C-7607-2011; Latz, Ellen/O-2382-2014; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Latz, Eicke/H-3951-2014","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Latz, Eicke/0000-0003-1488-5666",German Science Foundation [JO 935/2-1]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) - German Science Foundation [FZT 118],German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) - German Science Foundation,"We thank Joachim Becker, Susanne Boning-Klein and Guido Humpert for their support in conducting the experiment and Robert Koller for the stimulating discussions.

However, the mechanistic link between GPP and SIF is not completely understood. We analyzed the structural and functional factors controlling the emission of SIF at 760 nm (F-760) in a Mediterranean grassland manipulated with nutrient addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) or nitrogen-phosphorous (NP). Using the soil-canopy observation of photosynthesis and energy (SCOPE) model, we investigated how nutrient-induced changes in canopy structure (i.e. changes in plant forms abundance that influence leaf inclination distribution function, LIDF) and functional traits (e.g. N content in dry mass of leaves, N%, Chlorophyll a+b concentration (Cab) and maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax)) affected the observed linear relationship between F760 and GPP. We conclude that the addition of nutrients imposed a change in the abundance of different plant forms and biochemistry of the canopy that controls F760. Changes in canopy structure mainly control the GPP-F760 relationship, with a secondary effect of Cab and Vcmax. In order to exploit F760 data to model GPP at the global/regional scale, canopy structural variability, biodiversity and functional traits are important factors that have to be considered.","[Migliavacca, Mirco; Perez-Priego, Oscar; El-Madany, Tarek S.; Berninger, Anna; Bessenbacher, Verena; Guan, Jin-Hong; Hammer, Tiana W.; Henkel, Kathrin; Kolle, Olaf; Musavi, Talie; Wutzler, Thomas; Zaehle, Soenke; Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Rossini, Micol; Julitta, Tommaso] Univ Milano Bicocca, Piazza Sci 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Moreno, Gerardo; Juarez-Alcalde, Enrique; Perez-Burgueno, Andrea] Univ Extremadura, INDEHESA Forest Res Grp, Plasencia 10600, Spain; [van der Tol, Christiaan] Univ Twente, Dept Water Resources, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Rascher, Uwe; Burkart, Andreas] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Bio & Geosci IBG 2 Plant Sci, Leo Brandt Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Carrara, Arnaud] Fdn Ctr Estudios Ambient Mediterraneo CEAM, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Fava, Francesco] Int Livestock Res Inst, Naivasha Rd, Nairobi 30709, Kenya; [Guan, Jin-Hong] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, Peoples R China; [Pilar Martin, M.; Pacheco-Labrador, Javier] CSIC, Environm Remote Sensing & Spect Lab SpecLab, IEGD, Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain","Max Planck Society; University of Milano-Bicocca; Universidad de Extremadura; University of Twente; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Northwest A&F University - China; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Economia, Geografia y Demografia (IEGD)","Migliavacca, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",mmiglia@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Moreno, Gerardo/K-7825-2012; Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Zaehle, Sönke/C-9528-2017; Migliavacca, Mirco/J-9986-2019; El-Madany, Tarek S./AAO-6528-2020; Carrara, Arnaud/ABH-5319-2020; Rascher, Uwe/D-5457-2009; Martíin, Pilar/AAB-2782-2019; van der Tol, Christiaan/A-2403-2010","Moreno, Gerardo/0000-0001-8053-2696; Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Zaehle, Sönke/0000-0001-5602-7956; Migliavacca, Mirco/0000-0003-3546-8407; El-Madany, Tarek S./0000-0002-0726-7141; Carrara, Arnaud/0000-0002-9095-8807; Rascher, Uwe/0000-0002-9993-4588; Martíin, Pilar/0000-0002-5563-8461; Rossini, Micol/0000-0002-6052-3140; van der Tol, Christiaan/0000-0002-2484-8191; Juarez, Enrique/0000-0002-8713-8912; Julitta, tommaso/0000-0002-3870-2572; Perez-Priego, Oscar/0000-0002-3138-3177; Fava, Francesco Pietro/0000-0003-3748-7417",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Majadas de Tietar city council,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Majadas de Tietar city council,"The authors acknowledge the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for supporting this research with the Max-Planck Prize to Markus Reichstein, and the EUFAR TA project DEHESHyrE (EU FP7 Program).

Here we investigated the effects of climate warming and nitrogen addition on plant functional traits, plant hormone ethylene and net primary production in a 13-year field experiment in a desert steppe. Across the last 3 years of the experiment (2016-2018), plant productivity increased under warming only in 2016, when there was above normal precipitation, but consistently increased with nitrogen addition. Warming enhanced net photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen and ethylene production and reduced leaf lifespan in 2016 (a wet year), but not in 2017 (a drought year); the effect of warming in 2018 (a year with normal precipitation) was opposite to 2016, likely due to the below-normal precipitation in the mid-growing season in 2018. Nitrogen addition led to increases in leaf nitrogen, ethylene production and net photosynthesis, and declines in leaf lifespan in 2016 and 2018, but not in 2017. The ethylene-regulated lifespan was further evidenced by the addition of CoCl2 (an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor) that reduced ethylene production and prolonged lifespan. Structural equation modeling showed that leaf lifespan had a negative effect on plant productivity, both directly and indirectly via its negative effect on net photosynthesis, across all 3 years. Our results demonstrate the divergent responses of leaf lifespan and, in turn, plant productivity to warming under inter-annual and intra-annual precipitation variation, thus linking plant hormone production, functional traits and ecosystem functioning in the face of global environmental change.","[Ren, Haiyan; Han, Guodong; Gao, Cuiping] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Management & Uti, Key Lab Forage Cultivat Proc & High Efficient Uti, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm,Key Lab Grass, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China; [Ren, Haiyan; Jiang, Lin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Li, Mai-He] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Forest Dynam, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Li, Mai-He] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Changchun, Peoples R China","Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Northeast Normal University - China","Han, GD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Inner Mongolia Key Lab Grassland Management & Uti, Key Lab Forage Cultivat Proc & High Efficient Uti, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm,Key Lab Grass, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China.;Jiang, L (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",hanguodong@imau.edu.cn; lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Ren, Haiyan/I-1863-2019; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Ren, Haiyan/0000-0002-2008-9626; Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760146]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [171018]; Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents by Inner Mongolia Agricultural University [NDGCC2016-19]; Local science and technology development fund guided by the Central Government [2020ZY0008]; CAS Light of West China Program; Innovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China [IRT_17R59]; China Scholarship Council [201908150024]; US National Science Foundation [DEB-1856318, CBET-1833988]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); Scientific Research Foundation for Advanced Talents by Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Local science and technology development fund guided by the Central Government; CAS Light of West China Program; Innovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the Siziwang Grassland Research Station for access to the study site.

Nitrogen deposition is declining or is projected to decline in many regions due to the reduction of N-compound emissions. It remains unknown whether the cessation of N deposition will have legacy effects on plant nutrient stoichiometry. If there are stoichiometric legacy effects at the community-level from prior N enrichment, the contribution of changes in community composition relative to the stoichiometric responses of individual functional groups in driving these changes is unknown. Methods We measured plant N:P ratio at both functional group level and community level in a temperate steppe in three consecutive years following cessation of a 7-year N addition experiment with a wide-range of total amount added N in which the total amount of N added ranged from 0 to 350 g m(-2). Results The total amount of N addition was positively correlated with tall rhizomatous grass productivity and negatively correlated with tall bunchgrass productivity. Plant N:P ratios at both functional group and community levels did not change across N addition gradient. Community composition shifts contributed less than intra-group variation to the total variation of community level nutrient status in response to historic N addition. Conclusions Our results indicated that biological N:P imbalance in response to N deposition can be rapidly ameliorated after the cessation of N deposition. Such legacy effects of N deposition on plant nutrient status are largely driven by the changes of nutrient status of individual plants instead of N-induced shifts in community composition.","[Hu, Yan-Yu; Wei, Hai-Wei; Zhang, Zhi-Wei; Hou, Shuang-Li; Wang, Zheng-Wen; Lu, Xiao-Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yan-Yu; Wei, Hai-Wei; Zhang, Zhi-Wei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sistla, Seeta] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Nat Resources Management & Environm Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Yang, Jun-Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun-Feng] Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Vegetat Ecol, Minist Educ, Inst Grassland Sci, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Northeast Normal University - China","Lu, XT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",lvxiaotao@iae.ac.cn,"Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008","Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; Yang, Junjie/0000-0002-2946-0428",,,,NA,59,10,11,20,128,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2020,446,1-fev.,,NA,,NA,503,513,,10.1007/s11104-019-04357-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04357-7,NA,,11,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,KI8GJ,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000511594900032,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrofaunal communities were artificially assembled to manipulate both species richness and functional trait richness. In addition, naturally occurring communities were sampled in order to determine the effect of macrofaunal and sediment disruption. Ecosystem functioning was assessed by measurement of nutrient release (NH4-N) from the sediment, a process essential for primary production. Natural and assembled communities were found to differ significantly, demonstrating the effect of experimental manipulation on the system. Flow was found to have a highly significant effect on ecosystem functioning in both natural and assembled communities in treatments containing macrofauna. No significant difference between static and flow treatments was found in macrofaunal-free controls, indicating that flow generates an effect through promoting changes in bioturbatory activity of the infauna causing greater disruption to the sediment. In assembled communities, functional richness significantly increased ecosystem functioning. Species richness had no influence in assembled communities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To date, research has focused primarily on the effects of VSC on ecological patterns and processes, but comparatively little is known about what drives variation in VSC. Recent advances in active remote sensing technology, particularly light detection and ranging and radio detection and ranging, have allowed the measurement of VSC at unprecedented spatial scales and resolutions. Out of this and earlier work has emerged evidence that VSC is typically associated with greater ecosystem functioning (especially microclimate regulation, productivity, faunal diversity and habitat provisioning), making restoration of vegetation complexity a potentially powerful restoration tool. Recent studies of VSC across natural and experimental gradients of plant diversity have also revealed that more diverse plant communities tend to be more structurally complex. However, the shape and generality of this relationship-and the mechanism(s) by which phytodiversity might contribute to structural complexity-remain poorly understood. Here, we review how active remote sensing has facilitated recent VSC research and shaped our understanding of the relationship between vegetation complexity and ecosystem function. We then present a theoretical framework for the relationship between phytodiversity and VSC based on classic biodiversity-ecosystem functioning principles. Finally, we evaluate the evidence for the notion that diverse plant assemblages tend to be more structurally complex and explore the shape of the relationship between phytodiversity and VSC using data from 13 recent remote sensing studies. Synthesis. The relationship between phytodiversity and VSC appears to be almost universally positive. Preliminary evidence further suggests that the most common relationships between phytodiversity and VSC are linear or saturating, indicating that the extent of functional redundancy between species varies across plant communities and ecosystems. In contrast, we find little evidence for exponential or negative relationships between plant diversity and VSC, suggesting that even modest increases in plant diversity could markedly increase structural complexity. Additional investigations of phytodiversity-VSC relationships are necessary to establish whether the observed positive relationships are causal (and, if so, in which direction) and to clarify the potential impact of plant community restoration on structural complexity and broader ecosystem function.","[Coverdale, Tyler C.; Davies, Andrew B.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Coverdale, Tyler C.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Harvard University; University of Notre Dame,"Coverdale, TC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Coverdale, TC (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",tyler_coverdale@nd.edu,,"Davies, Andrew/0000-0002-0003-1435",,,,NA,146,0,0,37,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, few studies have moved beyond measuring biodiversity as species richness of a single group and/or focusing on a single ecosystem function. While there is a growing recognition that along environmental gradients, the compositional turnover of multiple trophic groups influences not only productivity but multiple ecosystem functions, we do not know yet which components of multi-trophic beta-diversity influence which ecosystem functions. Here, we captured the biodiversity found in soils using environmental DNA to study total soil multi-trophic beta-diversity (between all taxa regardless of their trophic group association), horizontal beta-diversities (beta-diversities within trophic groups) and vertical beta-diversity (beta-diversity across trophic groups) along a 1,000 m elevational gradient in the French Alps. Using path analyses, we quantified how these beta-diversity components mediate the effects of environmental turnover on the turnover of multiple ecosystem functions (i.e. productivity, N-cycling, N-leaching) and overall multifunctionality. While we found a strong direct effect of soil properties on the turnover of multiple ecosystem functions, we also found an indirect effect of climate and soil properties through multi-trophic beta-diversity. More specifically, only total multi-trophic beta-diversity and the horizontal beta-diversity of saprophytic fungi were strongly related to the turnover of multifunctionality and, to a lower extent, the turnover of productivity and N-cycling. Our results suggest that decomposition processes and resulting nutrient availability are key to understand how ecosystem functions change along soil properties and climatic gradients in alpine ecosystems. By demonstrating how saprophytic fungi and their associated trophic groups can offset the direct responses of multiple ecosystem functions to environmental change, our study highlights the paramount importance of multi-trophic diversity for better understanding ecosystem multifunctionality in a changing world.

Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem function and is affected by N enrichment either by a change in litter quality (the recalcitrance of the plant material) or through a change in soil quality (the abiotic and biotic components of the soil that affect decomposition). How the direct and indirect effects of N alter soil and litter quality remains poorly known. We designed a large grassland field experiment manipulating N enrichment, plant species richness and functional composition in a full factorial design. We used three complementary litterbag experiments, combined in a structural equation model (SEM), to quantify the effects of the treatments and various measures of functional composition and diversity on litter and soil quality and overall decomposition. Our results revealed multiple drivers of litter quality and showed that nutrient concentrations (N and calcium) were about twice as important as structural components (leaf dry matter content, fibres) in determining litter quality. Overall the experimental results suggest that N enrichment increases litter decomposition mostly indirectly through a shift in functional composition toward faster growing plant species, producing higher quality litter. N enrichment also altered soil quality and thereby litter decomposition, through its effects on vegetation cover. Our approach provides a mechanistic tool to test the drivers of litter decomposition across different ecosystems. Our results show that litter quality is determined by several nutrient and structure traits and highlight the importance of considering shifts in plant species composition when assessing the effects of N enrichment on decomposition.","[Pichon, Noemie A.; Cappelli, Seraina L.; Allan, Eric] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Soliveres, Santiago] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain; [Soliveres, Santiago] Univ Alicante, Multidisciplinary Inst Environm Studies Ramon Mar, Alicante, Spain; [Hoelzel, Norbert] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Munster, Germany; [Klaus, Valentin H.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kleinebecker, Till] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Inst Landscape Ecol & Resource Management, Giessen, Germany",University of Bern; Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant; University of Munster; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Pichon, NA (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland.",noemie.pichon@ips.unibe.ch,"Klaus, Valentin H./HKM-8112-2023; Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/AAP-3415-2020; Codina, Santiago Soliveres/A-2291-2016; Pichon, Noémie A./AAP-3412-2020; Allan, Eric/AAR-9566-2020","Klaus, Valentin H./0000-0002-7469-6800; Cappelli, Seraina Lisa/0000-0002-8141-404X; Codina, Santiago Soliveres/0000-0001-9661-7192; Pichon, Noémie A./0000-0003-2972-1912; Allan, Eric/0000-0001-9641-9436","Ramon y Cajal, Spain [RYC-2016-20604]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [160212]","Ramon y Cajal, Spain(Spanish Government); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","Ramon y Cajal, Spain, Grant/Award Number: RYC-2016-20604; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 160212",NA,63,23,24,15,121,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The method does not require prior taxonomic information and integrates variation in plant functional traits between and within plant species. We compare our method with leaf-level field measurements and species-level plot inventory data and find reasonable agreement. Morphological and physiological diversity show consistent change with topography and soil, with low functional richness at a mountain ridge under specific environmental conditions. Overall, functional richness follows a logarithmic increase with area, whereas divergence and evenness are scale invariant.

Yet, we know little about the decoupled or coupled relationship between plant and soil microbial diversity, involving plant-soil feedback and confounding effects of environmental factors, synergistically maintaining biodiversity and function in mosaic communities. Here, we measured plant and soil microbial diversity in mosaic plots dominated by different plant functional groups (i.e., typical, sedges-, grasses-, legumes- or forbs-dominated communities) in the same Tibetan alpine meadow. We examined the difference in plant and soil microbial diversity between distinct communities using generalized linear models and assessed the relationships between plants, soil microbes, and edaphic factors using canonical discriminant analysis and generalized partial regression. Compared to the typical community: i) plant diversity increased and decreased in forbs- and sedges-dominated plots, respectively; ii) soil bacterial diversity increased in plots dominated by sedges and grasses; and iii) soil fungal diversity increased in plots dominated by sedges and legumes. The increase in soil bacterial diversity is associated with increasing standing biomass, plant diversity and soil available phosphorus but decreasing soil pH and soil available nitrogen, accounting for 52-66% of the variation. Despite being less pronounced, soil fungal diversity was positively associated with plant diversity and soil available phosphorus but tended to be negatively associated with standing biomass. In short, the results revealed that under complex interaction of soil-plant-microbes, the biodiversity of soil microbes is strongly coupled with plant functional groups relating to the availability of soil phosphorus, maintaining ecosystem function and service in soil phosphorus-limited mosaic meadows.","[Liu, Zekun; Bayaerta, Kechang; Niu, Kechang] Yili Normal Univ, Coll Biol & Geog Sci, Yining 835000, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie; Niu, Kechang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China",Yili Normal University; Nanjing University,"Bayaerta; Niu, KC (corresponding author), Yili Normal Univ, Coll Biol & Geog Sci, Yining 835000, Peoples R China.;Niu, KC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",bayaerta@126.com; kechangniu@nju.edu.cn,"Niu, Kechang/F-7648-2014","Niu, Kechang/0000-0003-4845-2930",Yili Normal University Research Project [2017YSYY01]; National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [32171519],Yili Normal University Research Project; National Natural Science Founda-tion of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Funding This study was supported by the Yili Normal University Research Project [No. 2017YSYY01] ; and the National Natural Science Founda-tion of China [No. 32171519] .,NA,64,0,0,10,10,ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER,ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX,"65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE",1164-5563,1778-3615,,EUR J SOIL BIOL,Eur.

Direct and indirect trophic and non-trophic processes could well be acting simultaneously within the same food web, and their overall effects may even interact with each other. We studied indirect interactions in a relatively simple trophic system comprising a single producer, two herbivores and a guild of predators. In particular, we assessed whether (i) the principal herbivore fish, Sarpa salpa, is capable of modifying a seagrass trait, canopy height, by grazing and (ii) whether grazing-induced habitat alteration can trigger an environment-mediated modification of the interaction between herbivorous sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus and their predators. We tested these hypotheses with field experiments including fish herbivore-exclusion experiments (to examine the ability of S.salpa to modify seagrass habitats) and predation experiments using tethered sea urchins in a meadow with varying canopy heights (to test whether habitat modification can mediate urchin predation risk). The effect of S.salpa herbivory was highly significant. Canopy height in herbivore-excluded plots was more than 3.5 times higher than in uncaged control plots. In addition, adult sea urchin predation risk in the most highly grazed plots was 45 times higher than plots with higher canopy heights. In contrast, predation risk on juvenile urchins was not influenced by canopy height. Our results show that predation pressure on a key herbivore can be modified both by the environmental context within which it finds itself and by the actions of another herbivore that modifies the plant traits that create this environmental context. These act as two discrete pathways that interact in potentially nonlinear ways, mediating top-down control in these ecosystems. Herbivores, particularly when acting as ecosystem engineers, may have the potential to mediate and increase predation risk, as they substantially modify habitat structure, with consequences for refuge availability, among others. Assessing these indirect interactions is not just important to understand the functioning of the system itself but may have important management and conservation consequences.","[Pages, Jordi F.; Farina, Simone; Gera, Alessandro; Alcoverro, Teresa] Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes CEAB CSIC, Blanes 17300, Catalonia, Spain; [Arthur, Rohan] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India; [Romero, Javier] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol, E-08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); University of Barcelona,"Pages, JF (corresponding author), Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes CEAB CSIC, Acces Cala St Francesc 14, Blanes 17300, Catalonia, Spain.",jpages@ceab.csic.es,"Romero, Javier/A-8905-2013; Pagès, Jordi F/E-7107-2013; Alcoverro, Teresa/J-9258-2012; Farina, Simone/ABF-4876-2021","Romero, Javier/0000-0002-2772-8486; Pagès, Jordi F/0000-0001-9346-8312; Alcoverro, Teresa/0000-0002-3910-9594; Farina, Simone/0000-0003-0169-8044; Arthur, Rohan/0000-0003-4267-9720","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CTM2010-22273-C02-01, 02]; Spanish Ministry of Education [AP2008-01601]; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) [JAEPre_08_00466]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC)","We are very grateful to Guillem Roca, Jordi Boada and Scott Bennett for field assistance.

Here we examined how different fertilization regimes affected the energy flux across multitrophic levels of soil nematodes in the paddy rice and upland maize fields. We considered 13 ecosystem functions of four ecological processes related to plant productivity, nutrient cycling processes and drivers, and functional stability, which are central to energy and nutrient flow across trophic levels. To confirm whether multitrophic flux would underpin the relationships between biodiversity and multifunctionality, we compared energy flux with other approaches including taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and community composition. Results showed that organic fertilizer supported 33-340% greater multitrophic energy flux of soil nematode community and enhanced 41-264% of ecosystem multifunctionality in both fields compared with mineral fertilizer treatments. Organic fertilization enhanced ecosystem multi functionality by favoring energy flux in multitrophic levels of soil nematodes, while fertilization-mediated changes in other facets of biodiversity were less related to multifunctionality. Our study provides empirical evidence that energy flux within food webs can be used to understand the impacts of environmental change drivers on ecosystem multifunctionality.","[Wan, Bingbing; Liu, Ting; Gong, Xin; Zhang, Yu; Li, Chongjun; Chen, Xiaoyun; Hu, Feng; Liu, Manqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Soil Ecol Lab, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Wan, Bingbing; Liu, Ting; Gong, Xin; Zhang, Yu; Li, Chongjun; Chen, Xiaoyun; Hu, Feng; Liu, Manqiang] Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Solid Organ Waste R, Key Lab Biol Interact & Crop Hlth, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China; [Griffiths, Bryan S.] Dept Agr, SRUC, Hort & Engn Sci, Edinburgh, Scotland",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Chen, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Soil Ecol Lab, Nanjing 210095, Peoples R China.",xychen@njau.edu.cn,"Hu, Feng/IAN-4009-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877056, 32171640]; National Key RD program [2021YFD1700202]; Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China [2018-FY100300]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key RD program; Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China,"Acknowledgments This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877056, 32171640) , National Key R&D program (2021YFD1700202) , and Fundamental Resources Investigation Program of China (2018-FY100300) .

These strategies can be equally successful in the maintenance of a favourable water balance, allowing species persistence and co-occurrence. Distinct strategies to deal with drought permitted wide divergence regarding embolism vulnerability. Our findings highlight the importance of looking beyond embolism resistance metrics in mega-diverse vegetations to access plant adherence to climate but also drought vulnerability. Amazonian savannas are isolated patches of open habitats found within the extensive matrix of Amazonian tropical forests. There remains limited evidence on how Amazonian plants from savannas differ in the traits related to drought resistance and water loss control. Previous studies have reported several xeromorphic characteristics of Amazonian savanna plants at the leaf and branch levels that are linked to soil, solar radiation, rainfall and seasonality. How anatomical features relate to plant hydraulic functioning in this ecosystem is less known and instrumental if we want to accurately model transitions in trait states between alternative vegetation in Amazonia. In this context, we combined studies of anatomical and hydraulic traits to understand the structure-function relationships of leaf and wood xylem in plants of Amazonian savannas. We measured 22 leaf, wood and hydraulic traits, including embolism resistance (as P-50), Hydraulic Safety Margin (HSM) and isotope-based water use efficiency (WUE), for the seven woody species that account for 75% of the biomass of a typical Amazonian savanna on rocky outcrops in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Few anatomical traits are related to hydraulic traits. Our findings showed wide variation exists among the seven species studied here in resistance to embolism, water use efficiency and structural anatomy, suggesting no unique dominant functional plant strategy to occupy an Amazonian savanna. We found wide variation in resistance to embolism (-1.6 +/- 0.1 MPa and -5.0 +/- 0.5 MPa) with species that are less efficient in water use (e.g. Kielmeyera rubriflora, Macairea radula, Simarouba versicolor, Parkia cachimboensis and Maprounea guianensis) showing higher stomatal conductance potential, supporting xylem functioning with leaf succulence and/or safer wood anatomical structures and that species that are more efficient in water use (e.g. Norantea guianensis and Alchornea discolor) can exhibit riskier hydraulic strategies. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how branch and leaf structural traits combine to allow for different hydraulic strategies among coexisting plants. In Amazonian savannas, this may mean investing in buffering water loss (e.g. succulence) at leaf level or safer structures (e.g. thicker pit membranes) and architectures (e.g. vessel grouping) in their branch xylem.","[Simioni, Priscila F.; Setime, Lara; Pireda, Saulo; Da Cunha, Maura] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Biol Celular & Tecidual, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil; [Emilio, Thaise] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Programa Nacl Pos Doutorado PNPD, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Campinas, Brazil; [Giles, Andre L.] Instituo Nacl Pesquisa Amazonia INPA, Manaus, AM, Brazil; [Giles, Andre L.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Agr, Dept Fitotecnia, Florianopolis, Brazil; [de Freitas, Gustavo Viana; Vitoria, Angela Pierre] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil; [Oliveira, Rafael Silva] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Campinas, Brazil; [da Silva, Ivone Vieira] Univ Estado Mato Grosso, Lab Biol Vegetal, Alta Floresta, MT, Brazil",Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso,"Simioni, PF (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Biol Celular & Tecidual, Campos Dos Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil.",priscila-simioni@hotmail.com,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ); CNPq scholarship; UNICAMP postgraduate program in Ecology; Brazilian Higher Education Co-ordination Agency (CAPES); CNPq Sinbiose process [442371-2019-5],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); CNPq scholarship(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); UNICAMP postgraduate program in Ecology; Brazilian Higher Education Co-ordination Agency (CAPES); CNPq Sinbiose process,This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq); and Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ).

It is assumed that flower traits explain these effects, but it is still unclear which flower traits are responsible, and knowing that, if pollinator richness and visitation frequency are more driven by mass-ratio effects (mean trait values) or by trait diversity. Here, we analyse a three-year data set of pollinator observations collected in a European grassland plant diversity experiment (The Jena experiment). The data entail comprehensive flower trait measurements, including reward traits (nectar and pollen amount), morphological traits (height, symmetry, area, colour spectra) and chemical traits (nectar-amino acid and nectar-sugar concentration). We test if pollinator species richness and visitation frequency of flower communities depend on overall functional diversity combining all flower traits within a community, single trait diversities (within trait variation) and community-weighted means of the single traits, using Bayesian inference. Overall functional diversity did not affect pollinator species richness, but reduced visitation frequency. When looking at individual flower traits separately, we found that single trait diversity of flower reflectance and flower morphology were important predictors of pollinator visitation frequency. Moreover, independent of total flower abundance, community-weighted means of flower height, area, reflectance, nectar-sugar concentration and nectar-amino acid concentration strongly affected both pollinator species richness and visitation frequency. Our results, challenge the idea that functional diversity always positively affects ecosystem functions. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that both single trait diversity and mass-ratio effects of flower traits play an important role for diverse and frequent flower visits, which underlines the functionality of flower traits for pollination services.","[Fornoff, Felix; Klein, Alexandra-Maria] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Germany; [Hartig, Florian] Univ Regensburg, Theoret Ecol, Fac Biol & Preclin Med, Regensburg, Germany; [Hartig, Florian; Benadi, Gita] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Germany; [Venjakob, Christine] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Ecosyst Funct, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [Schaefer, H.

However, the role of plant economic strategies in the effects of living root activity on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics through rhizodeposition remains unexplored, despite SOC being the largest terrestrial carbon pool. Using a continuous C-13-labelling method allowing partitioning of plant and soil sources to carbon fluxes and pools, we studied here the linkages between plant economic strategies and SOC cycling processes in a 'common garden' greenhouse experiment. It includes a panel of 12 grassland species selected along a gradient of economic traits and belonging to three functionnal groups (C3 grasses, forbs and legumes). All species induced an acceleration of native SOC mineralization but this rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) substantially differed across species and varied eleven-fold by the end of the experiment (from +26% to +295% relative to unplanted soil). Interspecific variation in RPE was primarily linked to plant photosynthetic activity associated to species economic strategies of light and CO2 resource acquisition and processing. Fast-growing acquisitive species, such as legumes, featured large RPE, in relation with their high canopy photosynthesis coupled to high leaf photosynthetic capacity and large net primary productivity allocated above-ground. This large RPE was further associated with high root metabolic activity, rhizodeposition and soil microbial activity. In contrast, fine-root growth and economic traits related to soil resource foraging ability were poor predictors of RPE. The formation of new root-derived SOC varied nine-fold across species and was similarly positively related to the net primary productivity allocated above-ground. Fast-growing acquisitive species with a high photosynthetic activity induced a disproportionately large RPE relative to SOC formation. Synthesis. Overall, our study demonstrates that rhizodeposition is a major mechanism through which plant economic strategies of grassland species control soil carbon dynamics. Acquisitive versus conservative species were associated with high versus low rates of photosynthesis and rhizodeposition, in turn leading to fast versus slow SOC turnover. This emphasizes the importance of considering rhizosphere processes for understanding plant species effects on soil biogeochemistry.","[Henneron, Ludovic; Cros, Camille; Picon-Cochard, Catherine; Rahimian, Vida; Fontaine, Sebastien] INRA, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Henneron, Ludovic] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden",INRAE; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Henneron, L (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Ecosyst Prairial, Clermont Ferrand, France.;Henneron, L (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden.",ludovic_henneron@hotmail.com,,"Henneron, Ludovic/0000-0002-3979-0543","French National Research Agency [ANR 14-CE01-0004, ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]",French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"French National Research Agency, Grant/Award Number: ANR 14-CE01-0004 and ANR-11-LABX-0002-01",NA,94,59,60,35,283,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, the resilience of ecosystems depends not only on species richness but also on the functions (responses and effects) of species within communities and ecosystems. Therefore, a functional approach is required to estimate functional diversity through functional traits and to model its changes in space and time. This study aims to: (i) assess the accuracy of estimates of species richness and tree functional richness obtained from field data and Sentinel-2 imagery in tropical dry forests of the Yucatan Peninsula; (ii) map and analyze the relationships between these two variables. We calculated species richness and functional richness (from six functional traits) of trees from 87 plots of the National Forest Inventory in a semi-deciduous tropical forest and 107 in a semi-evergreen tropical forest. Species richness and functional richness were mapped using reflectance values, vegetation indices, and texture measurements from Sentinel-2 imagery as explanatory variables. Validation of the models to map these two variables yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.43 and 0.50, and a mean squared relative error of 25.4% and 48.8%, for tree species richness and functional richness, respectively. For both response variables, the most important explanatory variables were Sentinel-2 texture measurements and spectral bands. Tree species richness and functional richness were positively correlated in both forest types. Bivariate maps showed that 44.9% and 26.5% of the forests studied had high species richness and functional richness values. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating field data and remotely sensed variables for estimating tree species richness and functional richness. In addition, the combination of species richness and functional richness maps presented here is potentially valuable for planning, conservation, and restoration strategies by identifying areas that maximize ecosystem service provisioning, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation.","[Alexis Pena-Lara, Victor; Manuel Dupuy, Juan; Reyes-Garcia, Casandra; Luis Hernandez-Stefanoni, Jose] Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan AC, Unidad Recursos Nat, Calle 43 130, Merida 97200, Yucatan, Mexico; [Sanaphre-Villanueva, Lucia] Consejo Nacl Ciencia & Technol, Ctr Cambio Global & La Sustentabilidad AC, Calle Centenario Inst Juarez S-N Col Reforma, Villahermosa 86080, Tabasco, Mexico; [Portillo-Quintero, Carlos A.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Geospatial Technol Lab, Box 42125, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Cient Yucatan AC, Unidad Recursos Nat, Calle 43 130, Merida 97200, Yucatan, Mexico.",jl_stefanoni@cicy.mx,"Hernandez-Stefanoni, J Luis/B-3958-2008","Sanaphre Villanueva, Lucia/0000-0001-5566-7230; Hernandez-Stefanoni, Jose Luis/0000-0002-9559-7131; Pena Lara, Victor Alexis/0000-0002-5279-4303; Dupuy, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-7491-6837",,,,NA,63,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2022,14,23,,NA,,NA,,,5919,10.3390/rs14235919,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14235919,NA,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,6X3MU,NA,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000896322000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remote sensing is a vital way to monitor the status and changes of PD. Most of the existing methods rely on a field botany survey to construct a statistical relationship between PD and remote sensing observations. However, a field botany survey is too costly to be applied widely. In this study, we constructed a new remote sensing index of PD (RSPD), combining the spectral variation hypothesis and productivity hypothesis. Concretely, the RSPD integrated the multi-band spectral reflectance and several spectral greenness, moisture, and red-edge vegetation indices with the principles of Shannon information entropy and Euclidean distance. The RSPD was evaluated by comparing the classical coefficient of variation (CV) method and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices based on vegetation classification results. Two cases were selected, where Case I was in Beijing and Case II was located in part of Huai'an, China. Sentinel-2 data in three years of 2016, 2018, and 2020 and higher-resolution Pleiades-1 data in 2018 were also utilized. The results demonstrate that: (1) the RSPD is basically consistent with the CV in spatiotemporal variation; (2) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with Shannon and Simpson diversity indices that are based on vegetation classification results with Sentinel-2 and Pleiades-1 data; (3) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with visual interpretations with Google Earth image.

Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons across studies and integration of information across databases by providing standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical, but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.","[Freschet, Gregoire T.; Roumet, Catherine; Garnier, Eric; Weemstra, Monique] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CNRS, CEFE,IRD, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Freschet, Gregoire T.; Rose, Laura] CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, 2 Route CNRS, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Pages, Loic] INRAE, Ctr PACA, UR 1115 PSH, Site Agroparc, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Iversen, Colleen M.; Salmon, Verity] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Iversen, Colleen M.; Salmon, Verity] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Comas, Louise H.] USDA ARS, Water Management Res Unit, 2150 Ctr Ave,Bldg,Suite 320, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Rewald, Boris] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Klimesova, Jitka] CAS, Dept Funct Ecol, Inst Bot, Trebon 37901, Czech Republic; [Zadworny, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Poorter, Hendrik; Postma, Johannes A.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Plant Sci IBG 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Poorter, Hendrik] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Adams, Thomas S.] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bagniewska-Zadworna, Agnieszka] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Inst Expt Biol, Dept Gen Bot, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Bengough, A.

Eighteen representative studies drawn from post-1999 literature specifically examined how changes in biodiversity affect benthic ecosystem processes. Results from these small-scale, low-diversity manipulative studies indicate that the effects of changes in biodiversity (mostly synonymous with local species richness) are highly variable over space and time and frequently depend on specific biological traits or functional roles of individual species. Future studies of freshwater and marine ecosystems will require the development of new experimental designs at larger spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, to successfully integrate field and laboratory studies, the derivation of realistic models and appropriate experiments will require approaches different from those already used in terrestrial systems.","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Lab Dynam Biodivers, F-31055 Toulouse, France; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, Sediment Ecol Res Grp, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; Univ Rennes 1, F-35042 Rennes, France; Univ Tours, Fac Sci, CNRS, UMR 6035,Inst Rech Biol Insecte, F-37200 Tours, France; Univ Aberdeen, Newburgh AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland; EAWAG, Dept Limnol, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Mount Allison University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of St Andrews; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Tours; University of Aberdeen; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; N8 Research Partnership; University of Liverpool,"Covich, AP (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",alanc@uga.edu,"Cardinale, Bradley J/I-7076-2013; Dangles, Olivier/C-4924-2009; Austen, Melanie C/GLU-1418-2022; Solan, Martin/E-9338-2012; Chauvet, Eric/F-7644-2011; Baerlocher, Felix/C-1307-2011","Dangles, Olivier/0000-0002-1987-8433; Austen, Melanie C/0000-0001-8133-0498; Solan, Martin/0000-0001-9924-5574; Chauvet, Eric/0000-0001-8676-392X; Baerlocher, Felix/0000-0003-2404-625X",,,,NA,69,240,251,8,174,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-3568,1525-3244,,BIOSCIENCE,Bioscience,AUG,2004,54,8,,NA,,NA,767,775,,10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0767:TROBIT]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0767:TROBIT]2.0.CO;2,NA,,9,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,844GM,NA,"Green Published, Bronze",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000223146000012,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, consequences of changes in forest biodiversity remain difficult to predict because of limited knowledge about how tree diversity influences ecosystem functions. Litter decomposition is a key process affecting nutrient cycling, productivity, and carbon storage and can be influenced by plant biodiversity. Leaf litter species composition, environmental conditions, and the detritivore community are main components of the decomposition process, but their complex interactions are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the effect of tree functional diversity (FD) on litter decomposition in a field experiment manipulating tree diversity and partitioned the effects of litter physiochemical diversity and the detritivore community. We used litterbags with different mesh sizes to separate the effects of microorganisms and microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna and monitored soil fauna using pitfall traps and earthworm extractions. We hypothesized that higher tree litter FD accelerates litter decomposition due to the availability of complementary food components and higher activity of detritivores. Although we did not find direct effects of tree FD on litter decomposition, we identified key litter traits and macrodetritivores that explained part of the process. Litter mass loss was found to decrease with an increase in leaf litter carbon:nitrogen ratio. Moreover, litter mass loss increased with an increasing density of epigeic earthworms, with most pronounced effects in litterbags with a smaller mesh size, indicating indirect effects. Higher litter FD and litter nutrient content were found to increase the density of surface-dwelling macrofauna and epigeic earthworm biomass. Based on structural equation modeling, we conclude that tree FD has a weak positive effect on soil surface litter decomposition by increasing the density of epigeic earthworms and that litter nitrogen-related traits play a central role in tree composition effects on soil fauna and decomposition.","[Patoine, Guillaume; Bruelheide, Helge; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Patoine, Guillaume; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Haase, Josephine; Nock, Charles; Ohlmann, Niklas; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Nock, Charles] Univ Alberta, Fac Agr Life & Environm Sci, Dept Renewable Resources, Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Schwarz, Benjamin] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Germany",Leipzig University; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Freiburg; University of Alberta; University of Freiburg,"Patoine, G (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",guillaume.patoine@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Patoine, Guillaume/AAS-5683-2020","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Patoine, Guillaume/0000-0002-3748-6644; Nock, Charles/0000-0002-3483-0390; Schwarz, Benjamin/0000-0002-0587-3113",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FZT 118]; H2020 European Research Council [677232],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FZT 118; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 677232",NA,105,9,10,17,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Assessing vegetation structures provides valuable direct and indirect information on biodiversity and ecosystem health, since plant communities govern terrestrial ecosystem functions and overall biodiversity. A growing body of literature supports the hypothesis that acoustic profiling and characterization of soundscapes may reveal natural patterns and ecosystem responses to environmental disturbances. Although assessments of ecosystem soundscapes are a promising tool for ecological monitoring, the influence of vegetation structure on acoustic indices remains largely unaddressed. An effective non-invasive approach to monitoring ecosystem health includes use of active acoustic transducers, which convert mechanical/acoustic energy into electrical energy and visa-versa. This article reviews and discusses possible applications (and also constraints) of active acoustic transducers in monitoring and assessments of terrestrial ecosystem health. Specifically, this article includes a brief introduction to the basic principles of sound and types of active acoustic transducers. Moreover, we provide reviews of common uses of active acoustic transducers in assessing plant structures and plant functional traits.

Invertebrates play a key role in determining soil sustainability and crop health. Many species of invertebrates are important in soil fertility and play a vital role in the production and maintenance of healthy soils. Soil fauna have several roles in the functioning of ecosystems: they influence plant productivity, regulate nutrient mineralization, allow decomposition and act as a buffer. The functional groups of invertebrates in relation to plants are reliable bioindicators, as they provide information on soil quality, ecological services and the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole. The conceptual approach of plant-soil interaction research has shifted from plant strategies to more quantitative approaches using plant-specific functional traits and soil food web characteristics. Because plants use nutrients in inorganic form, they depend on the rate of mineralization in the soil. It has often been assumed that nutrient mineralization is mainly the result of soil microflora activity. The appearance of soil fauna population increases the release of nutrients by fragmenting waste, grazing microflora.","[Chiriac, Luiza-Silvia; Murariu, Dumitru] Inst Biol Bucharest, 296 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania; [Chiriac, Luiza-Silvia; Murariu, Dumitru] Univ Bucharest, Fac Biol, 91-95 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania",Institute of Biology Bucharest; University of Bucharest,"Chiriac, LS (corresponding author), Inst Biol Bucharest, 296 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania.;Chiriac, LS (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Fac Biol, 91-95 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest, Romania.",luiza.chiriac@ibiol.ro,"Chiriac, Luiza Silvia/AAB-8495-2022","Chiriac, Luiza Silvia/0000-0001-7605-971X","Doctoral School of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest;  [RO1567-IBB01/2021];  [PN-III-CERC-CO-PED-2-2019]","Doctoral School of Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Bucharest; ; ","I would like to thank to my colleagues Dr. Onete Marilena and Dr. Manu Minodora for their guidance in carrying out this work.

However, there is a need for theory and integrated data collection to scale from traits to ecosystems. We assess predictions of a novel trait-based scaling theory, including whether observed shifts in forest traits across a broad tropical temperature gradient are consistent with local phenotypic optima and adaptive compensation for temperature. Location: An elevation gradient spanning 3,300 m and consisting of thousands of tropical tree trait measures taken from 16 1-ha tropical forest plots in southern Peru, where gross and net primary productivity (GPP and NPP) were measured. Time period: April to November 2013. Major taxa studied: Plants; tropical trees. Methods: We developed theory to scale from traits to communities and ecosystems and tested several predictions. We assessed the covariation between climate, traits, biomass and GPP and NPP. We measured multiple traits linked to variation in tree growth and assessed their frequency distributions within and across the elevation gradient. We paired these trait measures across individuals within 16 forests with simultaneous measures of ecosystem net and gross primary productivity. Results: Consistent with theory, variation in forest NPP and GPP primarily scaled with forest biomass, but the secondary effect of temperature on productivity was much less than expected. This weak temperature dependence appears to reflect directional shifts in several mean community traits that underlie tree growth with decreases in site temperature. Main conclusions: The observed shift in traits of trees that dominate in more cold environments is consistent with an 'adaptive/acclimatory' compensation for the kinetic effects of temperature on leaf photosynthesis and tree growth. Forest trait distributions across the gradient showed overly peaked and skewed distributions, consistent with the importance of local filtering of optimal growth traits and recent shifts in species composition and dominance attributable to warming from climate change. Trait-based scaling theory provides a basis to predict how shifts in climate have and will influence the trait composition and ecosystem functioning of tropical forests.","[Enquist, Brian J.; Maitner, Brian; Michaletz, Sean; Buzzard, Vanessa] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Enquist, Brian J.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Bentley, Lisa Patrick] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [Shenkin, Alexander; Blonder, Benjamin; Salinas, Norma; Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Savage, Van] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Michaletz, Sean] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Div, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Espinoza, Tatiana Erika Boza] Univ Zurich, Inst Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Zurich, Switzerland; [Farfan-Rios, William] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Farfan-Rios, William] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Secc Quim, Lima, Peru; [Doughty, Christopher E.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Goldsmith, Gregory R.] Paul Scherrer Inst, Ecosyst Fluxes Grp, Lab Atmospher Chem, Villigen, Switzerland; [Martin, Roberta E.; Asner, Gregory P.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, CONCIET, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, Cordoba, Argentina; [Diaz, Sandra] Univ Nacl Cordoba, FCEFyN, Cordoba, Argentina",University of Arizona; The Santa Fe Institute; California State University System; Sonoma State University; University of Oxford; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; University of Zurich; Wake Forest University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; Northern Arizona University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; Carnegie Institution for Science; National University of Cordoba; National University of Cordoba,"Enquist, BJ (autor correspondente), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",benquist@email.arizona.edu,"Salinas, Norma/K-8960-2015; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/AHC-5048-2022; Farfan-Rios, William/J-9881-2015; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Shenkin, Alexander/L-1653-2017; Enquist, Brian J/B-6436-2008; Diaz, Sandra/Q-9804-2018; Shenkin, Alexander/AAQ-4166-2021; Michaletz, Sean/AAO-8175-2021; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015","Salinas, Norma/0000-0001-9941-2109; Farfan-Rios, William/0000-0002-3196-0317; Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Shenkin, Alexander/0000-0003-2358-9367; Enquist, Brian J/0000-0002-6124-7096; Michaletz, Sean/0000-0003-2158-6525; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530; Boza Espinoza, Tatiana Erika/0000-0002-9925-1795; Maitner, Brian/0000-0002-2118-9880","U.K. NERC [NE/J023418/1, NE/M019160/1]; GEM-TRAITS [321131]; T-FORCES [291585]; John D. and Catherine T.

In water-limited regions, the size of annual plants is related to soil resource availability; therefore, inter-annual reorganization of annual plant communities is expressed through shifts in the diversity and weighted mean values of plant sizes. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of plastic changes at the individual plant level vs. community changes (species presence and abundance) as reorganization mechanisms on the one hand, and as shapers of ecosystem function on the other hand, is not known. We investigated reorganization through inter-annual changes in species diversity and functional structure (diversity and identity). Species richness, composition, and biomass were monitored over four years at Lehavim site, Israel, among adjacent topographic sites. All of the sampled plant individuals were divided into categories according to plant size. We calculated the inter-annual changes in productivity and examined the relationships between these changes and various reorganization indices. Reorganization indices based on both functional identity (value of size traits) and functional diversity of the community were strongly related to, and demonstrated similar predictive ability for, inter-annual changes in plant productivity. In contrast, reorganization indices based on community taxonomic structure demonstrated weaker relationships with changes in productivity. Different components of functional structure complemented each other during the reorganization process and their relative contributions to changes in productivity varied significantly among years. The level of expression of different reorganization mechanisms changes markedly among years and expresses the obstacles that limit the ability of the community to reorganize.","[Dovrat, Guy; Golodets, Carly] Ya'ar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, Newe, Agr Res Org, Box 1021, Ramat Yishay, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Bengur Univ, Dept Solar Energy, Environm Phys, Blaustein Institutes Desert Res, Sede Boqer Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Meron, Ehud] Bengur Univ, Phys Dept, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shachak, Moshe] Bengur Univ, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Blaustein Institutes Desert Res, Sede Boqer Campus, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Osem, Yagil] Dept Nat Resources, Agr Res Org, Volcani Ctr, Bet-dagan, Israel",Ben Gurion University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Dovrat, G (autor correspondente), Ya'ar Res Ctr, Dept Nat Resources, Newe, Agr Res Org, Box 1021, Ramat Yishay, Israel.",dovrat@volcani.agri.gov.il,"Meron, Ehud/F-1810-2012","Meron, Ehud/0000-0002-3602-7411",,,,NA,38,6,6,2,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,1573-5052,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,MAR,2020,221,3,,,,NA,191,204,,10.1007/s11258-020-01005-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-020-01005-4,NA,,14,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,KI8PE,NA,,NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000511619400004,View Full Record in Web of Science,Rayana,sim,NAO,sim,sim,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Precipitation is a primary climatic factor that regulates ecosystem function in arid regions. Based on remote sensing and meteorological data from 2000 to 2013, we analysed the spatiotemporal variations in annual net primary productivity (NPP) for different land cover types in the arid region of northern China and quantified the effects of growing season precipitation (GSP) and seasonal distribution of precipitation (SDP) on NPP variability by using the ecological process Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Our results suggested that significant NPP increases were found in most of the vegetated areas, especially in grasslands and shrublands. Responses of NPP to precipitation variability were related to land cover types. Grassland and shrubland were most responsive to precipitation variability followed by croplands and forests. Increased precipitation increased NPP, and NPP responded more strongly to higher precipitation than lower precipitation. We also found that increased precipitation concentration decreased NPP. GSP and SDP accounted for approximately 67% and 21%, respectively, of the variability in NPP. We concluded that growing season precipitation and its seasonal distribution were dominant factors controlling inter-annual variability in NPP in the arid region of northern China. Other factors, such as plant functional trait, antecedent soil moisture and human activities, might mediate NPP responses to precipitation variability through interaction with water availability. Our studies have implications for assessing and predicting vegetation responses to future climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we discuss the current status, challenges and prospects of functional concepts to plant litter diversity and microbial decomposer diversity. We also evaluate whether these concepts permit a better understanding of how biodiversity is linked to litter decomposition as a key ecosystem process influencing carbon and nutrient cycles. Based on a literature survey, we show that plant litter and microbial diversity matters for decomposition, but that considering numbers of taxonomic units appears overall as little relevant and less useful than functional diversity. However, despite easily available functional litter traits and the well-established theoretical framework for functional litter diversity, the impact of functional litter diversity on decomposition is not yet well enough explored. Defining functional diversity of microorganisms remains one of the biggest challenges for functional approaches to microbial diversity. Recent developments in microarray and metagenomics technology offer promising possibilities in the assessment of the functional structure of microbial communities. This might allow significant progress in measuring functional microbial diversity and ultimately in our ability to predict consequences of biodiversity loss in the decomposer system for biogeochemical processes.

The control that organism size exerts over physiological and ecological function suggests that allometry could be a powerful tool for scaling ecological processes across levels of organization. Here we use individual plant allometries to predict how nutrient content and productivity scale with total plant biomass (phytomass) in whole plant communities. As predicted by our model, net primary productivity as well as whole community nitrogen and phosphorus content all scale allometrically with phytomass across diverse plant communities, from tropical forest to arctic tundra. Importantly, productivity data deviate quantitatively from the theoretically derived prediction, and nutrient productivity (production per unit nutrient) of terrestrial plant communities decreases systematically with increasing total phytomass. These results are consistent with the existence of pronounced competitive size hierarchies.

There is however no consensus about how these traits are regulated, or how they should be modelled. Here we confirm that observed leaf nitrogen across species and sites can be estimated well from observed LMA and V-cmax at 25 degrees C (V-cmax25). We then test the hypothesis that global variations of both quantities depend on climate variables in specific ways that are predicted by leaf-level optimality theory, thus allowing both N-area to be predicted as functions of the growth environment. A new global compilation of field measurements was used to quantify the empirical relationships of leaf N to V-cmax25 and LMA. Relationships of observed V-cmax25 and LMA to climate variables were estimated, and compared to independent theoretical predictions of these relationships. Soil effects were assessed by analysing biases in the theoretical predictions. LMA was the most important predictor of N-area (increasing) and N-mass (decreasing). About 60% of global variation across species and sites in observed N-area, and 31% in N-mass, could be explained by observed LMA and V-cmax25. These traits, in turn, were quantitatively related to climate variables, with significant partial relationships similar or indistinguishable from those predicted by optimality theory. Predicted trait values explained 21% of global variation in observed site-mean V-cmax25, 43% in LMA and 31% in N-area. Predicted V-cmax25 was biased low on clay-rich soils but predicted LMA was biased high, with compensating effects on N-area. N-area was overpredicted on organic soils. Synthesis. Global patterns of variation in observed site-mean N-area can be explained by climate-induced variations in optimal V-cmax25 and LMA. Leaf nitrogen should accordingly be modelled as a consequence (not a cause) of V-cmax25 and LMA, both being optimized to the environment. Nitrogen limitation of plant growth would then be modelled principally via whole-plant carbon allocation, rather than via leaf-level traits. Further research is required to better understand and model the terrestrial nitrogen and carbon cycles and their coupling.","[Dong, Ning; Prentice, Iain Colin; Bloomfield, Keith J.] Imperial Coll London, Georgina Mace Ctr Living Planet, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England; [Dong, Ning; Prentice, Iain Colin; Wright, Ian J.; Poorter, Hendrik] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Prentice, Iain Colin; Wang, Han] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modelling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wright, Ian J.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Atkin, Owen K.] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Plant Energ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Domingues, Tomas F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Biol, FFCLRP, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Gleason, Sean M.] USDA ARS, Water Management & Syst Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO 80522 USA; [Maire, Vincent] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Dept Sci & Environm, Rois Rivieres, PQ, Canada; [Onoda, Yusuke] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, Japan; [Poorter, Hendrik] Forschungszentrum Julich, Plant Sci IBG, Julich, Germany; [Smith, Nicholas G.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Imperial College London; Macquarie University; Tsinghua University; Western Sydney University; Australian National University; Universidade de Sao Paulo; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; Kyoto University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Dong, N (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Georgina Mace Ctr Living Planet, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England.;Dong, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",n.dong@imperial.ac.uk,"Atkin, Owen K/C-8415-2009; Dong, Ning/HTP-7810-2023; Onoda, Yusuke/L-7179-2015; Wright, Ian/G-4979-2012","Atkin, Owen K/0000-0003-1041-5202; Onoda, Yusuke/0000-0001-6245-2342; Wright, Ian/0000-0001-8338-9143",Australian Research Council [DP170103410]; H2020 European Research Council [787203 REALM]; Schmidt Family Foundation; LEMONTREE,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)); Schmidt Family Foundation; LEMONTREE,"Australian Research Council, Grant/ Award Number: DP170103410; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 787203 REALM; Schmidt Family Foundation; LEMONTREE",NA,82,2,2,18,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Based on 14 years of data from the grazing experiment in S. breviflora desert steppe, we investigated changes in the individual tillering traits of S. breviflora in response to four levels (none, light, moderate, heavy) of long-term grazing. The results showed that: (i) long-term grazing resulted in a greater decrease in species richness and increased biomass contribution of S. breviflora in the communities; (ii) long-term grazing resulted in significant differences in aboveground/belowground plant tillering functional traits and their relationships under different grazing intensities; (iii) the leaf biomass of S. breviflora tillering individuals was strongly dependent on leaf number, while the change in root biomass was strongly dependent on the total root length, specific root length, root furcation number, and root crossing number. The response of S. breviflora biomass to grazing intensity and its relation to tillering individual traits revealed that long-term grazing leads to vast tillering in S. breviflora tussock and significant changes in S. breviflora tillering traits, which will have a profound influence on the function of the desert grassland ecosystem.","[Li, Jiangwen; Zhang, Xiaoxi; Li, Cai] Yanan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Chinese Jujube, Yanan 716000, Peoples R China; [Ha, Guodong; Kang, Saruul] Minist Educ China, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot 010020, Peoples R China","Yanan University; Ministry of Education, China","Li, JW (corresponding author), Yanan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Chinese Jujube, Yanan 716000, Peoples R China.",jiangwen-0105@163.com,"Kang, Saruul/HLQ-4192-2023; li, jiangwen/GZG-1808-2022","Kang, Saruul/0000-0003-4453-631X; ","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770500, 31760143]; Innovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China [IRT_17R59]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2021JQ-623]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Yan'an University [YDBK2019-18]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Yan'an University,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770500, 31760143), the Innovative Team of Grassland Resources from the Ministry of Education of China (IRT_17R59), the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2021JQ-623), and the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Yan'an University (YDBK2019-18).",NA,43,0,0,7,14,POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO BOTANICZNE,WARSAW,"AL UJAZDOWSKIE 4, 00-478 WARSAW, POLAND",0001-6977,2083-9480,,ACTA SOC BOT POL,Acta Soc.

Animals themselves are host-microbe ecosystems (holobionts), and the application of ecophysiological approaches can help to understand their functioning. In hard coral holobionts, communities of dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing prokaryotes (diazotrophs) may contribute a functional trait by providing bioavailable nitrogen (N) that could sustain coral productivity under oligotrophic conditions. This study quantified N-2 fixation by diazotrophs associated with four genera of hermatypic corals on a northern Red Sea fringing reef exposed to high seasonality. We found N-2 fixation activity to be 5- to 10-fold higher in summer, when inorganic nutrient concentrations were lowest and water temperature and light availability highest. Concurrently, coral gross primary productivity remained stable despite lower Symbiodinium densities and tissue chlorophyll a contents. In contrast, chlorophyll a content per Symbiodinium cell increased from spring to summer, suggesting that algal cells overcame limitation of N, an essential element for chlorophyll synthesis. In fact, N-2 fixation was positively correlated with coral productivity in summer, when its contribution was estimated to meet 11% of the Symbiodinium N requirements. These results provide evidence of an important functional role of diazotrophs in sustaining coral productivity when alternative external N sources are scarce.","[Cardini, Ulisse; Bednarz, Vanessa N.; Naumann, Malik S.; van Hoytema, Nanne; Rix, Laura; Wild, Christian] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, Coral Reef Ecol Grp CORE, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Foster, Rachel A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Al-Rshaidat, Mamoon M.

It is yet unclear how biodiversity and biomass are related in seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) communities where there is a seasonal water limitation. Aims The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of environmental filtering on ecosystem functioning, especially those related to biodiversity and above-ground biomass. Methods We estimated biomass and functional traits for all species in five plots at five sites in a SDTF. We related functional diversity and community-weighted trait mean (CWM) values to above-ground biomass (AGB) using linear mixed models. Results Functional diversity was not related to AGB, while CWM values of vessel density (VD) were positively and the Carlquist Vulnerability Index (CVI) was negatively related to AGB. Conclusion The CWM values of functional traits related to the trade-off between safety of water transport and the efficiency of water conductivity and conservative strategies (VD and CVI) were good predictors of AGB. The mass ratio hypothesis appears to be a better predictor of AGB than niche complementarity in our study conducted in the SDTF.","[Gianasi, Fernanda M.; Santos, Paola F.; dos Santos, Rubens M.] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Programme Appl Bot, Lavras, Brazil; [de Souza, Cleber R.; Maia, Vinicius A.; da Silva, Wilder B.; dos Santos, Rubens M.] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Forest Sci, Lavras, Brazil; [Fagundes, Nathalle C.

Through trait-based processes, plants in communities with high resident species diversity occupy a wider range of ecological niches and are more productive than low diversity communities, potentially reducing the opportunities for invasion through niche preemption. In terrestrial plant communities, biotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms can also affect invasibility by reducing leaf litter stocks and influencing soil conditions. In a greenhouse experiment, we simultaneously manipulated resident species diversity and earthworm presence to investigate independent and interactive effects of these two variables on the success of several invasive plants. Higher diversity of resident species was associated with lower biomass of invasives, with the effect mediated through resident species biomass. The presence of earthworms had a strong positive effect on the biomass of invasive species across all levels of resident species diversity and a weaker indirect negative effect via decreased soil moisture. Earthworms also weakened the positive correlation between resident species diversity and productivity. We did not observe any interactive effects of resident species biomass and earthworms on invasive species success. Partitioning the net biodiversity effect indicated that selection effects increased with resident species diversity whereas complementarity effects did not. Results suggest that managing for diverse forest communities may decrease the susceptibility of these communities to invasions. However, the presence of introduced earthworms in previously earthworm-free sites may undermine these efforts. Furthermore, future studies of plant community invasibility should account for the effects of introduced earthworms.","[Whitfeld, Timothy J.

Microbiome regulation of plant trait expression affects plant performance, which in turn influences various ecosystem functions, such as primary productivity and soil health. Understanding these plant-and microbe-driven interactions requires a study of the nature and effects of the plant microbiome. Conceptualizing the microbiome requires a synthesis of microbial ecology, physiology, and bioinformatics, integrated with insight into host biology and ecology. Microbiome structure and function analyses are recognized as essential components to understand the genetic and functional capacity of the host (previously assigned solely to the host) and include vital aspects of metabolism and physiology. Here, as a special section, we present a set of papers that address the complex interactions between plants and root microbiomes in the rhizosphere.

The effects of grazing on plant C, N, P contents and stoichiometry across hierarchical levels, however, have rarely been studied; particularly whether the effects are mediated by resource availability and the underpinning mechanisms remain largely unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a multi-organization-level approach, we examined the effects of grazing on the C, N, and P contents and stoichiometry in plant tissues (leaves and roots) and linkages to ecosystem functioning across three vegetation types (meadow, meadow steppe, and typical steppe) in the Inner Mongolia grassland, China. Our results showed that the effects of grazing on the C, N, and P contents and stoichiometry in leaves and roots differed substantially among vegetation types and across different hierarchical levels (species, functional group, and vegetation type levels). The magnitude of positive effects of grazing on leaf N and P contents increased progressively along the hierarchy of organizational levels in the meadow, whereas its negative effect on leaf N content decreased considerably along hierarchical levels in both the typical and meadow steppes. Grazing increased N and P allocation to aboveground in the meadow, while greater N and P allocation to belowground was found in the typical and meadow steppes. The differences in soil properties, plant trait-based resource use strategies, tolerance or defense strategies to grazing, and shifts in functional group composition are likely to be the key mechanisms for the observed patterns among vegetation types. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that the enhanced vegetation-type-level N contents by grazing and species compensatory feedbacks may be insufficient to prevent widespread declines in primary productivity in the Inner Mongolia grassland. Hence, it is essential to reduce the currently high stocking rates and restore the vast degraded steppes for sustainable development of arid and semiarid grasslands.

Although parasites represent just 1% of all angiosperms, the ecophysiological traits associated with parasitism confer pronounced impacts on their hosts and disproportionate influence upon community structure, composition, and broader ecosystem function. New insights into the roles of their pollinators, seed dispersers, and litter-dependent detritivores have advanced our understanding of how parasitic plants modulate animal communities via their extended and complementary phenology. Direct and indirect impacts of climate change on parasitic plants and their ecological roles are already apparent. Trade-offs between maximizing efficiency at obtaining water from hosts and sensitivity to water stress underlie range shifts and host switching of parasitic plants and increased reliance on these plants by animal communities for food and shelter.","[Watson, David M.; McLellan, Richard C.] Charles Sturt Univ, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Watson, David M.; McLellan, Richard C.] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Inst Biol, Valparaiso, Chile; [Fonturbel, Francisco E.] Millennium Nucleus Patagonian Limit Life LiLi, Valdivia, Chile",Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso,"Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Gulbali Inst, Albury, NSW, Australia.;Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr Environm & Vet Sci, Albury, NSW, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,"Fontúrbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009","Fontúrbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816; McLellan, Richard/0000-0002-9897-0763; David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632",,,,NA,142,2,2,8,8,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Such knowledge is key for the implementation of biodiversity conservation. We identify the relationships between peatland vegetation and hydrological conditions over the past 2000 years using plant macrofossils, testate amoebae-based quantitative hydrological reconstructions and Sphagnum-moss functional traits from seven Polish peatland records. Using threshold indicator taxa analysis, we discovered that plant community composition strongly converged at a water level of ca 11.7 cm, indicating a community-level tipping point. We identified 45 plant taxa that showed either an increase or a decrease in their relative abundance between 8 and 17 cm of water-level depth. Our analysis of Sphagnum community traits further showed that Sphagnum functional diversity was remarkably stable over time despite Sphagnum species sensitivity to hydrological conditions. Our results suggest that past hydrological shifts did not influence major functions of the Sphagnum community, such as photosynthetic capacity, growth and productivity, owing to species replacement with a similar functional space. Although further studies including trait plasticity will be required, our findings suggest that the capacity of the Sphagnum community to gain carbon remained stable despite hydrological changes.","[Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Marcisz, Katarzyna; Kajukalo-Drygalska, Katarzyna] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Lab Wetland Ecol & Monitoring, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Marcisz, Katarzyna; Kajukalo-Drygalska, Katarzyna] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Biogeog & Palaeoecol, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Galka, Mariusz] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Geobot & Plant Ecol, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Slowinski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Dept Environm Resources & Geohazards, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland; [Dayras, Milva Druguet; Jassey, Vincent E.

This study investigates intertrophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition. We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM), and tree identity. The site was a 4-year-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures. Microbial community composition, community-level physiological profiles, and respiration were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and the MicroResp (TM) system, respectively. The relationship between tree species richness and glucose-induced respiration (GIR), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) followed a positive but saturating shape. Microbial communities associated with species mixtures were more active (basal respiration [BR]), with higher biomass (glucose-induced respiration [GIR]), and used a greater number of carbon sources than monocultures. Communities associated with deciduous tree species used a greater number of carbon sources than those associated with evergreen species, suggesting a greater soil carbon storage capacity. There were no differences in microbial composition (PLFA) between monocultures and SR mixtures. The FD and the CWM of several functional traits affected both BR and GIR. In general, the CWM of traits had stronger effects than did FD, suggesting that certain traits of dominant species have more effect on ecosystem processes than does FD. Both the functions of GIR and BR were positively related to aboveground tree community productivity. Both tree diversity (SR) and identity (species and functional identityleaf habit) affected soil microbial community respiration, biomass, and composition. For the first time, we identified functional traits related to life-history strategy, as well as root traits that influence another trophic level, soil microbial community function, via effects on BR and GIR.","[Khlifa, Rim; Munson, Alison D.] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Paquette, Alain; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Feuillue Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia",Laval University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University,"Khlifa, R (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Foret, Dept Sci Bois & Foret, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",rim.khlifa@gmail.com,"Khlifa, Rim/AAC-6290-2019; Reich, Paul/D-4321-2013; Munson, Alison/B-1248-2013","Khlifa, Rim/0000-0003-3645-7558; Reich, Paul/0000-0003-1192-5909; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X; Munson, Alison/0000-0001-6013-7998",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

However, we lack a systematic understanding of FR on both the species level (which species are functionally rare and why) and the community level (how is FR associated with biodiversity and environmental conditions). Here, we quantify FR for 218 plant species from German hay meadows on a local, regional, and national scale by combining data from 6500 vegetation releves and 15 ecologically relevant traits. We investigate the association between rarity and trait distinctiveness on different spatial scales via correlation measures and show which traits lead to low or high trait distinctiveness via distance-based redundancy analysis. We test how species richness and FR are correlated, and use boosted regression trees to determine environmental conditions that are driving species richness and FR. On the local scale, only rare species showed high trait distinctiveness while on larger spatial scales rare and common species showed high trait distinctiveness. As infrequent trait attributes (e.g., legumes, low clonality) led to higher trait distinctiveness, we argue that functionally rare species are either specialists or transients. While specialists occupy a particular niche in hay meadows leading to lower rarity on larger spatial scales, transients display distinct but maladaptive traits resulting in high rarity across all spatial scales. More functionally rare species than expected by chance occurred in species-poor communities indicating that they prefer environmental conditions differing from characteristic conditions of species-rich hay meadows. Finally, we argue that functionally rare species are not necessarily relevant for nature conservation because many were transients from surrounding habitats. However, FR can facilitate our understanding of why species are rare in a habitat and under which conditions these species occur.","[Walther, Gabriel; Roemermann, Christine] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Jena, Germany; [Walther, Gabriel; Roemermann, Christine] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Jandt, Ute] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Max Planck Society,"Walther, G (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Plant Biodivers, Philosophenweg 16, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",gabriel.walther@uni-jena.de,"Kattge, Jens/J-8283-2016","Kattge, Jens/0000-0002-1022-8469; Romermann, Christine/0000-0003-3471-0951; Walther, Gabriel/0000-0003-3550-9045; Jandt, Ute/0000-0002-3177-3669",Federal State of Thuringia; Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena,Federal State of Thuringia; Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena,Federal State of Thuringia; Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena,NA,116,0,0,5,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, it remains unclear whether these relationships should be expected in secondary forests. In this study, we hypothesized that the multifunctionality (EMF) is affected by the climate dependency of tree-species diversity and stand attribute diversity in a secondary forest dominated by Pinus yunnanensis. By using forest inventory data from a wide range of areas, we quantified the aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon, ratio of soil carbon and nitrogen, total soil nitrogen, total soil phosphorus, total soil potassium, tree-species diversity, and stand attribute diversity (i.e., individual tree-size variations). We also quantified the climate data, including the mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). We found that a higher MAT directly constrains all the ecosystem multifunctionalities (EMFs) and three of the five single functions. A higher MAP was negatively correlated with all the EMFs and four of the five single functions, but indirectly through diversity indices. Stand attribute diversity better explained the EMFs rather than tree species diversity. Meanwhile, most of the single functions were highly correlated with stand attribute diversity rather than tree species diversity. These results highlight the importance of diversity in promoting forest multifunctionality and underscore the importance of the climate context in defining EMF and shaping the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions. We argue that the climate context should be taken into account when maximizing forest complexity, so as to enhance the multifunctionality of Pinus yunnanensis secondary forests.","[Wang, Lei; Huang, Xiaobo; Su, Jianrong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Highland Forest Sci, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei] Yunnan Acad Forestry & Grassland, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiaobo; Su, Jianrong] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Puer Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Forestry,"Su, JR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Highland Forest Sci, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Su, JR (corresponding author), Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Puer Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",wang-lei-yaf@foxmail.com; huangxiaobo2430046@126.com; jianrongsu@vip.sina.com,,"WANG, Lei/0000-0002-1735-074X",Provincial key research and development program of Yunnan [2018BB006]; Provincial technical innovation talent development program of Yunnan [202205AD160018],Provincial key research and development program of Yunnan; Provincial technical innovation talent development program of Yunnan,This research was funded by Provincial key research and development program of Yunnan [2018BB006] and Provincial technical innovation talent development program of Yunnan [202205AD160018].,NA,59,0,0,15,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2022,14,14,,NA,,NA,,,8332,10.3390/su14148332,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14148332,NA,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,3H7ZJ,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000832250400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biodiversity experiments have identified both complementarity and selection as important drivers of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, their relative importance in above- and below-ground ecosystem compartments of mature forests remains yet to be explored. 2. We adopted a trait-based approach to partition biodiversity effects in above- and below-ground complementarity and selection. This approach was based on canopy and root traits measured in single- and mixed-species plots in mature forests across a European latitudinal gradient. 3. We assessed the relative importance of above- and below-ground selection and complementarity in driving the relationship between tree species diversity and above-ground wood production. We used the expected values (based on the values measured in monocultures) of leaf area index (LAI) and fine root biomass as proxies for above- and below-ground selection, whereas canopy packing and rooting depth variability were used as proxies for above- and below-ground complementarity. 4. Our results showed that tree species richness-wood production relationships were driven by above- and below-ground complementarity (i.e. canopy packing and rooting depth variability), rather than selection. The proxies for selection were found to have a positive effect on wood production but were not affected by tree species richness. 5. We concluded that above-ground-but also the largely neglected below-ground complementarity drives biodiversity-productivity relationships in mature forests. Our findings suggest that choosing tree species with complementary above- and below-ground traits should be considered in afforestation and forest management to promote tree diversity and productivity in European forests.","[Jing, Xin; Muys, Bart; Desie, Ellen; Vancampenhout, Karen; Zuo, Juan; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Hattenschwiler, Stephan] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Jactel, Herve] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, BIOGECO, Cestas, France; [Jaroszewicz, Bogdan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Bialowieza Geobot Stn, Bialowieza, Poland; [Kardol, Paul] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden; [Ratcliffe, Sophia] NBN Trust, Nottingham, England; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Selvi, Federico] Univ Firenze, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry, Florence, Italy; [van der Plas, Fons] Univ Leipzig, Systemat Bot & Funct Biodivers Life Sci, Leipzig, Germany; [van der Plas, Fons] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Forest & Nat Lab, Campus Gontrode, Melle Gontrode, Belgium; [Vesterdal, Lars] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Zuo, Juan] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan, Peoples R China","KU Leuven; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; University of Warsaw; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Freiburg; University of Florence; Leipzig University; Wageningen University & Research; Ghent University; University of Copenhagen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS","Van Meerbeek, K (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Leuven, Belgium.",koenraad.vanmeerbeek@kuleuven.be,"Jing, Xin/I-7882-2016; van der Plas, Fons/A-2242-2017; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/C-9007-2016; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; Vesterdal, Lars/D-5227-2011; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; Muys, Bart/ABN-3906-2022; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/AAC-8184-2020; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Vancampenhout, Karen/B-6956-2018","Jing, Xin/0000-0002-7146-7180; van der Plas, Fons/0000-0003-4680-543X; Van Meerbeek, Koenraad/0000-0002-9260-3815; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Vesterdal, Lars/0000-0003-0309-3735; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; Muys, Bart/0000-0001-9421-527X; Jaroszewicz, Bogdan/0000-0002-2042-8245; JACTEL, Herve/0000-0002-8106-5310; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Vancampenhout, Karen/0000-0002-9159-7011; Ratcliffe, Sophia/0000-0001-9284-7900; Desie, Ellen/0000-0002-5947-9517",KU Leuven; European Union [265171],KU Leuven(KU Leuven); European Union(European Commission),"Internal Funds of the KU Leuven; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), Grant/Award Number: 265171",NA,95,10,10,18,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Ecological field studies often use 'low-throughput' methods to assess plant phenotypes and integrate species-specific traits to community-wide indices. In contrast, agricultural greenhouse or lab-based studies often employ 'high-throughput phenotyping' to assess plant individuals tracking their growth or fertilizer and water demand. In ecological field studies, remote sensing makes use of freely movable devices like satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which provide large-scale spatial and temporal data. Adopting such methods for community ecology on a smaller scale may provide novel insights on the phenotypic properties of plant communities and fill the gap between traditional field measurements and airborne remote sensing. However, the trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and scope of the respective study requires highly specific setups so that the measurements fit the scientific question. We introduce small-scale, high-resolution digital automated phenotyping as a novel source of quantitative trait data in ecological field studies that provides complementary multi-faceted data of plant communities. We customized an automated plant phenotyping system for its mobile application in the field for 'digital whole-community phenotyping' (DWCP), capturing the 3-dimensional structure and multispectral information of plant communities. We demonstrated the potential of DWCP by recording plant community responses to experimental land-use treatments over two years. DWCP captured changes in morphological and physiological community properties in response to mowing and fertilizer treatments and thus reliably informed about changes in land-use. In contrast, manually measured community-weighted mean traits and species composition remained largely unaffected and were not informative about these treatments. DWCP proved to be an efficient method for characterizing plant communities, complements other methods in trait-based ecology, provides indicators of ecosystem states, and may help to forecast tipping points in plant communities often associated with irreversible changes in ecosystems.","[Zieschank, Vincent; Junker, Robert R.] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Plants, Marburg, Germany; [Junker, Robert R.] Univ Salzburg, Dept Environm & Biodivers, Salzburg, Austria",Philipps University Marburg; Salzburg University,"Junker, RR (corresponding author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Ecol Plants, Marburg, Germany.;Junker, RR (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Dept Environm & Biodivers, Salzburg, Austria.",robert.junker@uni-marburg.de,,,"DFG [Ju 2856/4-1]; Philipps-Universitaet Marburg; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)","DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Philipps-Universitaet Marburg; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The work has been funded by the DFG Priority Program 1374 Biodiversity- Exploratories (Ju 2856/4-1).

A rich body of evidence from local-scale experiments and observational studies has revealed stabilizing effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. However, whether these effects emerge across entire regions and continents remains largely overlooked. Here we combine data on the distribution of more than 57,500 plant species and remote-sensing observations throughout the entire Western Hemisphere to investigate the role of multiple facets of plant diversity (species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity) in mediating the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate variability at the regional-scale over the past 20 years. We show that, across multiple biomes, regions of greater plant diversity exhibit lower sensitivity (more stable over time) to temperature variability at the interannual and seasonal-scales. While these areas can display lower sensitivity to interannual variability in precipitation, they emerge as highly sensitive to precipitation seasonality. Conserving landscapes of greater diversity may help stabilize ecosystem functioning under climate change, possibly securing the continuous provisions of productivity-related ecosystem service to people.","[Oliveira, Brunno F.; Moore, Frances C.; Dong, Xiaoli] Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Oliveira, Brunno F.] Ctr Synth & Anal Biodivers CESAB, FRB, Montpellier, France",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Oliveira, BF (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Oliveira, BF (corresponding author), Ctr Synth & Anal Biodivers CESAB, FRB, Montpellier, France.",brunno.oliveira@me.com,,"Oliveira, Brunno/0000-0002-2982-149X; Moore, Frances/0000-0003-3866-9642",National Science Foundation [1924378]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1924378] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology [1924378] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),We are thankful to Susan P.

The approach was designed and has been widely used for the study of yield in mixed-species situations taking into account the relative abundance of each species in ecosystem-level yield. However, complex functional traits commonly used to integrate ecosystem-level properties that cannot be analysed like yield data because the weighted contribution of each species is not determined by its relative abundance. We adapted the original method by clearly identifying ecologically meaningful weighting coefficients to represent species-specific contributions to ecosystem function. We applied the adapted method of analysis to tree foliar carbon isotope composition in an experimental plantation in order to test the influence of species richness on plot water use efficiency (WUEplot). The appropriate weights for the WUEplot of each species are leaf CO2 assimilation rate. We observed a large range of WUEplot and biodiversity effects among plots. The absence of a significant SE on WUEplot indicated that the overall net biodiversity effect was primarily driven by a CE. The net biodiversity effect and CE were mostly negative, suggesting that interspecific interactions resulted in a decrease in the ratio between carbon acquisition and transpiration at the ecosystem level. The application of the method to complex components of ecosystem functioning provides important new insights into the practical and conceptual aspects of functional biodiversity research.","[Grossiord, Charlotte; Granier, Andre; Bonal, Damien] INRA, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Gessler, Arthur] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Landscape Biogeochem, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol Geobot, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; [Pollastrini, Martina] Univ Florence, Dept Plant Biol, I-50144 Florence, Italy",INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); University of Freiburg; University of Florence,"Bonal, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres 1137, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",bonal@nancy.inra.fr,"Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; , Martina/N-7989-2014; Pollastrini, Martina/Y-1046-2019","Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; , Martina/0000-0003-0959-9489; Pollastrini, Martina/0000-0003-0959-9489; Grossiord, Charlotte/0000-0002-9113-3671",European Union Seventh Framework Programme [265171]; BACCARA project [226299]; French National Research Agency through the Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE [ANR-12-LABXARBRE-01]; INRA Nancy,European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); BACCARA project; French National Research Agency through the Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE(French National Research Agency (ANR)); INRA Nancy,"We thank Laureline Bes De Berc for her considerable technical support in leaf or needle collection and grinding.

Despite increasing reports of severe drought and heat impacts on forest ecosystems, community-level processes, which could potentially modulate tree responses to climatic stress, are rarely accounted for. While numerous studies indicate a positive effect of species diversity on a wide range of ecosystem functions and services, little is known about how species interactions influence tree responses to climatic variability. 2. We quantified the intraspecific variation in 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological and anatomical traits in mature beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at six sites located along a climatic gradient in the French Alps. At each site, we studied pure beech and mixed stands with silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.). We tested how functional traits differed between the two species mixtures (pure vs. mixed stands) within each site and along the climatic gradient. 3. We found significant changes in many traits along the climatic gradient as conditions progressively got drier and warmer. Independent of the mixture, reduced leaf-level CO2 assimilation, stomatal size and thicker leaf cuticles, consistent with a more conservative resource use strategy, were found. At the drier sites, higher foliar stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13), thicker mesophyll tissues and lower specific leaf area (SLA) in pure stands suggest that beech had more acquisitive traits there compared to mixed stands. At the wetter sites, trees in beech-silver fir mixtures had higher chlorophyll concentration, lower delta C-13, larger xylem vessels and higher SLA, suggesting a more acquisitive resource use strategy in mixed stands than in pure stands. 4. Our work revealed that species interactions are significant modulators of functional traits, and that they can be just as important drivers of intraspecific trait variation as climatic conditions. We show that downy oak mixtures lead to an adaptive drought response by common beech in dry environments. In contrast, in milder climates, interactions with silver fir seem to increase beech resource acquisition and productivity. These findings highlight a strong context dependency and imply that incorporating local interspecific interactions in research on climate impacts could improve our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics.","[Didion-Gency, Margaux; Gessler, Arthur; Vollenweider, Pierre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Forest Dynam Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Bachofen, Christoph; Grossiord, Charlotte] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Plant Ecol Res Lab PERL, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bachofen, Christoph; Grossiord, Charlotte] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Community Ecol Unit, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Morin, Xavier] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFEIRD,IRD,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Vicente, Eduardo] Univ Alicante, Joint Res Unit Univ Alicante CEAM, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; Universitat d'Alacant","Didion-Gency, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Forest Dynam Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",margaux.didion@wsl.ch,"Vollenweider, Pierre/L-9315-2013; Morin, Xavier/B-2790-2015; Buchmann, Nina/E-6095-2011; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008","Vollenweider, Pierre/0000-0002-4995-1419; Morin, Xavier/0000-0003-1961-8700; Buchmann, Nina/0000-0003-0826-2980; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Vicente, Eduardo/0000-0001-5867-4989; Grossiord, Charlotte/0000-0002-9113-3671; Didion-Gency, Margaux/0000-0001-8967-3655; Bachofen, Christoph/0000-0002-5269-0299",Swiss National Science Foundation SNF,Swiss National Science Foundation SNF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Swiss National Science Foundation SNF,NA,62,4,4,10,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Grass-legume mixtures are commonly cultivated to increase grassland productivity while reducing the need for nitrogen (N) fertiliser. However, little is known about the effect of this increase in productivity on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in grass-legume mixtures. The aim of this study was to investigate interactions between the proportion of legumes in grass-legume mixtures and N-fertiliser addition on productivity and GHG emissions. We tested the hypotheses that an increase in the relative proportion of legumes would increase plant productivity and decrease GHG emissions, and the magnitude of these effects would be reduced by N-fertiliser addition. Methods This was tested in a controlled environment mesocosm experiment with one grass and one legume species grown in mixtures in different proportions, with or without N-fertiliser. The effects on N cycling processes were assessed by measurement of above- and below-ground biomass, shoot N uptake, soil physico-chemical properties and GHG emissions. Results Above-ground productivity and shoot N uptake were greater in legume-grass mixtures compared to grass or legume monocultures, in fertilised and unfertilised soils. However, we found no effect of legume proportion on N2O emissions, total soil N or mineral-N in fertilised or unfertilised soils. Conclusions This study shows that the inclusion of legumes in grass-legume mixtures positively affected productivity, however N cycle were in the short-term unaffected and mainly affected by nitrogen fertilisation. Legumes can be used in grassland management strategies to mitigate climate change by reducing crop demand for N-fertilisers.","[Barneze, Arlete S.; Ostle, Nicholas J.] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England; [Barneze, Arlete S.; Whitaker, Jeanette; McNamara, Niall P.] Lancaster Environm Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Lib Ave, Lancaster LA1 4AP, England",N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),"Barneze, AS (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",arletesb@gmail.com,"Ostle, Nick J/K-6891-2012; Barneze, Arlete/T-9421-2019; McNamara, Niall P/B-4907-2008; Whitaker, Jeanette/A-9266-2013; Ostle, Nicholas/E-4847-2014","Barneze, Arlete/0000-0001-5781-0424; McNamara, Niall P/0000-0002-5143-5819; Whitaker, Jeanette/0000-0001-8824-471X; Ostle, Nicholas/0000-0003-3263-3702","BBSRC [BB/I008969/1, BB/I008969/2] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/M016757/1] Funding Source: UKRI",BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,NA,77,18,19,11,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0032-079X,1573-5036,,PLANT SOIL,Plant Soil,JAN,2020,446,1-fev.,,NA,,NA,163,177,,10.1007/s11104-019-04338-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04338-w,NA,,15,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,KI8GJ,NA,"hybrid, Green Accepted",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000511594900010,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regression analyses were used to test for significant effects of plant community diversity, host species abundance and soil fertility at grasslands in the lower and upper alpine belt. ResultsWe found a positive correlation of the incidence of folivory with local plant species richness, soil fertility and local host species abundance. The effects of community traits were stronger at higher altitudes, although the overall level of herbivory was lower at higher altitudes. Taxa lacking strong chemical defences, but possessing either high nutrient or high silica content, were particularly strongly and weakly affected by herbivory, respectively. ConclusionsThese results are in line with predictions derived from the resource availability hypothesis, but remain ambiguous concerning the resource concentration hypothesis. The degree of herbivory not only depends on traits of hosts but also on features of the surrounding plant community. The generally high incidence of herbivory with low levels of damage suggests that insect folivores are omnipresent in high-altitude grasslands.","[Huelber, Karl; Haider, Julian A.; Hager, Theresa E.; Dullinger, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Vienna, Austria; [Huelber, Karl; Dullinger, Stefan] Vienna Inst Nat Conservat & Anal, Vienna, Austria; [Fiedler, Konrad] Univ Vienna, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Divers, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; University of Vienna,"Hulber, K (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Conservat Biol Vegetat Ecol & Landscape Ecol, Rennweg 14, Vienna, Austria.",karl.huelber@univie.ac.at; a0800864@unet.univie.ac.at; theresa.e.hager@gmail.com; stefan.dullinger@univie.ac.at; konrad.fiedler@univie.ac.at,"Fiedler, Konrad/H-8788-2019; Hülber, Karl/H-7822-2019","Fiedler, Konrad/0000-0002-4789-3753; Hülber, Karl/0000-0001-9274-1647; Dullinger, Stefan/0000-0003-3919-0887",,,,NA,72,4,5,1,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

We hypothesised that with increasing intertidal elevation, traits of large brown macroalgae would reflect a resource acquisition vs. conservation (stress tolerance) trade-off at species and community levels. Across the elevation gradient at four UK sites of varying wave exposure, we: (1) screened species' relevant morphological traits, using principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality; and (2) up-scaled species' traits using community weighted trait means (CWMs). The first principal component (PC1) strongly related to specific thallus area and thallus dry matter content, representing an acquisition-conservation trade-off. Although species generally shifted to the conservative end of this axis as elevation increased, mid-shore Ascophyllum nodosum sat at the extreme conservative end. PC2 related to holdfast ratio, thickness and length, with A. nodosum scoring higher than other mid-shore species. CWMs of PC1 decreased with elevation at two sites indicating a shift from 'fast' to 'slow' ecosystem functioning, but this relationship was disrupted by A. nodosum at the sheltered site, and by the up-shore extent of Laminaria digitata at the most exposed site. The anomalous traits of A. nodosum reflect its unique competitive strategy (slow, persistent growth) in the relatively stressful mid-shore. Seaweed functional traits show promise in linking species' identities to their strategies and ecosystem contributions. However, because resource conservation traits can be related to competitive as well as stress-tolerance strategies, predicting seaweed trait responses to environmental stress gradients is challenging.","[Cappelatti, Laura; Mauffrey, Alizee R.

Plant communities with a diversity of phenology responses could show a longer greening season due to more complete occupation of the temporal window available for growth. However, it is unclear how species composition and richness affect the phenology of local plant communities. Location This study was conducted in wetland landscapes of the St. Lawrence River in the province of Quebec, Canada (46.07 degrees N; 73.17 degrees W). Methods We used close-range digital imagery to monitor the greening phenology and species richness of 20 herbaceous plant communities from 2013 to 2016. We quantified the number of greening phenology patterns observed each year within each plant community using singular value decomposition of close-range image time series. Results The number of plant species within plant communities was independent of the number of phenology patterns, or the length of the greening season. However, the number of phenology patterns correlated positively to the greening season length in all four years of monitoring. Conclusions The relationship between the number of phenology patterns and the greening season length suggests a complementary use of the temporal window available for growth within plant communities. Species richness was a poor indicator of the diversity of phenology responses in wet meadow communities. The absence of a positive relationship between the number of plant species and the diversity of greening phenology patterns, or the length of the greening season, suggests that other descriptors of plant communities are of importance. Species richness is more often than not a weak predictor of the functioning of local plant communities in the wild.","[Rheault, Guillaume; Proulx, Raphael; Robin, Yoann] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Chaire Rech Integrite Ecol, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada; [Rheault, Guillaume; Proulx, Raphael; Levesque, Esther] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Sur Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aq, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada; [Rheault, Guillaume; Levesque, Esther] Univ Laval Quebec, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada; [Proulx, Raphael] Univ Montreal, Grp Rech Interuniv Limnol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Levesque, Esther] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Grp Rech Biol Vegetale, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; Laval University; Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres,"Rheault, G (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Chaire Rech Integrite Ecol, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada.",guillaume.rheault@uqtr.ca,,"Proulx, Raphael/0000-0002-9188-9225; Levesque, Esther/0000-0002-1119-6032; Rheault, Guillaume/0000-0003-4058-1893",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fond de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies; Network of Centers for Excellence ArcticNet; Northern Scientific Training Program; Centre de Recherche sur les Interactions Bassins Versants-Ecosystemes Aquatiques,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Fond de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies; Network of Centers for Excellence ArcticNet; Northern Scientific Training Program; Centre de Recherche sur les Interactions Bassins Versants-Ecosystemes Aquatiques,"Financial support was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (E.L., R.

Within the phytoplankton, functional groups (characterized by distinct traits) have impacts on other major biogeochemical cycles, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and silica. Changes in phytoplankton community structure, resulting from the unique environmental sensitivities of these groups, may significantly alter elemental cycling from local to global scales. We review key traits that distinguish major phytoplankton functional groups, how they affect biogeochemistry and how the links between community structure and biogeochemical cycles are modelled. Finally, we explore how global environmental change will affect phytoplankton communities, from the traits of individual species to the relative abundance of functional groups, and how that, in turn, may alter biogeochemical cycles.Synthesis. We can increase our mechanistic understanding of the links between the community structure of primary producers and biogeochemistry by focusing on traits determining functional group responses to the environment (response traits) and their biogeochemical functions (effect traits). Identifying trade-offs including allometric and phylogenetic constraints among traits will help parameterize predictive biogeochemical models, enhancing our ability to anticipate the consequences of global change.","[Litchman, Elena; Klausmeier, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [de Tezanos Pinto, Paula] Univ Buenos Aires, IEGEBA CONICET UBA, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Edwards, Kyle F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Klausmeier, Christopher A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kremer, Colin T.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kremer, Colin T.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci Program, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Thomas, Mridul K.] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Buenos Aires; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Michigan State University; Yale University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Princeton University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG),"Litchman, E (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",litchman@msu.edu,"Klausmeier, Christopher A/J-9339-2012; Thomas, Mridul/HZL-6270-2023; Kremer, Colin/AAH-7022-2021","Thomas, Mridul/0000-0002-5089-5610; Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332; Klausmeier, Christopher/0000-0002-6987-5871; , Kyle/0000-0002-0661-3903","NSF; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [0845932, 1136710] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [0928819] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences [1402074] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Ocean Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Div Of Biological Infrastructure; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"This work was in part supported by the NSF grants to EL and CAK, and the NSF postdoctoral fellowship to CTK.",NA,141,110,112,25,307,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

This review summarizes the current knowledge on fine root production, mortality and longevity in deep soil layers, mycorrhizal association with deep roots, and the role of deep fine roots on carbon, water and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Plant species are known to be more deeply rooted in tropical ecosystems than in temperate and boreal ecosystems, but deep-rooted species are common in a wide range of climates. Deep fine roots are highly plastic in response to changes in environmental conditions and soil resources. Recent studies show that functional traits can be different for deep and shallow roots, with a possible functional specialization of deep fine roots to take up nutrients. With higher vessel diameter and larger tracheid, the anatomy of deep fine roots is also oriented toward water acquisition and transport by increasing the hydraulic conductivity. Deep fine roots can have a great impact on the biogeochemical cycles in many forests (in particular in tropical areas where highly weathered soils are commonly very deep), making it possible to take up water and nutrients over dry periods and contributing to store carbon in the soil. The biogeochemical models in forest ecosystems need to consider the specificity of deep root functioning to better predict carbon, water and nutrient cycling as well as net ecosystem productivity.","[Germon, Amandine; Laclau, Jean-Paul] Sao Paulo State Univ, Sch Agr Sci, UNESP, BR-18610307 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Germon, Amandine; Laclau, Jean-Paul; Robin, Agnes; Jourdan, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, CIRAD,IRD,Eco&Sols, Montpellier, France; [Laclau, Jean-Paul; Robin, Agnes; Jourdan, Christophe] CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Robin, Agnes] Luiz de Queiroz Univ Sao Paulo, Soil Sci Dept, ESALQ, Escola Super Agr, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual Paulista; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Jourdan, C (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR Eco&Sols, F-34060 Montpellier, France.",christophe.jourdan@cirad.fr,"Robin, Agnes/C-5238-2015; Laclau, Jean-Paul/D-8285-2012; Germon, Amandine/M-4403-2015","Laclau, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-2506-214X; Germon, Amandine/0000-0001-8687-294X; JOURDAN, Christophe/0000-0001-9857-3269","Sao Paulo Research Foundation scholarship (FAPESP) [2015/24911-8, 2017/13572-3]",Sao Paulo Research Foundation scholarship (FAPESP),"The financial support of the Sao Paulo Research Foundation scholarship (FAPESP, Projects 2015/24911-8 and 2017/13572-3) for Amandine Germon is gratefully acknowledged.",NA,234,39,40,20,162,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,1872-7042,,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Although several biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments have demonstrated the importance of functional complementarity in enhancing plant community performance, no biodiversity experiment has yet manipulated facilitation to test its contribution to how the complementarity effect (CE) modulates community performance.We built a restoration experiment manipulating diversity and facilitation potential in a tropical semi-arid forest. We planted 4704 seedlings of 16 native tree species to assemble 147 experimental communities with 45 different compositions comprising 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species. Facilitation potential was included in the experimental design by creating a gradient of communities from low to high facilitation potential (based on prior research). We measured functional dispersion and functional identity using species above- and below-ground traits to investigate how they modulate the effects of species diversity and facilitation potential on leaf biomass production, using the additive partition biodiversity effects CE and selection effect (SE).The joint influence of diversity and facilitation potential was tested separately for leaf biomass production and net biodiversity effect using linear mixed models (LMMs). We subsequently ran LMMs including functional dispersion and functional identity. We hypothesised that facilitation potential would increase community productivity and functioning and that functional dispersion and functional identity related to above- and below-ground traits would explain facilitation performance.Facilitation potential positively influenced leaf biomass production as predicted, but unexpectedly, neither of the functional traits were important for modulating the facilitation process. Positive values for CE showed that plants performed better in mixtures in comparison to monocultures. SE negative values, showed that species with below average performance in monocultures, performed better in mixtures. Unexpectedly, CE did not increase as species diversity or facilitation potential increased. The SE was influenced negatively by facilitation potential leading to a more equal distribution of biomass production between species in mixtures.Synthesis. Facilitation improves biomass production in restored communities and increases biomass equitability among plant species and thus ecosystem reliability. To improve restoration success, plant communities should be built using a combination of facilitative species.","[Fagundes, Marina V.; Ganade, Gislene] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Restorat Ecol Lab, Natal, Brazil; [Mazzochini, Guilherme G.] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Inst Biosci, Dept Plant Biol, Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Ganade, G (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, Restorat Ecol Lab, Natal, Brazil.",gganade@gmail.com,"Ganade, Gislene/F-4863-2016; Mazzochini, Guilherme Gerhardt/D-1077-2017","Ganade, Gislene/0000-0002-9291-1025; Mazzochini, Guilherme Gerhardt/0000-0002-6932-8544; Fagundes, Marina/0000-0002-9358-9488","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [3316924/2021-0, 441684/2020-3, 441684/2020-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [001]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo - FAPESP [2019/18145-1]",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo - FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 3316924/2021-0, 441684/2020-3 and 441684/2020-7; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: 001; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo - FAPESP, Grant/Award Number: 2019/18145-1",NA,63,0,0,19,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, identifying the direction of the productivity-stability relationship remains challenging because ecological stability has multiple components that can display neutral, positive or negative covariations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the direction of the productivity-stability relationship depends on the biotic interactions and abiotic conditions that underlie ecosystem productivity and stability. We decipher the relationships between grassland productivity and two components of its stability in four habitat types with contrasting environments and flora.Location: France.Time period: 2000-2020.Major taxa: Grassland plant species.Methods: We used c. 20,000 vegetation plots spread across French permanent grasslands and remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify grassland productivity and temporal stability. We decomposed stability into constancy (i.e., temporal invariability) and resistance (i.e., maximum deviation from average) and deciphered the direct and indirect effects of abiotic (namely growing season length and nitrogen input) and biotic (namely plant taxonomic diversity, trait diversity and community-weighted mean traits) factors on productivity-stability relationships using structural equation models.Results: We found a positive relationship between productivity and constancy and a negative relationship between productivity and resistance in all habitats. Abiotic factors had stronger effects on productivity and stability compared with biotic factors. A longer growing season enhanced grassland productivity and constancy. Nitrogen input had positive and negative effects on grassland productivity and resistance, respectively. Trait values affected the constancy and resistance of grassland more than taxonomic and trait diversity, with effects varying from one habitat to another. Productivity was not related to any biotic factor.Main conclusions: Our findings reveal how vital it is to consider both the multiple components of stability and the interaction between environment and biodiversity to gain an understanding of the relationships between productivity and stability in real-world ecosystems, which is a crucial step for sustainable grassland management.","[Mahaut, Lucie; Garnier, Eric; Renard, Delphine; Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier, CEFE, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Choler, Philippe; Thuiller, Wilfried; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LECA,Lab Ecol Alpine, Grenoble, France; [Denelle, Pierre] Univ Gottingen, Biodivers Macroecol & Biogeog, Gottingen, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Kattge, Jens] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Lemauviel-Lavenant, Servane] Normandy Univ, UNICAEN, INRAE, EVA, Caen, France; [Munoz, Francois] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab Interdisciplinaire Phys, Grenoble, France; [Serra-Diaz, Josep M.] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRAE, Silva, Nancy, France; [Viovy, Nicolas] CEA Paris Saclay, LSCE, Orme Merisiers, Bat 714, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Mahaut, Lucie] UMR CEFE, 1919 route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France",UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; University of Gottingen; Max Planck Society; INRAE; Universite de Caen Normandie; UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); AgroParisTech; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier,"Mahaut, L (autor correspondente), UMR CEFE, 1919 route Mende, F-34090 Montpellier, France.",lucie.mahaut1@gmail.com,"; Garnier, Eric/D-1650-2012","Mahaut, Lucie/0000-0002-5825-3807; Garnier, Eric/0000-0002-9392-5154",French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB); EDF in the context of the CESAB project; FRB; EDF; French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; French National Research Agency under the Programme Investissements d'Avenir [ANR 17 MPGA 0004]; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.,French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB); EDF in the context of the CESAB project; FRB; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; French National Research Agency under the Programme Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.,"This research was supported by the French Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB; ) and EDF in the context of the CESAB project Causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales (FREE), by the FRB, EDF and French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) in the context of the CESAB project Functional rarity as a marker of land use intensification and ecosystem functions in French permanent grasslands (FunIndic) and by the FRB in the context of the CESAB project Assembling, analysing and sharing data on plant functional diversity to understand the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning: a case study with French Permanent Grasslands (DIVGRASS).

Quantifying how plant diversity affects Rs is critical for predicting the impact of global plant diversity loss on ecosystem function. However, it is unclear how soil factors and plant diversity are spatially interrelated under natural environmental gradients, and how plant diversity affects the spatial variation of Rs on the basis of soil factors. Our objectives were to quantify the direction and magnitude of direct and indirect effects of plant diversity on Rs. We assessed spatial variability in the relationships between soil factors (soil chemistry and microclimate), multiple dimensions of plant diversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity), and Rs using a new combination of geographically weighted regression and structural equation modeling based on survey data from three plots (river bank, transitional zone, and desert margin plots) along an environmental gradient in northwest China. Reduced plant diversity had a negative impact on Rs. However, when the effects of soil factors on Rs and spatial non-stationarity were considered simultaneously, the relationship between plant diversity and Rs changed in magnitude and direction. From the river bank to the desert margin, the positive effect of taxonomic and functional diversity on Rs gradually weakened, while the effect of phylogenetic diversity on Rs changed from a negative to a positive effect. Plant diversity and soil factors together explained 55%-75% of the spatial variation in Rs. Among them, the contribution of plant diversity to the spatial variation of Rs gradually decreased from the river bank to the desert margin, while the contribution of soil factors gradually increased. Functional diversity (17.39%-18.93%) and phylogenetic diversity (10.75%-19.53%) better explained the spatial variability of Rs compared with taxonomic diversity (2.67%-6.01%). The results provide strong evidence that plant diversity, especially functional and phylogenetic diversity, is a key driver of Rs, expanding our understanding of the relationship between plant diversity and Rs. These findings more accurately reveal the changing characteristics of carbon dynamics in desert ecosystems, and provide a methodological framework for studying the spatial variability of the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem function.","[Wang, Jinlong; He, Xuemin; Li, Zhoukang; Chen, Yudong; Li, Wenjing; Wang, Shiyun; Liu, Feiyi; Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinlong; He, Xuemin; Li, Zhoukang; Chen, Yudong; Li, Wenjing; Wang, Shiyun; Liu, Feiyi; Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Educ Minist, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jinlong; He, Xuemin; Li, Zhoukang; Chen, Yudong; Li, Wenjing; Wang, Shiyun; Liu, Feiyi; Lv, Guanghui] Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Deser, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Teng, Dexiong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang 110000, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wen] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Geog & Remote Sensing Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Educ Minist, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, 666 Shengli Rd, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China","Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University","Lv, GH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Educ Minist, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, 666 Shengli Rd, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",ler@xju.edu.cn,,"Teng, Dexiong/0000-0001-8742-230X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760168, 31560131]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region university scientific research project [XJEDU2020I002]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction Project-Science and Technology Innovation Base Construction Project [PT2107]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project [XJ2020G012, XJ2019G020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region university scientific research project; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction Project-Science and Technology Innovation Base Construction Project; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project,"This research was jointly funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31760168 and 31560131) , Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region university scientific research project (XJEDU2020I002) , Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction Project-Science and Technology Innovation Base Construction Project (PT2107) , and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project (XJ2020G012 and XJ2019G020) .

Mixed-species forests have often been shown to enhance above-ground ecosystem properties and processes. Despite the significance of fine roots for tree and ecosystem functioning, the role of tree species diversity for below-ground processes driven by fine roots remains largely unknown. Previously, an underyielding of fine-root biomass (FRB) in tree mixtures across four major European forest types has been reported. To explain this phenomenon, we tested here the effect of tree species mixing on fine-root traits related to soil exploitation efficiency, including biotic feedbacks from ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM), and assessed the role of root trait dissimilarity. 2. We analysed morphological and chemical traits as well as ectomycorrhizal colonisation intensity of absorptive fine roots (i.e. first three most distal orders) in soil samples from 315 mixed and mono-specific tree neighbourhoods in mainly mature, semi-natural forest stands across Europe. Additionally, we quantified mycorrhizal abundance and diversity in soil samples from the same stands. 3. At the community level, fine roots in tree mixtures were characterised by higher specific root lengths and root nitrogen concentrations, lower diameters and root tissue densities indicating a faster resource acquisition strategy compared to mono-specific stands. The higher root EcM colonisation intensity and soil EcM diversity in mixtures compared to mono-specific stands may further provide evidence for positive biotic feedbacks. Moreover, the diversity of fine-root traits influenced FRB, as mixtures characterised by a higher trait dissimilarity were linked to a lower reduction in FRB. At the level of phylogenetic groups, thin-rooted angiosperm species showed stronger responses to mixing than thick-rooted gymnosperms, especially in terms of root morphology and EcM colonisation, indicating different strategies of response to tree mixing. 4. Our results indicate that a lower FRB can reflect a shift in soil resource acquisition strategies, rather than a lower performance of trees in mixtures. They show that several non-exclusive mechanisms can simultaneously explain negative net effects of mixing on FRB. This study sheds new light on the importance of using integrative approaches including both above-and below-ground biomass and traits to study diversity effects on plant productivity.","[Wambsganss, Janna; Beyer, Friderike; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany; [Freschet, Gregoire T.] Univ Toulouse III, CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, Moulis, France; [Goldmann, Kezia; Prada-Salcedo, Luis Daniel] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Ecol, Halle, Germany; [Wambsganss, Janna; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Freiburg,"Wambsganss, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany.;Wambsganss, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany.",janna.wambsganss@gmail.com,"Wambsganss, Janna/AAY-2148-2021; Bauhus, Jürgen/G-4449-2013; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; Beyer, Friderike/M-1108-2013","Wambsganss, Janna/0000-0002-2968-558X; Bauhus, Jürgen/0000-0002-9673-4986; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Beyer, Friderike/0000-0002-3597-5022; Prada-Salcedo, Luis Daniel/0000-0001-8403-7094; Goldmann, Kezia/0000-0003-2954-5517","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Belgian Science Policy Office; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BA 2821/16-1 SCHE 695/10-1]; Research Foundation Flanders; Swedish Research Council; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; European Social Fund","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF))","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Belgian Science Policy Office; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: BA 2821/16-1 SCHE 695/10-1; Research Foundation Flanders; The Swedish Research Council; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden--Wurttemberg; European Social Fund",NA,110,9,9,21,94,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

However, this effect may be related to the ecological differentiation between coexisting species, often expressed as either functional diversity (FD; diversity in traits) or phylogenetic diversity (PD; diversity in phylogenetic ancestry) within plant communities. Evidence for the independent and combined role of FD and PD on ecosystem functions is generally missing, as measures of FD and PD are usually confounded in empirical studies. Methods To solve this challenge we used an ad-hoc designed biodiversity experiment, with sown meadow plant communities forming independent combinations of FD and PD (low/low, low/high, high/low, high/high values, plus monocultures) and used ion-exchange membranes to monitor changes in soil N (i.e. NH4+-N and NO3--N) availability through time (four sampling times per year; i.e. seasonality). Results Our results showed a positive diversity effect for soil NH4+-N, with mixture communities yielding higher levels of NH4+-N than the corresponding monocultures. Within mixtures, communities with combinations of both high FD and PD showed the highest NH4+-N availability. Most importantly, although seasonality strongly affected soil N availability, diversity effects were generally consistent through time in the case of NH4+-N. In addition to these diversity effects, communities with higher proportion of nitrogen-fixing species also showed higher soil N availability. Conclusions Plant communities composed of species with larger ecological differences can sustain high levels of available NH4+-N throughout the year, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition processes via the coexistence of plants with multiple strategies.","[Valencia, Enrique] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Experimentales & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Mostoles, Spain; [de Bello, Francesco; Galland, Thomas; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [de Bello, Francesco] Ctr Invest Desertificac CSIC UV GV, Valencia, Spain; [Galland, Thomas; Gotzenberger, Lars] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Trebon, Czech Republic; [Leps, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Res Ctr, Inst Entomol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Duran, Jorge] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal; [Carmona, Carlos P.] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Tartu, Estonia",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Universidade de Coimbra; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences,"Valencia, E (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Experimentales & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Mostoles, Spain.",valencia.gomez.e@gmail.com,"de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; Duran, Jorge/AFN-5619-2022; Valencia, Enrique/AAR-1438-2021; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; Duran, Jorge/0000-0002-7375-5290; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429","British Ecological Society [SR16/1364]; Young Researchers R&D Project - Community of Madrid [M2165]; Rey Juan Carlos University; Czech Science Foundation [GA16-15012]; 2017 program for attracting and retaining talent of Comunidad de Madrid [2017-T2/AMB-5406]; Estonian Research Council [PSG293]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [IF/00950/2014, 2020.03670.CEECIND]; R&D Unit Center for Functional Ecology -Science for People and the Planet (CFE) - FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC) [UIDB/04004/2020]",British Ecological Society; Young Researchers R&D Project - Community of Madrid; Rey Juan Carlos University; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); 2017 program for attracting and retaining talent of Comunidad de Madrid; Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); R&D Unit Center for Functional Ecology -Science for People and the Planet (CFE) - FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC),"We thank all people involved in the maintenance of the experiment.

We investigated the effects of multiple facets of biodiversity - species richness and composition of the community, and intraspecific diversity in two key species - on both production and resistance of experimentally-assembled biological soil crusts (biocrusts). We found that productivity was most strongly influenced by community composition (variation in the presence and relative proportions of community members), and weakly positively influenced by species richness. Intraspecific diversity, encompassing both the richness and composition of clones, had a neutral effect on community productivity within one focal species (Syntrichia caninervis), but a moderately negative effect on productivity within the other focal species (S. ruralis). Resistance was also most strongly influenced by community composition, although different sets of species contributed most to resistance and production. Resistance was not affected by either species richness or intraspecific diversity in either focal species. Our findings supported our general expectation that community-level facets of biodiversity would be more influential than intraspecific diversity within a species because trait variability among species is usually greater than that within. These results also indicated that although species richness is often thought to strongly affect both productivity and resistance, the presence, absence and relative abundance of particular species may be more influential to both. Simultaneous manipulation of multiple facets of biodiversity in experiments may lead to a more complete understanding of the variety of ways in which biodiversity may regulate ecological systems.","[Bowker, Matthew A.; Rengifo-Faiffer, M.

Through their functional traits and interactions with both abiotic and biotic environment, they also significantly affect the process of open land colonization by trees as well as vegetation succession coupled with soil and ecosystem development. Here we review the role of ECM fungi in the early primary and secondary succession following major anthropogenic disturbances. Based on the examples of mine spoils and post-agricultural lands, we demonstrate key ecosystem services provided by ECM fungi in the processes of forest restoration. We point out ecological mechanisms and adaptations which underpin ECM fungal community successional interactions, particularly life histories, dispersal, spatial structure, host preferences, and sensitivity to environmental filters. We emphasize the need of better understanding the role of ECM fungi in the forest restoration practice as it seems crucial for afforestation success and biodiversity rehabilitation. Thus, ectomycorrhizal traits should be a prime consideration in afforestation and carbon sequestration polices, sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation practices.","[Kalucka, Izabela L.] Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Algol & Mycol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Dendrol, Parkowa 5, PL-62035 Kornik, Poland; [Jagodzinski, Andrzej M.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Forestry, Dept Game Management & Forest Protect, Wojska Polskiego 71c, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland",University of Lodz; Polish Academy of Sciences; Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kalucka, IL (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Algol & Mycol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",ikalucka@biol.uni.lodz.pl; amj@man.poznan.pl,"Kalucka, Izabela L/F-7331-2012; Jagodzi?ski, Andrzej M./AAA-2537-2021","Kalucka, Izabela L/0000-0002-7264-5735; Jagodzi?ski, Andrzej M./0000-0001-6899-0985","Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Warsaw, Poland [3 P04G 031 23, N N305 2996 40]; General Directorate of State Forests, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland","Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Warsaw, Poland(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); General Directorate of State Forests, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland","This review was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Warsaw, Poland (grant nos. 3 P04G 031 23 and N N305 2996 40), by the General Directorate of State Forests, Warsaw, Poland (research project 'Environmental and genetic factors affecting productivity of forest ecosystems on forest and post-industrial habitats') and by the Institute of Dendrology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kornik, Poland.

How observations are used to constrain parameters has a direct impact on the carbon cycle dynamics simulated by ecosystem models. In this study, we present an evaluation of several options for the use of observations in modeling regional carbon dynamics and explore the implications of those options. We calibrated the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model on a hierarchy of three vegetation classification levels for the Alaskan boreal forest: species level, plant-functional-type level (PFT level), and biome level, and we examined the differences in simulated carbon dynamics. Species-specific field-based estimates were directly used to parameterize the model for species-level simulations, while weighted averages based on species percent cover were used to generate estimates for PFT- and biome-level model parameterization. We found that calibrated key ecosystem process parameters differed substantially among species and overlapped for species that are categorized into different PFTs. Our analysis of parameter sets suggests that the PFT-level parameterizations primarily reflected the dominant species and that functional information of some species were lost from the PFT-level parameterizations. The biome-level parameterization was primarily representative of the needleleaf PFT and lost information on broadleaf species or PFT function. Our results indicate that PFT-level simulations may be potentially representative of the performance of species-level simulations while biome-level simulations may result in biased estimates. Improved theoretical and empirical justifications for grouping species into PFTs or biomes are needed to adequately represent the dynamics of ecosystem functioning and structure.","[He, Yujie; Zhuang, Qianlai; Liu, Yaling; Chen, Min] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zhuang, Qianlai] Purdue Univ, Dept Agron, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McGuire, A.

In this study, we examined the community stability of a tropical montane forest in China over 10 years to explore the effect of multiple facets of biodiversity (that is, taxonomic, functional, and structural diversity). We further tested the relative importance of biodiversity, functional traits, species asynchrony, species stability, and abiotic factors (that is, soil nutrients) on community stability. We found that multiple facets of biodiversity had inconsistent effects on stability, including a neutral effect of species richness, and weak positive effects of functional diversity and structural diversity. Species asynchrony, rather than biodiversity, was the greatest predictor of community stability, followed by the stability of large trees. Consistent with the mass-ratio hypothesis, the stability of dominant species also had an important direct effect on community stability. Although functional trait composition had no direct effect on stability, it regulated stability via species asynchrony, large tree stability, and dominant species stability. Similarly, soil nutrients conferred minor effects on community stability. Our results indicated that the insurance effect is the main mechanism driving community stability in this subtropical forest. Meanwhile, the mass-ratio hypothesis also played an important role, which suggested that the management and protection of forest ecosystem should not only focus on biodiversity but also the community structural attributes.","[Zhou, Tianyang; Qin, Yuanzhi; Zhou, Gang; Wang, Congrong; Xu, Yaozhan; Fei, Yanan; Qiao, Xiujuan; Jiang, Mingxi] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tianyang; Qin, Yuanzhi; Zhou, Gang; Wang, Congrong; Xu, Yaozhan; Fei, Yanan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiaxin] Jiangxi Prov & Chinese Acad Sci, Lushan Bot Garden, Jiujiang 332900, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Xiujuan; Jiang, Mingxi] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Core Bot Gardens, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Qiao, XJ; Jiang, MX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Qiao, XJ; Jiang, MX (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Core Bot Gardens, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",xjqiao@wbgcas.cn; mxjiang@wbgcas.cn,"Qiao, xiujuan/M-6966-2013; Jiang, Mingxi/E-6344-2017","Qiao, xiujuan/0000-0003-4647-399X; Jiang, Mingxi/0000-0002-9719-3093","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32171536, 31670441]; China Scholarship Council [202104910379]; Chinese Forest Biodiversity Monitoring Network (CForBio)",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Chinese Forest Biodiversity Monitoring Network (CForBio),"This work was financially supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB31000000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (32171536 and 31670441) and China Scholarship Council (202104910379).

Bryophytes are abundant in boreal forests, thus changes in moss community composition and functional traits (for example, moisture and nutrient content; rates of photosynthesis and respiration) may have important consequences for ecosystem processes and microfaunal communities. Through synthesis of previous work and new analyses integrating new and published data from a long-term successional gradient in the boreal forest of northern Sweden, we provide a comprehensive view of the biotic factors (for example, vascular plant productivity, species composition, and diversity) and abiotic factors (for example, soil fertility and light transmission) that impact the moss community. Our results show that different aspects of the moss community (that is, composition, functional traits, moss-driven processes, and associated invertebrate fauna) respond to different sets of environmental variables, and that these are not always the same variables as those that influence the vascular plant community. Measures of moss community composition and functional traits were primarily influenced by vascular plant community composition and productivity. This suggests that successional shifts in abiotic variables, such as soil nutrient levels, indirectly affect the moss community via their influence on vascular plant community characteristics, whereas direct abiotic effects are less important. Among the moss-driven processes, moss litter decomposition and moss productivity were mainly influenced by biotic variables (notably the community characteristics of both vascular plants and mosses), whereas moss functional traits (primarily specific leaf area and tissue nutrient concentrations) also were important in explaining moss di-nitrogen-fixation rates. In contrast, both abiotic and biotic variables were important drivers of moss microfaunal community structure. Taken together, our results show which abiotic and biotic factors impact mosses and their associated organisms, and thus highlight that multiple interacting factors need to be considered to understand how moss communities, associated food webs, and the ecosystem processes they influence will respond to environmental change.","[Jonsson, Micael] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Kardol, Paul; Gundale, Michael J.; Bansal, Sheel; Nilsson, Marie-Charlotte; Metcalfe, Daniel B.; Wardle, David A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Bansal, Sheel] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific NW Res Stn, Olympia Forestry Sci Lab, Olympia, WA 98512 USA; [Metcalfe, Daniel B.] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Lund University,"Jonsson, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",micael.jonsson@emg.umu.se,"Gundale, Michael J/O-1265-2013; Kardol, Paul/N-8383-2015; Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/B-1802-2017; Jonsson, Micael/E-6839-2012","Gundale, Michael J/0000-0003-2447-609X; Kardol, Paul/0000-0001-7065-3435; Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335; Hegethorn, Marie-Charlotte Nilsson/0000-0002-9254-2223; Bansal, Sheel/0000-0003-1233-1707",Swedish Research Councils Formas; Vetenskapsradet; Wallenberg Scholars award,Swedish Research Councils Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Wallenberg Scholars award,"We thank a great number of field assistants-too many to list here-that over the years have helped out on the islands.

We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (biomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8-16years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity-biomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity-biomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with biomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.","[Lasky, Jesse R.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lasky, Jesse R.; Uriarte, Maria] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Boukili, Vanessa K.; Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Erickson, David L.; Kress, W.

We used community-weighted mean of wood density and maximum stem diameter to evaluate the effect of functional dominance in AGC stock. We found that different topographic conditions and stand age change community composition, richness, abundance and CD species along the late-secondary stage. Our results showed that functional trait values of CD species determine AGC stock. Thus, the proportion of CD species was shaped by topography and stand age, whereas carbon stock by the dominant species' functional traits (wood density and diameter).

Variation within a species is increasingly acknowledged to have substantial ecological consequences, particularly through trophic cascades. We hypothesized that the intraspecific genotypic variation of the tree host might impact the phylogenetic composition of its rhizospheric microbial communities, by favouring particular clades, that might be further reflected in ecosystem process rates. We tested whether the intraspecific genotypic variation of Pinus pinaster modulates nutrient cycling by determining the phylogenetic structure of its symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi and rhizospheric bacteria. We sequenced fungal and bacterial molecular markers and reconstructed phylogenies in the rhizosphere of P. pinaster trees belonging to three genotypic variants (Mediterranean, Atlantic, African) in three 45-year-old common garden experiments, and measured seven soil enzymatic activities. Local effects, based on differences in elevation and soil conditions across sites, were strong predictors of the ectomycorrhizal and bacterial communities thriving in tree's rhizosphere. Across-site variation also explained differences in phosphorus cycling. We detected, however, a significant effect of the plant genotype on the phylogenetic structure of the root-associated microbiota that was consistent across sites. The most productive Mediterranean plant genotype sheltered the most distinct root microbiome, with the dominant Basidiomycetes and Proteobacteria having a strong influence on the phylogenetic microbial community structure and associating with an enhanced hydrolysis of celluloses, hemicelluloses and chitin. Beneath the less productive Atlantic genotype, the less abundant Ascomycetes and up to thirteen bacterial phyla shaped the phylogenetic microbial structure, and predicted the rates of peptidase. Ectomycorrhizal fungi explained the activity of cellulases and protease, and bacteria that of hemicellulases and chitinase, suggesting functional complementarity. Synthesis. This is the first report using three-replicated long-term common gardens in mature forests to disentangle plant genotype- and site-specific drivers of the rhizospheric microbiome and its enzymatic potential. We concluded that intraspecific variation in primary producers leaves a phylogenetic signature in mutualists and decomposers that further modulate key steps in carbon and nitrogen cycles. These results emphasize the ecological relevance of plant intraspecific diversity in determining essential plant-soil feedbacks that control ecosystem productivity and performance.","[Perez-Izquierdo, Leticia; Zabal-Aguirre, Mario; Rincon, Ana] CSIC, ICA, Madrid, Spain; [Gonzalez-Martinez, Santiago C.] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO, INRA, Cestas, France; [Buee, Marc] Univ Lorraine, INRA, IAM, UMR1136, Nancy, France; [Verdu, Miguel; Goberna, Marta] GV, UV, CSIC, CIDE, Moncada, Spain; [Goberna, Marta] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Izquierdo, Leticia] SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Agrarias (ICA); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE; Universite de Lorraine; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Valencia; CSIC-GV-UV - Centro de Investigaciones sobre Desertificacion (CIDE); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Perez-Izquierdo, L (corresponding author), CSIC, ICA, Madrid, Spain.;Perez-Izquierdo, L (corresponding author), SLU, Dept Soil & Environm, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",leticia.perez@slu.se,"Izquierdo, Leticia Pérez/AAA-9760-2020; Verdu, Miguel/C-4461-2008; Zabal-Aguirre, Mario/A-1410-2011; Goberna, Marta/A-9183-2012; Rincon, Ana/H-1295-2015","Izquierdo, Leticia Pérez/0000-0002-5200-8157; Verdu, Miguel/0000-0002-9778-7692; Zabal-Aguirre, Mario/0000-0002-7237-0954; Goberna, Marta/0000-0001-5303-3429; Rincon, Ana/0000-0001-6754-4609; Buee, Marc/0000-0001-8614-3886","Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [CGL2011-29585-C02-02, CGL2014-58333-P]; LABoratoire d'EXcellence Arbre",Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government); LABoratoire d'EXcellence Arbre,"Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), Grant/Award Number: CGL2011-29585-C02-02 and CGL2014-58333-P; LABoratoire d'EXcellence Arbre",NA,87,49,50,12,154,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Intercropping is generally implemented using commercial seeds that were bred for maximal productivity in monocultures, thereby ignoring the ability of plants to adapt over generations to the surrounding neighbourhood, notably through increased complementarity, that is reduced competition or increased facilitation. This is why using monoculture-adapted seeds for intercropping might limit the benefits of crop diversity on yield. However, the adaptation potential of crops and the corresponding changes in complementarity have not been explored in annual crop systems. Here we show that plant-plant interactions among annual crops shifted towards reduced competition and/or increased facilitation when the plants were growing in the same community type as their parents did in the previous two generations. Total yield did not respond to this common coexistence history, but in fertilized conditions, we observed increased overyielding in mixtures with a common coexistence history. Surprisingly, we observed character convergence between species sharing the same coexistence history for two generations, in monocultures but also in mixtures: the six crop species tested converged towards taller phenotypes with lower leaf dry matter content. This study provides the first empirical evidence for the potential of parental diversity affecting plant-plant interactions, species complementarity and therefore potentially ecosystem functioning of the following generations in annual cropping systems. Although further studies are required to assess the context-dependence of these results, our findings may still have important implications for diversified agriculture as they illustrate the potential of targeted cultivars to increase complementarity of species in intercropping, which could be achieved through specific breeding for mixtures.","[Stefan, Laura; Engbersen, Nadine; Schob, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Stefan, Laura] Agroscope, Plant Prod Syst, Nyon, Switzerland; [Schob, Christian] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Mostoles, Spain",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Stefan, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Stefan, L (corresponding author), Agroscope, Plant Prod Syst, Nyon, Switzerland.",laura.stefan@m4x.org,"Stefan, Laura/HKW-4236-2023; Schöb, Christian/B-6083-2008","Stefan, Laura/0000-0003-0798-9782; Schöb, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286",Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3_170645],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),Swiss National Science Foundation PP00P3_170645 Christian Schob,NA,98,3,3,5,8,eLIFE SCIENCES PUBL LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,SEP 13,2022,11,,,NA,,NA,,,e77577,10.7554/eLife.77577,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.77577,NA,,22,Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,5I9XW,36097813,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000868703400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies carried out predominantly in terrestrial grassland and soil ecosystems have demonstrated that as the number of species in assembled communities increases, so too do certain ecosystem processes, such as productivity, whereas others such as decomposition can remain unaffected(12). Diversity can influence aspects of ecosystem function, but questions remain as to how generic the patterns observed are, and whether they are the product of diversity, as such, or of the functional roles and traits that characterize species in ecological systems. Here we demonstrate variable diversity effects for species representative of marine coastal systems at both global and regional scales. We provide evidence for an increase in complementary resource use as diversity increases and show strong evidence for diversity effects in naturally assembled com-munities at a regional scale. The variability among individual species responses is consistent with a positive but idiosyncratic pattern of ecosystem function with increased diversity.","Univ Aberdeen, Culterty Field Stn, Newburgh AB41 6AA, Ellon, Scotland; Univ St Andrews, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of St Andrews,"Emmerson, MC (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Culterty Field Stn, Newburgh AB41 6AA, Ellon, Scotland.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012; Paterson, David M/D-5202-2013; Solan, Martin/E-9338-2012; Emmerson, Mark Charles/ABD-6274-2021","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833; Paterson, David M/0000-0003-1174-6476; Solan, Martin/0000-0001-9924-5574; Emmerson, Mark/0000-0003-1034-8572",,,,NA,25,235,243,0,75,MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LTD,LONDON,"PORTERS SOUTH, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,MAY 3,2001,411,6833,,NA,,NA,73,77,,10.1038/35075055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35075055,NA,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,427XY,11333979,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000168432800045,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimates of carbon and nutrient allocation to build and maintain these structures remain uncertain because of the challenges of consistently measuring and interpreting fine-root systems. Traditionally, fine roots have been defined as all roots 2mm in diameter, yet it is now recognized that this approach fails to capture the diversity of form and function observed among fine-root orders. Here, we demonstrate how order-based and functional classification frameworks improve our understanding of dynamic root processes in ecosystems dominated by perennial plants. In these frameworks, fine roots are either separated into individual root orders or functionally defined into a shorter-lived absorptive pool and a longer-lived transport fine-root pool. Using these frameworks, we estimate that fine-root production and turnover represent 22% of terrestrial net primary production globally - a c. 30% reduction from previous estimates assuming a single fine-root pool. Future work developing tools to rapidly differentiate functional fine-root classes, explicit incorporation of mycorrhizal fungi into fine-root studies, and wider adoption of a two-pool approach to model fine roots provide opportunities to better understand below-ground processes in the terrestrial biosphere.","[McCormack, M.

Drought has already led to declines in functionally important tree species, which are documented in dieback events, shifts in species distributions, local extinctions, and compromised ecosystem function. Understanding whether tree species possess the capacity to adapt to future drought conditions is a major conservation challenge. In this study, we assess the capacity of a functionally important plant species from south-eastern Australia (Banksia marginata, Proteaceae) to adapt to water-limited environments. A water-manipulated common garden experiment was used to test for phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation in seedlings sourced from seven provenances of contrasting climate-origins (wet and dry). We found evidence of local adaptation relating to plant growth investment strategies with populations from drier climate-origins showing greater growth in well-watered conditions. The results also revealed that environment drives variation in physiological (stomatal conductance, predawn and midday water potential) and structural traits (wood density, leaf dry matter content). Finally, these results indicate that traits are coordinated to optimize conservation of water under water-limited conditions and that trait coordination (phenotypic integration) does not constrain phenotypic plasticity.

It is frequently assumed that a species responds uniformly across its range to climate change. However, ecotypes - locally adapted populations within a species - display differences in traits that may affect their gross primary productivity (GPP) and response to climate change. To determine if ecotypes are important for understanding the response of ecosystem productivity to climate we measured and modeled growing season GPP in reciprocally transplanted and experimentally warmed ecotypes of the abundant Arctic sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. Transplanted northern ecotypes displayed home-site advantage in GPP that was associated with differences in leaf area index. Southern ecotypes exhibited a greater response in GPP when transplanted. The results demonstrate that ecotypic differentiation can impact the morphology and function of vegetation with implications for carbon cycling. Moreover they suggest that ecotypic control of GPP may limit the response of ecosystem productivity to climate change. This investigation shows that ecotypes play a substantial role in determining GPP and its response to climate. These results have implications for understanding annual to decadal carbon cycling where ecotypes could influence ecosystem function and vegetation feedbacks to climate change.","[Curasi, Salvatore R.; Rocha, Adrian V.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, South Bend, IN 46556 USA; [Parker, Thomas C.; Tang, Jianwu] Marine Biol Lab, Ecosyst Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Parker, Thomas C.] Univ Stirling, Sch Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Moody, Michael L.] Univ Texas El Paso, Biol Sci, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Fetcher, Ned] Wilkes Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Sustainabil, Wilkes Barre, PA 18766 USA",University of Notre Dame; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole; University of Stirling; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; Wilkes University,"Curasi, SR (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, South Bend, IN 46556 USA.",scurasi@nd.edu,"Parker, Thomas/GNP-1839-2022; Curasi, Salvatore/AAC-1647-2019; Fetcher, Ned/ABE-9438-2020; Moody, Michael/J-8997-2012","Curasi, Salvatore/0000-0002-4534-3344; Fetcher, Ned/0000-0003-2604-299X; Moody, Michael/0000-0003-0327-267X","National Science Foundation [NSF/PLR 1418010, NSF/PLR 1417645, NSF/PLR 1417763, DEB 1556772]; Arctic LTER [NSF/PLR 1637459]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Arctic LTER,"Thanks to Steve Unger and Alana Thurston for field assistance.

Compared to numbers of studies focusing on above-ground vegetation, the response of below-ground communities to abiotic stresses along plant diversity gradients is often ignored and is considered an important knowledge gap in ecosystem ecology. Here we conducted an integrative research to evaluate the resistance of plant biomass, and soil microbial communities and associated functional profiles to drought under varying plant diversity. We carried out a 3-year manipulation experiment by factorially controlling plant diversity gradient (1, 2, 4 and 8 species richness) and soil moisture treatment (drought and non-drought), and investigated the responses of plant biomass, soil bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition, soil glomalin, and five key soil enzymes. We found that plant diversity significantly improved the resistance of soil fungal communities and microbial functional profiles characterized by soil glomalin and five key enzymes, which was partly driven by the availability and accessibility of soil resources (e.g. soil moisture and organic matter) mediated by plant diversity. Furthermore, our results indicated that the enhanced resistance of fungal communities was consistent with ecological insurance theory that diverse fungal communities at high plant diversity had a higher probability of containing taxa that adapt to drought. Synthesis. Our study provides novel empirical insights into the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of plant diversity on resistance of above-ground vegetation and below-ground biota to drought, with implications for understanding ecosystem response to climate change and improving biodiversity conservation practices.","[Li, Yan; Shen, Congcong; Wang, Jichen; Ge, Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan; Shen, Congcong; Wang, Jichen; Ge, Yuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiang] Taizhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taizhou, Peoples R China; [Singh, Brajesh K.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Singh, Brajesh K.] Western Sydney Univ, Global Ctr Land Based Innovat, Penrith, NSW, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Taizhou University; Western Sydney University; Western Sydney University","Ge, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Ge, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuange@rcees.ac.cn,"Singh, Brajesh/R-6321-2019; Ge, Yuan/D-2997-2009","Singh, Brajesh/0000-0003-4413-4185; Ge, Yuan/0000-0003-0234-5638; Li, Yan/0000-0002-5526-7066; Shen, Congcong/0000-0002-3452-6049","Australian Research Council [DP210102081]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870504, 42177274]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program [2019QZKK0306, 2019QZKK0308]; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology [SKLURE2022-1-3]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology,"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP210102081; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/ Award Number: 31870504 and 42177274; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program, Grant/ Award Number: 2019QZKK0306 and 2019QZKK0308; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Grant/Award Number: SKLURE2022-1-3",NA,107,3,3,61,138,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

However, the specific mechanisms affecting biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (BEMF) relationships in forests are largely unknown. This is particularly evident for the macroscale of a large forested landscape. Methods: Based on 412 one-tenth hectare field plots distributed over forested areas across northeastern China, we evaluated three alternative hypotheses explaining the relationships between BEMF, namely: niche complementarity, mass ratio, and vegetation quantity effect. We used Rao's quadratic entropy and community weighted mean trait values to quantify forest biodiversity. These two variables represent two complementary aspects of functional properties, which are in line with niche complementary and mass ratio effects, respectively. Results: Ecosystem multifunctionality was negatively associated with the community weighted mean values of acquisitive traits (a proxy of mass ratio effect). Rao's quadratic entropy (a proxy of niche complementarity) had no relationship with ecosystem multifunctionality. Higher stand biomass greatly increased ecosystem multifunctionality, which is in line with the vegetation quantity effect. Our results confirm that in the temperate forests of northeastern China, the relationship of BEMF was primarily affected by vegetation quantity, followed by mass ratio effects. Conclusions: The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of the main drivers of ecosystem multifunctionality in forest ecosystems. The results of this study provide additional evidence to support the vegetation quantity and mass ratio hypotheses in forest ecosystems.","[Yue, Qingmin; Hao, Minhui; Geng, Yan; Wang, Xuerui; Zhang, Chunyu; Zhao, Xiuhai; Gao, Lushuang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn State Forestry & G, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [von Gadow, Klaus] Georg August Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [von Gadow, Klaus] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac AgriSci, ZA-7600 Matieland, South Africa",Beijing Forestry University; University of Gottingen; Stellenbosch University,"Gao, LS (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Res Ctr Forest Management Engn State Forestry & G, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",gaolushuang@bjfu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Chun-yu/HDP-5776-2022; wenjun, wang/HGB-6118-2022; Zhang, Chunyu/GYA-2925-2022","wenjun, wang/0000-0002-9886-694X; Zhang, Chunyu/0000-0003-3091-5060",Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [31971650]; Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan [2017YFC0504005]; Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China [31800362],Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan; Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31971650) , the Key Project of National Key Research and Development Plan (No. 2017YFC0504005) , and the Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31800362) .",NA,61,0,0,18,41,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, Building 5, Room 411, BEIJING, DONGCHENG DISTRICT 100009, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-6355,2197-5620,,FOR ECOSYST,For.

In this study we explored the effects of the invasion by the two filamentous red algae Heterosiphonia japonica and Bonnemaisonia hamifera on the primary production of seaweed communities by using single and mixed cultures of non-native and native red algae. The experiments were conducted both in the presence and absence of herbivores. Biomass production of the invaded community increased more than four times in mixed cultures with H. japonica, while introduction by B. hamifera had no significant effect. The different impact on community production could be explained by differences in life history strategies between the invaders; H. japonica grew considerably faster than the native seaweeds which directly increased the community production, while B. hamifera showed a relatively slow growth rate and therefore had no effect. From previous studies it is known that B. hamifera produces a highly deterrent, but also costly, chemical defence. The assessment of survival and growth of a native generalist herbivore further corroborated that the biomass produced by B. hamifera constitutes a very low-quality food, whereas the performance of herbivores on a diet of H. japonica was comparable to that on native algal diets. In summary, this study demonstrates that successful invaders belonging to the same functional group (filamentous red algae) may have distinctly different impacts on productivity in the recipient community, depending on their specific life history traits.","[Sagerman, Josefin; Wikstrom, Sofia A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Enge, Swantje; Pavia, Henrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci Tjarno, S-45296 Stromstad, Sweden; [Wikstrom, Sofia A.] AquaBiota Water Res, S-11550 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; University of Gothenburg,"Sagerman, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",josefin.sagerman@su.se,"Wikström, Sofia/Y-6453-2019","Wikström, Sofia/0000-0003-3508-2109; Enge, Swantje/0000-0003-4292-0051",Swedish Research Council Formas [217-2007-534]; Linnaeus grant from the Swedish Research Council VR [621-2011-5630],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Linnaeus grant from the Swedish Research Council VR,"We thank G.

We conducted a glasshouse experiment in which three plant species of each of three functional groups (grasses, N-fixing legumes and forbs) were grown in monoculture and in mixtures of three species (with the three species being in the same or different functional groups) and all nine species. Plant species identity had important effects on the biomasses or population densities of belowground primary consumers (microbial biomass, herbivorous nematodes) and two groups of secondary consumers (microbe-feeding nematodes and enchytraeids); the third consumer trophic level (predatory nematodes) was marginally not significantly affected at P = 0.05. Plant species also influenced the relative importance of the bacterial-based and fungal-based energy channels for both the primary and secondary consumer trophic levels. Within-group diversity of only the soil microflora and herbivorous nematodes (both representing the basal consumer trophic level) were affected by plant species identity. However, community composition within all trophic groupings considered (herbivorous nematodes, microbes, microbe-feeding nematodes, predatory nematodes) was strongly influenced by what plant species were present. Despite the strong responses of the soil biota to plant species identity, there were few effects of plant species or functional group richness on any of the belowground response variables measured. Further, net primary productivity (NPP) was unaffected by plant diversity. Since some belowground response variables were correlated with NPP across treatments, it is suggested that belowground responses to plant diversity might become more apparent in situations when NIPP itself responds to plant diversity. Our results point to plant species identity as having important multitrophic effects on soil food webs, both at the whole trophic group and within-group levels of resolution, and suggest that differences in plant traits across species may be important in driving the decomposer subsystem.","Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Vegetat Ecol, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Landcare Res, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Landcare Research - New Zealand; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Landcare Research - New Zealand,"Wardle, DA (corresponding author), Landcare Res, POB 69, Lincoln, New Zealand.",david.wardle@svek.slu.se,"Wardle, David A./F-6031-2011","Wardle, David A./0000-0002-0476-7335",,,,NA,57,167,182,5,155,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2003,102,1,,NA,,NA,45,56,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12481.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12481.x,NA,,12,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,693BD,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000183694000005,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a key plant functional trait that is widely used in Earth System Models for simulation of the global carbon and water cycles. Measuring V-cmax is time-consuming and laborious; therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution of V-cmax is still poorly understood due to limited measurements of V-cmax. In this study, we used a data assimilation approach to map the spatial variation of V-cmax for global terrestrial ecosystems from a 11-year-long satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) record. In this SIF-derived V-cmax map, the mean V-cmax value for each plant function type (PFT) is found to be comparable to a widely used N-derived V-cmax dataset by Kattge et al. (2009). The gradient of V-cmax along PFTs is clearly revealed even without land cover information as an input. Large seasonal and spatial variations of V-cmax are found within each PFT, especially for diverse crop rotation systems. The distribution of major crop belts, characterized with high V-cmax values, is highlighted in this V-cmax map. Legume plants are characterized with high V-cmax values. This V-cmax map also clearly illustrates the emerging soybean revolution in South America where V-cmax is the highest among the world. The gradient of V-cmax in Amazon is found to follow the transition of soil types with different soil N and P contents. This study suggests that satellite-observed SIF is powerful in deriving the important plant functional trait, i.e. V-cmax, for global climate change studies.","[He, Liming; Chen, Jing M.; Liu, Jane; Wang, Rong; Rogers, Cheryl] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [He, Liming] Lab Environm Model & Data Optima, Laurel, MD 20707 USA; [Chen, Jing M.] Nanjing Univ, Int Inst Earth Syst Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Ting] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Joiner, Joanna] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Chou, Shuren] Space Engn Univ, Beijing 101419, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Bin; Liu, Yang; Liu, Ronggao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, China State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","University of Toronto; Nanjing University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Aerospace Engineering University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","He, LM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Geog & Planning, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",hel@geog.utoronto.ca,"Joiner, Joanna/ABD-5430-2021; Rogers, Cheryl/C-3378-2016; Joiner, Joanna/D-6264-2012; Liu, Jane/AAU-7260-2020; Chen, Jing/AAD-4768-2020","Rogers, Cheryl/0000-0003-2792-1128; Joiner, Joanna/0000-0003-4278-1020; Liu, Jane/0000-0001-7760-2788; Chen, Jing/0000-0002-8682-1293; He, Liming/0000-0003-4010-6814; Wang, Rong/0000-0002-9895-8385","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0600202]; Canadian Space Agency [14SUSMAPTO, 17SUSOARTO]; Townsend Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison through Jet Propulsion Laboratory [1579654]; International Cooperation and Exchange Programs of National Science Foundation of China (Sino-German) [41761134082]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Canadian Space Agency(Canadian Space Agency); Townsend Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison through Jet Propulsion Laboratory; International Cooperation and Exchange Programs of National Science Foundation of China (Sino-German),"J.

The effects of global environmental change on plant assemblages are expected to be a factor in determining how ecosystem functions such as carbon uptake will respond. Using vegetation data from 56 Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs across Europe, we show that in these ecosystems plant species aggregate into two major clusters that are each defined by shared response to environmental conditions. Across environmental gradients, we find significant taxonomic turnover in both clusters. However, functional identity and functional redundancy of the community as a whole remain unchanged. This strongly suggests that in peat bogs, species turnover across environmental gradients is restricted to functionally similar species. Our results demonstrate that plant taxonomic and functional turnover are decoupled, which may allow these peat bogs to maintain ecosystem functioning when subject to future environmental change.","[Robroek, Bjorn J.

By calculating the functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean functional traits (CWM), and soil factors, the correlation between FD and Rs was compared using a linear regression model and a structural equation model. The results showed that (1) the CWM traits could better explain the changes of Rs than the FD, indicating that the biomass ratio hypothesis was more suitable for explaining changes in Rs in arid desert areas; and (2) the correlation between biodiversity and Rs was affected by the interaction between biological factors and environmental factors. Soil water content and species richness also affected Rs. Research on the relationship between biodiversity and Rs should examine both biotic and abiotic factors and clarify and explore various factors affecting Rs, which is of great significance to evaluate the community dynamics and variation characteristics of Rs. The study of various factors affecting Rs in this region is helpful to elucidate the process of the soil carbon cycle in arid desert areas.","[Liu, Feiyi; Wang, Jinlong; Shu, Yulin; Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Liu, Feiyi; Wang, Jinlong; Shu, Yulin; Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Educ Minist, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Liu, Feiyi; Wang, Jinlong; Shu, Yulin; Lv, Guanghui] Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Dese, Jinghe 833300, Peoples R China",Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University,"Lv, GH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China.;Lv, GH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Educ Minist, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China.;Lv, GH (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Dese, Jinghe 833300, Peoples R China.",liufeiyi0991@stu.xju.edu.cn; wangjl45@stu.xju.edu.cn; syl@stu.xju.edu.cn; guanghui_xju@sina.com,"Shu, Yulin/HME-2613-2023","Lv, Guanghui/0000-0002-2382-776X; Wang, Jinlong/0000-0002-0296-7448","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31560131]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project [XJ2021G040, XJ2019G020]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project,This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31560131); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project XJ2019G020; and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Graduate Research and Innovation Project XJ2021G040.,NA,51,0,0,5,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2022,14,8,,NA,,NA,,,4821,10.3390/su14084821,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14084821,NA,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0S2HL,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000786100600001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strength and direction of plant diversity effects on species interactions across trophic levels are less clear. For example, with respect to the interactions between herbivorous invertebrates and plants, a number of competing hypotheses have been proposed that predict either increasing or decreasing community herbivory with increasing plant species richness. We investigated foliar herbivory rates and consumed leaf biomass along an experimental grassland plant diversity gradient in year eight after establishment. The gradient ranged from one to 60 plant species and manipulated also functional group richness (from one to four functional groups-legumes, grasses, small herbs, and tall herbs) and plant community composition. Measurements in monocultures of each plant species showed that functional groups differed in the quantity and quality of herbivory damage they experienced, with legumes being more damaged than grasses or non-legume herbs. In mixed plant communities, herbivory increased with plant diversity and the presence of two key plant functional groups in mixtures had a positive (legumes) and a negative (grasses) effect on levels of herbivory. Further, plant community biomass had a strong positive impact on consumed leaf biomass, but little effect on herbivory rates. Our results contribute detailed data from a well-established biodiversity experiment to a growing body of evidence suggesting that an increase of herbivory with increasing plant diversity is the rule rather than an exception. Considering documented effects of herbivory on other ecosystem functions and the increase of herbivory with plant diversity, levels of herbivory damage might not only be a result, but also a trigger within the diversity-productivity relationship.","[Loranger, Hannah; Eggers, Till] Univ Osnabruck, Expt Ecol Grp, Dept Biol & Chem, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Weisser, Wolfgang W.; Ebeling, Anne; Meyer, Sebastian T.] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [De Luca, Enrica] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Loranger, Jessy] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R9, Canada; [Loranger, Jessy] Univ Sherbrooke, Ctr Etud Foret, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R9, Canada; [Roscher, Christiane] Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, UFZ, D-06120 Halle, Germany",University Osnabruck; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Zurich; University of Sherbrooke; University of Sherbrooke; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Meyer, ST (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Ctr Food & Life Sci, Hans von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sebastian.t.meyer@tum.de,"Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/AAH-3856-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/0000-0003-0833-1472; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 1451]; AquaDiva@ Jena project; state of Thuringia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); AquaDiva@ Jena project; state of Thuringia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"We thank Alexandra Weigelt, the gardeners and the technical staff, in particular Gerlinde Kratzsch, for their work in maintaining the field site and organizing and processing the biomass harvest.

How BEF relationships change with environments requires knowledge of the changes of functional attributes in individual species in response to environmental change. Here, we assembled experimental plant communities with different species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) and exposed them to a drought stress gradient (control, moderate and intensive drought stress). Functional redundancy decreased with increasing drought stress for a shift from selection effect to complementarity effect. In response to drought stress, species interactions shifted from competition to facilitation and the role of light-asymmetric competition in the competitive ability of species gradually decreased. Many species that are redundant under control conditions make essential contributions to biomass production under moderate and intensive drought stress conditions. Consequently, biodiversity effects should be evaluated from a predicted climate change model and redundant species should be carefully defined.","[Gao, Song; Wang, Xiaoyan; Chen, Tong; Yan, Qiaodi; Wang, Jiang; Yu, Feihai] Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Song; Wang, Xiaoyan; Chen, Tong; Yan, Qiaodi; Shen, Mengchun; Wang, Jiang; Yu, Feihai] Taizhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Taizhou, Peoples R China",Taizhou University; Taizhou University,"Wang, J (corresponding author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.;Yu, FH (corresponding author), Taizhou Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Evolutionary Ecol & C, Sch Life Sci, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.",wangjiang@tzc.edu.cn; feihaiyu@126.com,,"Yu, Fei-Hai/0000-0001-5007-1745","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870504, 41671254]; Taizhou University National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists [2017JQ005, 2019JQ005]; Basic Public Welfare Research Projects in Zhejiang Province [LGN19C150004]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY22C030001, LTY22C030004]; National Innovation Project for College Students [202010350035]; Taizhou Science and Technology Project [1801ny06, 21hba02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taizhou University National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; Basic Public Welfare Research Projects in Zhejiang Province; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Innovation Project for College Students; Taizhou Science and Technology Project,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 31870504, 41671254], Taizhou University National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists [grant numbers 2017JQ005, 2019JQ005], Basic Public Welfare Research Projects in Zhejiang Province [grant number LGN19C150004], Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [grant numbers LY22C030001, LTY22C030004], National Innovation Project for College Students (grant number 202010350035), Taizhou Science and Technology Project [grant numbers 1801ny06, 21hba02].",NA,63,0,0,24,79,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-9145,1742-9153,,J PLANT INTERACT,J.

However, the relationship between plant diversity and community stability is still controversial due to the scale effect of its influencing factors. In this study, we compared the changes in community stability and different plant diversity (i.e., species, functional, and phylogenetic diversities) between three communities (i.e., riparian forest, ecotone community, and desert shrubs), and across three spatial scales (i.e., 100, 400, and 2500 m(2)), and then quantified the contribution of soil properties and plant diversity to community stability by using structural equation model (SEM) in the Ebinur Lake Basin Nature Reserve of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the NW China. The results showed that: (1) community stability differed among three communities (ecotone community > desert shrubs > riparian forest). The stability of three communities all decreased with the increase of spatial scale (2) species diversity, phylogenetic richness and the mean pairwise phylogenetic distance were higher in ecotone community than that in desert shrubs and riparian forest, while the mean nearest taxa distance showed as riparian forest > ecotone community > desert shrubs. (3) Soil ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus had the significant direct negative and positive effects on the community stability, respectively. Soil ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus also indirectly affected community stability by adjusting plant diversity. The interaction among species, functional and phylogenetic diversities also regulated the variation of community stability across the spatial scales. Our results suggested that the effect of plant diversities on community stability were greater than that of soil factors. The asynchronous effect caused by the changes in species composition and functional traits among communities had a positive impact on the stability. Our study provided a theoretical support for the conservation and management of biodiversity and community functions in desert areas.","[Jiang, La-Mei; Lu, Guang-Hui; Zhang, Jie] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Jiang, La-Mei; Lu, Guang-Hui; Zhang, Jie] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Educ Minist, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Jiang, La-Mei; Lu, Guang-Hui; Zhang, Jie] Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Dese, Jinghe, Peoples R China; [Sattar, Kunduz] Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Reg Forestry Planning I, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Hu, Dong] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiao-Dong] Ningbo Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism Culture, Ningbo, Peoples R China",Xinjiang University; Xinjiang University; Northwest University Xi'an; Ningbo University,"Lu, GH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Coll Ecol & Environm, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Lu, GH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Educ Minist, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Lu, GH (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Dese, Jinghe, Peoples R China.;Yang, XD (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism Culture, Ningbo, Peoples R China.",guanghui_xju@sina.com; xjyangxd@sina.com,,"Hu, Dong/0009-0000-1408-7424; Yang, Xiao-Dong/0000-0002-3553-2125",,,,NA,94,3,3,30,48,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.","[Wang, Ran; Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Wang, R (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.",rw6@ualberta.ca,"Wang, Ran/AGM-2266-2022; Wang, Ran/AEM-8386-2022; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Gamon, John/A-2641-2014","Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Wang, Ran/0000-0002-3810-9103; Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723","NSF Research Coordination Networks (RCN); Keck Institute or Space Studies (KISS); iCORE/AITF [G224150012, 200700172]; NSERC [RGPIN-2015-05129]; CFI [26793]; NSF [1342823]; China Scholarship Council fellowship; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1342823] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",NSF Research Coordination Networks (RCN); Keck Institute or Space Studies (KISS); iCORE/AITF; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); CFI(Canada Foundation for Innovation); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); China Scholarship Council fellowship(China Scholarship Council); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"We thank J.

While drought-induced reductions in grassland primary productivity are well documented, the drivers behind drought resistance (the capacity to withstand change) and recovery (the capacity for recovery of function) of above- and below-ground biomass remain poorly understood. Across eight grasslands differing in plant community productivity (CP), we investigated the effects of summer drought on plant and soil microbial variables, plant nutrient content, and soil nitrogen (N) availability. We examined the linkages between CP, soil N, drought responses of plant and microbial communities, and relative drought responses of plant and microbial biomass. Plant and microbial variables were recorded at the end of a 3-month rainfall exclusion period. Plant variables were also assessed during a 10-month drought recovery period. Experimental drought decreased plant biomass and increased plant C:N ratios, but had no effect on total microbial biomass across sites. Instead, drought caused shifts in plant and microbial community structures as well as an increase in arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi biomass. Overall, plant biomass drought resistance was unrelated to CP or microbial community structure but was positively related to drought resistance of forbs. In the month after rewetting, soil N availability increased in droughted plots across sites. Two months post-rewetting, droughted plots had higher plant N concentration, but lower plant N use efficiency. The short-term drought recovery of plant biomass was unrelated to CP or soil N availability, but positively related to the response of grass biomass, reflecting incomplete recovery at high CP. Ten months after rewetting, drought effects on plant biomass and plant N content were no longer apparent. Synthesis. Our results suggest that drought resistance and recovery are more sensitive to plant community composition than to community productivity. Short-term recovery of plant biomass may also benefit from increased soil N availability after drought and from a high abundance of soil fungi in low productivity sites. Our findings underline the importance of plant functional groups for the stability of permanent grasslands in a changing climate with more frequent drought.","[Mackie, Kathleen A.; Zeiter, Michaela; Stampfli, Andreas] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Grassland Ecol, Bern, Switzerland; [Zeiter, Michaela; Stampfli, Andreas] Univ Bern, Inst Plant Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Zeiter, Michaela; Stampfli, Andreas] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Bloor, Juliette M.

However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year-old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch and Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L.laricina/A.saccharum and L.laricina/P.strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada. The experimentally imposed drought stress consisted of maintaining soil material for 30days at 25% of water-holding capacity (WHC). Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e. both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L.laricina/A.saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community-weighted means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralizable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralizable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience. We showed a trade-off between microbial resistance and resilience in soil food webs, which is consistent with ecological theory. Our results indicate that differences in functional traits between tree species may rapidly be reflected in divergent soil biochemical properties and that these differences can in turn drive soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought.","[Rivest, David; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Nat Sci, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Rivest, David; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Rivest, David; Paquette, Alain; Shipley, Bill; Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Shipley, Bill] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Western Sydney, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Sherbrooke; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University,"Rivest, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Nat Sci, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",david.rivest@uqo.ca,"Reich, Paul/D-4321-2013; Shipley, Bill/A-4578-2011","Reich, Paul/0000-0003-1192-5909; Shipley, Bill/0000-0002-7026-3880; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X",NSERC-RDC grant,NSERC-RDC grant,"We would like to thank the numerous individuals who helped establish and maintain the experiment and McGill University's Macdonald College campus staff for their support and the use of the land.

The objective of this study was to understand the stand dynamics of the planted mangroves and their functional traits in comparison with natural mangrove forests under similar site conditions. Methods Species composition, stand density, tree size distribution, and aboveground production were investigated along three transects in a 50-year-old planted mangrove stand and three transects in an adjacent natural mangrove stand in Shenzhen Bay, South China. Measurements were made on tree distribution by species, stand structure, and aboveground biomass (AGB) distribution. Analyses were performed on the spatial patterns of tree size distribution and species association. Important Findings We found that the planted and natural mangrove stands did not differ in stand density, average diameter at breast height (DBH), species composition, and AGB. Spatial distribution of AGB and frequency at species level were also similar between the planted and natural stands. However, the traits in stand structure were more variable in the planted stand than in the natural stand, indicating higher spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the development and succession of planted mangroves. Geostatistical analyses show that both DBH and AGB were spatially auto-correlated within a specific range in the direction perpendicular to coastline. More than 60%, of the variance in these attributes was due to spatial autocorrelation. The Ripley's K-function analysis shows that the two dominant species, Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, clumped in broader scales in the natural stand than in the planted stand and displayed significant interspecific competition across the whole transect. It is suggested that interspecific competition interacts with spatial autocorrelation as the underlying mechanism shaping the mangrove structure. This study demonstrates that at age 50, mangrove plantations can perform similarly in stand structure, spatial arrangement of selected stand characteristics and species associations to the natural mangrove forests.","[Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, MOE Key Lab Silviculture & Conversat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhongkui; Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Inst Forestry & Climate Change Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhongkui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hualin] Neilingding Futian Natl Nat Reserve Guangdong, Shenzhen 518040, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Sun, OJ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, MOE Key Lab Silviculture & Conversat, 35 Qinghua E Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",sunjianx@bjfu.edu.cn,"Luo, Zhongkui/D-1628-2011; Luo, Zhongkui/B-8125-2008","Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0003-0721-096X; Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0002-6744-6491; Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984",Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-SW-132]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2008BADB0B0302],"Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)",Key Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-SW-132); '11th Five-Year' Forestry Scientific and Technological Support Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2008BADB0B0302).,NA,61,32,33,7,85,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Here we use experimental mesocosms to test how the evolution of reduced cooperation in rhizobium mutualists in response to 20 years of nitrogen fertilization compares to the effects of rhizobium presence on soil nitrogen availability and plant community composition and diversity. The evolution of reduced rhizobium cooperation caused reductions in soil nitrogen, biological nitrogen fixation, and leaf nitrogen concentrations that were as strong as, or even stronger than, experimental rhizobium inoculation (presence/absence) treatments. Effects of both rhizobium evolution and rhizobium inoculation on legume dominance, plant community composition, and plant species diversity were often smaller in magnitude, but suggest that rhizobium evolution can alter the relative abundance of plant functional groups. Our findings indicate that the consequences of rapid microbial evolution for ecosystems and communities can rival the effects resulting from the presence or abundance of keystone mutualists.","[Lau, Jennifer A.; Hammond, Mark D.; Schmidt, Jennifer E.; Weese, Dylan J.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.; Hammond, Mark D.; Schmidt, Jennifer E.; Weese, Dylan J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Lau, Jennifer A.] Indiana Univ, Environm Resilience Inst, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Schmidt, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Yang, Wendy H.; Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, 505 South Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yang, Wendy H.; Heath, Katy D.] Univ Illinois, Carl R Woese Inst Genom Biol, 1206 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yang, Wendy H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, 1301 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Lau, JA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.;Lau, JA (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.;Lau, JA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.;Lau, JA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Environm Resilience Inst, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",jenlau@iu.edu,,,NSF [DEB-1257756]; NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the Kellogg Biological Station [NSF DEB-1637653]; Michigan State University AgBioResearch,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the Kellogg Biological Station(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Michigan State University AgBioResearch,"This research was supported by NSF DEB-1257756 awarded to JAL and KDH, by the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the Kellogg Biological Station (NSF DEB-1637653) and by Michigan State University AgBioResearch.",NA,59,0,0,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2022,200,1-fev.,,NA,,NA,133,143,,10.1007/s00442-022-05253-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05253-1,NA,SEP 2022,11,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,5D8NR,36125524,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000855611200001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within grasslands, photosynthetic pathway is an important functional trait yielding different rates of productivity along environmental gradients. Recently, C-3-C-4 sorting along spatial environmental gradients has been reassessed by controlling for confounding traits in phylogenetically structured comparisons. C-3 and C-4 grasses should sort along temporal environmental gradients as well, resulting in differing phenologies and growing season lengths. Here we use 10 years of satellite data (NDVI) to examine the phenology and greenness (as a proxy for productivity) of C-3 and C-4 grass habitats, which reflect differences in both environment and plant physiology. We perform phylogenetically structured comparisons based on 3,595 digitized herbarium collections of 152 grass species across the Hawaiian Islands. Our results show that the clade identity of grasses captures differences in their habitats better than photosynthetic pathway. Growing season length (GSL) and associated productivity (GSP) were not significantly different when considering photosynthetic type alone, but were indeed different when considering photosynthetic type nested within clade. The relationship between GSL and GSP differed most strongly between C-3 clade habitats, and not between C-3-C-4 habitats. Our results suggest that accounting for the interaction between phylogeny and photosynthetic pathway can help improve predictions of productivity, as commonly used C-3-C-4 classifications are very broad and appear to mask important diversity in grassland ecosystem functions.","[Pau, Stephanie] Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Still, Christopher J.] Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Oregon State University,"Pau, S (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Geog, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",spau@fsu.edu,,"Still, Christopher/0000-0002-8295-4494","NSF [EF-0553768]; University of California, Santa Barbara; State of California; Florida State University's Committee on Faculty Research Support (COFRS) Award; NASA New Investigator Program award","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of California, Santa Barbara(University of California System); State of California; Florida State University's Committee on Faculty Research Support (COFRS) Award; NASA New Investigator Program award","This work was initiated while SP was a Postdoctoral Associate at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center funded by NSF (Grant #EF-0553768), the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the State of California.

Previous studies have demonstrated that vegetation productivity is enhanced by improved soil nutrient status in humid environments and is influenced by climate in arid environments. However, the responses of biomass productivity to different patterns of climate-plant-soil in different natural grassland ecosystems have not been clearly and comprehensively analyzed. In this study, we systematically explore the functional patterns of different grasslands, as well as the underlying mechanisms in the response to key climatic, soil, and plant factors. The survey range covered broad environmental gradients from humid, semi-arid, to arid environments in Tibetan and Inner Mongolian Plateaus. We found that the above-and belowground biomass production gradually decreased from humid, semi-arid, to arid environments. Biomass production was sensitive to climatic factors in different environments. However, compared to soil and plant factors, climate was always the most important factor determining biomass production in all grassland types. Furthermore, biomass production was regulated mainly by climate and soil characteristics in humid environments, but by climate in arid environments. Spe-cifically, the corresponding limiting factors of each factor largely dominated the effects of the corresponding factors on different grasslands. For instance, the climate dominated by temperature negatively influenced the soil nutrient availability and then influenced the aboveground biomass production in alpine humid grasslands. These findings enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity of mechanisms of different grasslands along broad environmental gradients, which are crucial for predicting the effects and consequences of environmental change on terrestrial ecosystem functioning.","[Wu, Wenjuan; Zhou, Guangsheng; Xu, Zhenzhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenjuan; Xu, Zhenzhu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangsheng] China Meteorol Adm, Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China Meteorological Administration; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS)","Xu, ZZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",xuzz@ibcas.ac.cn,"Wu, wenjuan/GPX-6968-2022; Xu, Zhenzhu/L-1362-2015","Xu, Zhenzhu/0000-0001-5246-8981",Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program [2019QZKK0106]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA26010103],Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"Acknowledgments This study was funded by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program (2019QZKK0106) , and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA26010103) .

These perturbations may cause major reshuffling of Arctic species compositions and functional trait profiles and diversity, thereby affecting ecosystem processes of the whole tundra region. Earlier research has detected important drivers of the change in plant functional traits under warming climate, but studies on one key factor, snow cover, are almost totally lacking. Here we integrate plot-scale vegetation data with detailed climate and snow information using machine learning methods to model the responsiveness of tundra communities to different scenarios of warming and snow cover duration. Our results show that decreasing snow cover, together with warming temperatures, can substantially modify biotic communities and their trait compositions, with future plant communities projected to be occupied by taller plants with larger leaves and faster resource acquisition strategies. As another finding, we show that, while the local functional diversity may increase, simultaneous biotic homogenization across tundra communities is likely to occur. The manifestation of climate warming on tundra vegetation is highly dependent on the evolution of snow conditions. Given this, realistic assessments of future ecosystem functioning require acknowledging the role of snow in tundra vegetation models.","[Niittynen, Pekka; Luoto, Miska] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Heikkinen, Risto K.] Finnish Environm Inst, Biodivers Ctr, FIN-00790 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Finnish Environment Institute,"Niittynen, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",pekka.niittynen@helsinki.fi,"Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014; Heikkinen, Risto K./AAN-6257-2020","Heikkinen, Risto K./0000-0003-4190-5108; Niittynen, Pekka/0000-0002-7290-029X","Academy of Finland [286950, 312559]; Kone Foundation; Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica; Doctoral Programme in Geosciences at the University of Helsinki - Ministry of Environment, Finland; Academy of Finland (AKA) [286950, 312559] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)","Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Kone Foundation; Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica; Doctoral Programme in Geosciences at the University of Helsinki - Ministry of Environment, Finland; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of FinlandFinnish Funding Agency for Technology & Innovation (TEKES))","We are grateful for research support provided by the Academy of Finland (Projects 286950 and 312559), Kone Foundation, Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica, the Doctoral Programme in Geosciences at the University of Helsinki, and The protected area network in the changing climate (SUMI) project funded by the Ministry of Environment, Finland.

Most studies have focused on soil microbes in the bulk soil, the rhizosphere and inside plant roots, however, less is known about the soil community that exists within soil aggregates, and how these soil communities influence plant biomass production. Here, using field-conditioned soil collected from experimental ungrazed and grazed grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China, we examined the composition of microbiomes inside soil aggregates of various size classes, and determined their roles in plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs), diversity-productivity relation-ships, and diversity-dependent overyielding. We found that grazing induced significantly positive PSF effects, which appeared to be mediated by mycorrhizal fungi, particularly under plant monocultures. Despite this, non -additive effects of microbiomes within different soil aggregates enhanced the strength of PSF under ungrazed grassland, but decreased PSF strength under intensively grazed grassland. Plant mixture-related increases in PSF effects markedly enhanced diversity-dependent overyielding, primarily due to complementary effects. Selection effects played far less of a role. Our work suggests that PSF contributes to diversity-dependent overyielding in grasslands via non-additive effects of microbiomes within different soil aggregates. The implication of our work is that assessing the effectiveness of sustainable grassland restoration and management on soil properties requires inspection of soil aggregate size-specific microbiomes, as these are relevant determinants of the feedback in-teractions between soil and plant performance.","[Li, Xiliang; Zhang, Zhen; Li, Yuanheng; Jin, Ke] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Key Lab Grassland Ecol & Restorat, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiliang; Van Der Putten, Wim H.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Terr Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lu, Xiaotao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Erguna Forest Steppe Ecotone Res Stn, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Van Der Putten, Wim H.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Nematol, NL-6700 ES Wageningen, Netherlands","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Grassland Research, CAAS; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Wageningen University & Research","Li, YH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Grassland Res, Key Lab Grassland Ecol & Restorat, Hohhot 010010, Peoples R China.",liyuanheng@caas.cn,"Lu, Xiao-Tao/B-3905-2008; van der Putten, Wim H/C-3707-2011","Lu, Xiao-Tao/0000-0001-5571-1895; van der Putten, Wim H/0000-0002-9341-4442",Central Public -interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund [Y2022QC29]; Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Project [2021ZY0039]; China Scholarship Council,Central Public -interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund; Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The authors thank the staff of Xilingol Grassland Research Station of CAAS for the assistance in the field sampling.

In marine systems, knowledge of how plant diversity influences ecosystem processes and higher trophic levels is still limited. To examine how plant richness and composition influence recruitment and colonization processes, defaunated eelgrass (Zostera marina), sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) and perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus) were planted on an unvegetated, sandy bottom in all possible combinations in July and August. Both field experiments lasted 1 week. Our results showed that in these plant assemblages plant richness had a negative effect on faunal diversity (H') and evenness (I'), while total abundance showed strong temporal variation with weak, positive relationships with plant species richness in both August and July. Plant species composition had strong effects on amphipods (Gammarus spp.), thus both the abundance and biomass were higher in treatments containing P. perfoliatus. The colonization process was significantly influenced by the numerical dominance of a few faunal species, e.g. the settlement of lagoon cockles (Cerastoderma glaucum), and by the timing of the experiments. The results indicate that faunal colonization in these communities is rapid and significantly influenced by the traits of particular plant species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Flooding affects above- and belowground ecosystem processes, representing a substantial threat to crop productivity under climate change. Plant-associated fungi play important roles in plant performance, but their response to abnormal rain events is unresolved. Here, we established a glasshouse experiment to determine the effects of flooding stress on the spring wheat-mycobiota complex. Since plant phenology could be an important factor in the response to hydrological stress, flooding was induced only once and at different plant growth stages, such as tillering, booting and flowering. We assessed the wheat mycobiota response to flooding in three soil-plant compartments (phyllosphere, roots and rhizosphere) using metabarcoding. Key soil and plant traits were measured to correlate physiological plant and edaphic changes with shifts in mycobiota structure and functional guilds. Flooding reduced plant fitness, and caused dramatic shifts in mycobiota assembly across the entire plant. Notably, we observed a functional transition consisting of a decline in mutualist abundance and richness with a concomitant increase in plant pathogens. Indeed, fungal pathogens associated with important cereal diseases, such as Gibberella intricans, Mycosphaerella graminicola, Typhula incarnata and Olpidium brassicae significantly increased their abundance under flooding. Overall, our study demonstrate the detrimental effect of flooding on the wheat mycobiota complex, highlighting the urgent need to understand how climate change-associated abiotic stressors alter plant-microbe interactions in cereal crops.","[Francioli, Davide] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Fac Agr Sci, Stuttgart, Germany; [Francioli, Davide; Kolb, Steffen] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res eV ZALF, Microbial Biogeochem, Res Area Landscape Functioning, Muncheberg, Germany; [Cid, Geeisy; Hajirezaei, Mohammad-Reza] Leibniz Inst Plant Genet & Crop Plant Res, Dept Physiol & Cell Biol, Gatersleben, Germany; [Kolb, Steffen] Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany",University Hohenheim; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Leibniz Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Francioli, D (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Fac Agr Sci, Stuttgart, Germany.;Francioli, D (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res eV ZALF, Microbial Biogeochem, Res Area Landscape Functioning, Muncheberg, Germany.",davide.francioli@zalf.de,,"Kolb, Steffen/0000-0002-5455-8662; Francioli, Davide/0000-0001-6572-3574",Leibniz Competition Program project Volcorn-Volatilome of a Cereal Crop Microbiota Complex under Drought and Flooding (Leibniz Association) [K102/2018],Leibniz Competition Program project Volcorn-Volatilome of a Cereal Crop Microbiota Complex under Drought and Flooding (Leibniz Association),This study was funded by the Leibniz Competition Program project Volcorn-Volatilome of a Cereal Crop Microbiota Complex under Drought and Flooding (K102/2018) (Leibniz Association).,NA,106,0,0,16,16,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Grassland carbon sink is determined by both plant biomass and carbon sink per unit biomass (specific carbon sink). This specific carbon sink could reflect grassland adaptative response, because plants generally tend to adaptively enhance the functioning of their remaining biomass after grazing (i.e. higher leaf nitrogen content). Though we know well about the regulation of grassland biomass on carbon sink, little attention is paid to the role of specific carbon sink. Thus, we conducted a 14-year grazing experiment in a desert grassland. Ecosystem carbon fluxes, including net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were measured frequently during five consecutive growing seasons with contrasting precipitation events. We found that heavy grazing reduced NEE more in drier (-94.0 %) than wetter (-33.9 %) years. However, grazing did not reduce community biomass much more in drier (-70.4 %) than wetter years (-66.0 %). These meant a positive response of specific NEE (NEE per unit biomass) to grazing in wetter years. This positive response of specific NEE was mainly caused by a higher biomass ratio of other species versus perennial grasses with greater leaf nitrogen content and specific leaf area in wetter years. In addition, we also detected a shift of grazing effects on specific NEE from positive in wetter years to negative in drier years. Overall, this study is among the first to reveal the adaptive response of grassland specific carbon sink to experimental grazing in plant trait view. The stimulation response of specific carbon sink can partially compensate for the loss of grassland carbon storage under grazing. These new findings highlight the role of grassland adaptive response in decelerating climate warming.","[Jin, Yuxi; Wu, Qian; Han, Mengqi; Wang, Yuehua; Han, Guodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Key Lab Forage Cultivat Proc & High Efficient Uti, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China; [Tian, Dashuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiangwen] Yan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yanan 716000, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zhanlei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atm, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Sci, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China","Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University","Han, GD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Key Lab Forage Cultivat Proc & High Efficient Uti, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China.;Tian, DS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",tiands@igsnrr.ac.cn; hanguodong@imau.edu.cn,,,,,,NA,48,0,0,27,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,1879-1026,,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

However, little is known about how these disturbances interact to affect ecosystem functioning. We established a field experiment to test for effects of loss of consumer species on algal assemblages (richness and assemblage structure) and ecosystem functioning (ecosystem productivity and algal biomass accumulation) on rocky shores. We manipulated the presence of three common molluscan grazer species in newly created rock pools over 13months. Our grazer manipulation was based on a subtractive experimental design, and we also manipulated nutrient concentrations to evaluate explicitly how resource availability affected the consequences of species loss. We found that the effects of loss of grazer species on algal assemblages and their functioning depended strongly on both the identity of the grazer species lost and of those remaining in the community. Moreover, the effects of loss of species depended on nutrient availability, making it extremely difficult to predict the effects of species loss generally without detailed knowledge of a system. Our results demonstrate clearly that the effects of grazer species loss on primary producers and ecosystem functioning may not be generalisable based on grazer functional roles or traits.Synthesis. Our findings highlight the need to include key physical drivers, such as nutrient availability, explicitly into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning models in order to move towards a predictive framework that incorporates the effects of both environmental heterogeneity and anthropogenic stressors.","[O'Connor, Nessa E.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Bracken, Matthew E.

Nitrogen (N) cycling is a key process determining ecosystem functioning in subalpine grasslands where traditional mowing and manuring are being abandoned. However, the roles of the plant and microbial communities in mediating changes in N availability are still poorly understood. 2. We inoculated 15 subalpine grassland fields with dual-labelled ammonium nitrate (15NH(4)+, 15NO(3)-) during July 2005 and used pool dilutions over 1 month to calculate inorganic N fluxes into the microbial pool and uptake in plant communities by grasses, forbs and legumes. The effects of current land abandonment were assessed by comparing manured and mown terraces (ancient croplands) with other terraces where these practices have ceased, and mown versus unmown unterraced meadows. 3. Rapid cycling of inorganic N and high soil N availability in forb-dominated manured and mown terraces resulted from fast plant N uptake and low microbial C:N ratio. In grass-dominated unmown terraces, N cycling was slower and N retention was greater; microbial N uptake remained similar to that in the other terraces, although a higher C:N ratio suggested a shift towards fungal dominance. 4. In unterraced meadows, pH was low due to reduced mixing of soil with the underlying calcareous rock. Soil [NH4+] was high and [NO3-] low, but current management had no effect on N pool size, although plant N uptake was greater in the mown than unmown fields. This may be partially explained by high N retention by dominant Festuca paniculata tussocks. The microbial N pool and N uptake were both low and the microbial C:N ratio was high, suggesting that fungi slowed N cycling and reduced the influence of mowing on N turnover. 5. Synthesis. In these marginal long-term grasslands, with low productivity and high biodiversity value, changes in ecosystem function associated with reduced management intensity were mediated through slower N cycling. This response was expressed as more gradual nutrient uptake but greater retention by unmown plant communities, slower microbial uptake and smaller soil N pools. In contrast to more productive ecosystems, such as north-western European grasslands, reduced management is detrimental to both biodiversity and the maintenance of soil-related ecosystem services. These costs will need to be balanced against potential benefits, such as carbon storage.","[Matthew Robson, T.; Baptist, Florence; Clement, Jean-Christophe; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Matthew Robson, T.; Baptist, Florence; Clement, Jean-Christophe; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMS 2925, Stn Alpine Joseph Fourier, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Matthew Robson, T.] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria, CIFOR, Unidad Mixta INIA UPM, Madrid 28040, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Robson, TM (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, BP53, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France.",mrobson04@googlemail.com,"CLEMENT, Jean-Christophe/C-8589-2011; Robson, Thomas Matthew/J-3381-2012","CLEMENT, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-0841-7199; Robson, Thomas Matthew/0000-0002-8631-796X",CNRS 'ATIP' TDE; CNRS,CNRS 'ATIP' TDE; CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)),"The work was made possible through a grant from CNRS 'ATIP' TDE and CNRS incentive fund for nitrogen cycle research to the Station Alpine Joseph Fourier.

Scattered trees of these ecosystems could potentially mitigate the impact of climate change on herbaceous plant community but this issue has not yet tested experimentally. We carried out a field manipulative experiment of increased temperature (+2-3 ?) using Open Top Chambers and rainfall reduction (30%) through rain-exclusion shelters to evaluate how net primary productivity and digestibility respond to climate change over three consecutive years, and to test whether scattered trees could buffer the effects of higher aridity in Mediterranean dehesas. First, we observed that herbaceous communities located beneath tree canopy were less productive (351 g/m(2)) than in open grassland (493 g/m2) but had a higher digestibility (44% and 41%, respectively), likely promoted by tree shade and the higher soil fertility of this habitat. Second, both habitats responded similarly to climate change in terms of net primary productivity, with a 33% increase under warming and a 13% decrease under reduced rainfall. In contrast, biomass digestibility decreased under increased temperatures (-7.5%), since warming enhanced the fiber and lignin content and decreased the crude protein content of aerial biomass. This warming-induced effect on biomass digestibility only occurred in open grasslands, suggesting a buffering role of trees in mitigating the impact of climate change. Third, warming did not only affect these ecosystem processes in a direct way but also indirectly via changes in plant functional composition. Our findings suggest that climate change will alter both the quantity and quality of pasture production, with expected warmer conditions increasing net primary productivity but at the expense of reducing digestibility. This negative effect of warming on digestibility might be mitigated by scattered trees, highlighting the importance of implementing strategies and suitable management to control tree density in these ecosystems.",,,,mdhidalgogalvez@gmail.com; karim.barkaoui@cirad.fr; florence.volaire@cefe.cnrs.fr; lmatias@us.es; cambrolle@us.es; ir1ferep@uco.es; mariad.carbonero@juntadeandalucia.es; imperez@irnase.csic.es,"Matias, Luis/K-6761-2014; Rebollo, Pilar Fernández/ABH-3642-2020; Barkaoui, Karim/AAP-6388-2020; Cambrolle, Jesus/G-7133-2012","Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390; Rebollo, Pilar Fernández/0000-0001-7215-412X; Barkaoui, Karim/0000-0002-5787-3748; Cambrolle, Jesus/0000-0002-9750-6328",MICINN project DECAFUN [CGL2015-70123-R]; Association of Hispanic-French Friendship (AVENIR-DIALOGO); Formacion de Personal Investigador (FPI) [BES-2016-078248],MICINN project DECAFUN; Association of Hispanic-French Friendship (AVENIR-DIALOGO); Formacion de Personal Investigador (FPI)(Spanish Government),"We thank to S.

Current intensification and expansion practices add to the degradation of grasslands and dramatically increase greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Thus, new ways to sustain and improve their productivity are needed. Research efforts focus on the plant-leaf microbiome, or phyllosphere, because its microbial members impact ecosystem function by influencing pathogen resistance, plant hormone production, and nutrient availability through processes including nitrogen fixation. However, little is known about grassland phyllospheres and their response to environmental stress. In this study, globally dominant temperate and tropical forage grass species were grown in a greenhouse under current climate conditions and drought conditions that mimic future climate predictions to understand if (i) plant host taxa influence microbial community assembly, (ii) microbial communities respond to drought stress, and (iii) phyllosphere community changes correlate to changes in plant host traits and stress-response strategies. Community analysis using high-resolution sequencing revealed Gammaproteobacteria as the dominant bacterial class, which increased under severe drought stress on both temperate and tropical grasses while overall bacterial community diversity declined. Bacterial community diversity, structure, and response to drought were significantly different between grass species. This community dependence on plant host species correlated with differences in grass species traits, which became more defined under drought stress conditions, suggesting symbiotic evolutionary relationships between plant hosts and their associated microbial community. Further understanding these strategies and the functions microbes provide to plants will help us utilize microbes to promote agricultural and ecosystem productivity in the future. IMPORTANCE Globally important grassland ecosystems are at risk of degradation due to poor management practices compounded by predicted increases in severity and duration of drought over the next century. Finding new ways to support grassland productivity is critical to maintaining their ecological and agricultural benefits. Discerning how grassland microbial communities change in response to climate stress will help us understand how plant-microbe relationships may be useful to sustainably support grasslands in the future. In this study, phyllosphere community diversity and composition were significantly altered under drought conditions. The significance of our research is demonstrating how severe climate stress reduces bacterial community diversity, which previously was directly associated with decreased plant productivity. These findings guide future questions about functional plantmicrobe interactions under stress conditions, greatly enhancing our understanding of how bacteria can increase food security by promoting grassland growth and resilience.","[Bechtold, Emily K.; Ryan, Stephanie; Moughan, Sarah E.; Nusslein, Klaus] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Microbiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Ranjan, Ravi] Univ Massachusetts, Inst Appl Life Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Nusslein, K (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Microbiol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",nusslein@microbio.umass.edu,,"Nusslein, Klaus/0000-0002-0663-4448",Lotta M.

Analyzing microbial genes in the rhizosphere of plants, especially those associated with plant growth promotion and carbon cycling, is important for improving soil fertility and crop productivity. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of microbial genes present in the rhizosphere samples of two maize fields with different agricultural histories using shotgun metagenomics. Genes involved in the nutrient mobilization, including nifA, fixJ, norB, pstA, kefA and B, and ktrB were significantly more abundant (alpha = 0.05) in former grassland (F1) rhizosphere soils. Among the carbon-cycling genes, the abundance of 12 genes, including all those involved in the degradation of methane were more significant (alpha = 0.05) in the F1 soils, whereas only five genes were significantly more abundant in the F2 soils. alpha-diversity indices were different across the samples and significant differences were observed in the beta diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes between the fields (ANOSIM, p = 0.01 and R = 0.52). Nitrate-nitrogen (N-NO3) was the most influential physicochemical parameter (p = 0.05 and contribution = 31.3%) that affected the distribution of the functional genes across the samples. The results indicate that land-use and management histories impact the composition and diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes in the plant rhizosphere. The study widens our understanding of the effects of anthropogenic activities on plant health and major biogeochemical processes in soils.","[Chukwuneme, Chinenyenwa Fortune; Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti] North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Food Secur & Safety Niche Area, Private Bag X2046, ZA-2735 Mmabatho, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Babalola, OO (corresponding author), North West Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Food Secur & Safety Niche Area, Private Bag X2046, ZA-2735 Mmabatho, South Africa.",olubukola.babalola@nwu.ac.za,"Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023; Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun/F-4443-2018","Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun/0000-0002-3220-1873; Chukwuneme, Chinenyenwa Fortune/0000-0002-3995-208X","National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa [UID123634, UID132595]","National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","OOB is thankful to the National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa, for supporting research in her lab (Grants: UID123634 and UID132595).",NA,70,5,5,18,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4425,,GENES-BASEL,Genes,SEP,2021,12,9,,NA,,NA,,,1431,10.3390/genes12091431,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes12091431,NA,,18,Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Genetics & Heredity,UV4TD,34573413,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000699472000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One mechanism behind this biodiversity effect is facilitation, which is when one species increases the performance of another species. Plants with extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) establish defense mutualisms with ants. However, whether EFN plants facilitate defense of neighboring non-EFN plants is unknown. Synthesizing data on ants, herbivores, leaf damage, and defense traits from a forest biodiversity experiment, we show that trees growing adjacent to EFN trees had higher ant biomass and species richness and lower caterpillar biomass than conspecific controls without EFN-bearing neighbors. Concurrently, the composition of defense traits in non-EFN trees changed. Thus, when non-EFN trees benefit from lower herbivore loads as a result of ants spilling over from EFN tree neighbors, this may allow relatively reduced resource allocation to defense in the former, potentially explaining the higher growth of those trees. Via this mutualist-mediated facilitation, promoting EFN trees in tropical reforestation could foster carbon capture and multiple other ecosystem functions.","[Staab, Michael; Bluethgen, Nico] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Ecol Networks, Darmstadt, Germany; [Pietsch, Stefanie] Univ Freiburg, Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Germany; [Pietsch, Stefanie] Univ Wurzburg, Field Stn Fabrikschleichach, Wurzburg, Germany; [Yan, Haoru; Cheng, Anpeng; Li, Yi; Ma, Keping; Liu, Xiaojuan] Inst Bot, Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Anpeng; Ma, Keping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Naili] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaojuan] Zhejiang Qianjiangyuan Forest Biodivers Natl Obse, Beijing, Peoples R China","Technical University of Darmstadt; University of Freiburg; University of Wurzburg; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Forestry University","Liu, XJ (corresponding author), Inst Bot, Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liu, XJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Qianjiangyuan Forest Biodivers Natl Obse, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuxiaojuan06@ibcas.ac.cn,"Staab, Michael/I-6544-2019","Staab, Michael/0000-0003-0894-7576; Ma, Keping/0000-0001-9112-5340",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF0802300]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB31000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [32161123003]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2019082]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STA 1611/3-1],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: STA 1611/3-1; National Key Research Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2022YFF0802300; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 32161123003; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDB31000000; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 2019082",NA,88,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,2023 MAY 5,2023,NA,,,NA,,NA,,,,10.1002/ecy.4057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.4057,NA,MAY 2023,14,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,F4MC7,37078562,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000982094900001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In megadiverse tropical forests, these relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem processes, such as litter decomposition, are poorly explored. While the direct effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition are relatively well known, the indirect effects of diversity, and the local community and microenvironment have rarely been investigated. We evaluated the indirect effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition in a tropical forest. We assessed diversity using different components (plant species richness, functional composition, and functional diversity), evaluated the environmental gradient (soil attributes, topography and canopy cover) and related it to the dynamics of litter decomposition. A 230-day in situ experiment was performed in the southern areas of the Brazilian Atlantic forest using litterbags filled with standard substrate (to test the indirect effects) to evaluate the decomposition rates. In parallel, we also conducted a taxonomic and functional survey of the vegetation in the area of influence of the decomposition experiment. We demonstrated that there is an indirect effect of plant diversity, via taxonomic and functional diversifies, on litter decomposition. The indirect effect is more pronounced at the beginning of the decomposition process, and the influences of different components of diversity and ecological mechanisms (niche complementarity, mass effect and selection effect) vary over time. Our study revealed the importance of not only small-scale variations in the biotic component but also those of soil in ecosystem functioning in a megadiverse forest. In this way, we have contributed to a better understanding of the determinants of the decomposition process, in addition to those suggested by classical theoretical models (i.e., climate, litter composition and decomposers).","[Oliveira, Ricardo A.

However, there is only limited understanding of the multiple biotic interactions in perennial cropping systems and their potential effects on the crop, involving plant growth-promoting and pathogenic microorganisms, beneficial and detrimental faunal organisms below-and above-ground, weeds, and overall biodiversity effects. We use information from studies carried out in managed and natural perennial systems of analogous structure such as perennial energy crop production systems and grasslands to highlight and specify biotic interactions and processes, which potentially constitute advantages and constraints in developing perennial grain cropping systems. Concerning the relevance of soil microorganisms and potential perennial crop breeding goals, we focus on a range of plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere involved in biofertilization, phytostimulation, and biological control of soil pathogens. We consider relationships within the faunal community emphasizing arthropod pests and their natural enemies, as well as crop-weed interactions. Based on these outcomes and in comparison with annual systems, we discuss and compile benefits, options, and limitations of management of crop-associated biotic interactions and biodiversity, which might contribute to reproducible and sustainable effects of perennial grain crop productivity. We conclude that management strategies for perennial grain cropping systems depend much more on ecological processes and interactions operating in natural ecosystems than those in annual cropping systems. Consequently, the use of agrochemicals for pest, weed, and disease control, as well as the use of synthetic fertilizers, counteracts the principle functions of the system and would strongly degrade the potential of biotic benefits. We also found that there is only vague information on the long-term productivity and cultivation period of perennial grain crops, the specific management operations of replacement, and the potential development and management of weed and pest populations. Overall, an advanced understanding of interactions between the crop and its biotic environment provides the opportunity to manipulate specific functional traits of crop-associated organisms for improved management and crop productivity, but significant research challenges for implementation of perennial grain crops still remain.","[Rasche, Frank; Belz, Regina; Musyoki, Mary K.; Zimmermann, Judith; Martin, Konrad] Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Blagodatskaya, Evgenia] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Soil Sci Temperate Ecosyst, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Emmerling, Christoph] Univ Trier, Dept Soil Sci, D-54286 Trier, Germany",University Hohenheim; University of Gottingen; Universitat Trier,"Rasche, F (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Hans Ruthenberg Inst, Inst Agr Sci Trop, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",frank.rasche@uni-hohenheim.de,"Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/L-7177-2017","Blagodatskaya, Evgenia/0000-0002-8284-4017; Rasche, Frank/0000-0002-2202-851X",,,,NA,198,14,15,6,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,,,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,DEC,2017,8,12,,NA,,NA,,,e02048,10.1002/ecs2.2048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2048,NA,,24,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FT8SJ,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000423423200031,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated climatic variables, plant traits, edaphic properties, and microbial dimensions from various plots with an elevation gradient in a broad-leaved-Korean pine mixed forest. With increasing elevation, isothermality significantly increased; however, temperature and precipitation seasonality, as well as the mean temperature of the warmest quarter, significantly declined. Furthermore, high elevation sites were characterized by increased stand basal areas (Ba) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) tree abundance but featured decreases in the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees and the values of community-weighted mean (CWM) foliar traits (e.g., leaf area, leaf nitrogen content and leaf phosphorus content). Moreover, soil nutrient status, fungal and bacterial diversity indices, fungal saprotrophs, and bacterial function groups related to nitrite oxidation, ammonia oxidation, and nitrate denitrification were all negatively correlated to the elevation increment. In contrast, high elevation sites were characterized by enhanced EM growth and bacterial nitrogen fixation groups. Correlation analysis showed that the microbial diversity and relative abundances of microbial functional groups in soil were significantly influenced by climatic variability, CWM foliar traits and soil nutrient status. These findings demonstrate that the forces driving biological processes along climatic gradients are predictably in tandem with, but related to different extents, to the spatial compartmentalization of climatic variability in forest ecosystems at local scales.","[Ye, Ji; Bai, Zhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [Cong, Linlin] Dalian Jiaotong Univ, Sch Art & Design, Dalian 116028, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shufang] Weifang Univ, Coll Rural Revitalizat, Weifang 261061, Peoples R China; [Tian, Shuguo] Forestry Affairs Ctr Dalian Jinpu New Dist, Dalian 116000, Peoples R China; [Sun, Haihong] Liaoning Prov Inst Poplar, Yingkou 115000, Peoples R China; [Luan, Yuting] Xiuyan Forestry & Grassland Dev Serv Ctr, Xiuyan 118400, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Dalian Jiaotong University; Weifang University","Bai, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",baizhen@iae.ac.cn,,", zhen/0000-0003-1513-0839",National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFF1300505]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42230515],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2022YFF1300505) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 42230515).,NA,60,0,0,13,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JAN,2023,14,1,,NA,,NA,,,98,10.3390/f14010098,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14010098,NA,,15,Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Forestry,7Y4UW,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000914877300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using large-scale, spatio-temporal data, we use both compositional and functional indices to investigate land-use change impacts on the vegetation of a semi-natural grassland ecosystem (Machair) for fourteen regions in Scotland, UK. Our study aimed to identify national- and regional-scale temporal vegetation patterns, and through use of simple compositional and functional indices (e.g. Competitor, Stress, Ruderal and Ellenberg scores) link observed changes to agricultural intensification and/or land-use abandonment. Using linear-mixed modelling and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling, we showed significant national and regional-scale changes in species composition over time. Increases in diversity, particularly gains in Machair grassland, identified several regions that may have benefited from past government incentivised schemes to protect the Machair, but which may also be suffering from an extinction lag. Shifts in plant functional signatures (CSR & Ellenberg values) identified varying degrees of internal (competition) and external (land-use) factors, highlighting several regions where biodiversity change could be linked to reduced disturbance (i.e. lower grazing intensity) or greater disturbance (i.e. land-use intensification). Our results demonstrate the utility of simple compositional and functional indices for monitoring biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands and identifying land-use drivers of change across different spatial scales.

For 11 years we tracked the influences of plant longevity, life-form richness, and tree species identity on 12 soil chemical properties in model ecosystems on an allophanic Andisol in the humid lowlands of Costa Rica. The design employed three levels of plant longevity: 1 year and 4 years (trees cut without biomass removal and replanted to same species), and uncut; two levels of life-form diversity (tree alone, or tree plus palm plus giant perennial herb); and three eudicot, non-nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species. The site's Andisol proved remarkably resistant to treatment-induced loss of fertility. Although the magnitude of changes was low, most properties declined during the early phases of plant growth, then stabilized or increased. The greatest declines occurred in stands of shortest life span, where organic matter inputs were low and leaching rates were high. In contrast, massive depositions of organic matter every 4 years sustained or augmented surface-soil cation concentrations, pH, organic carbon (SOC), and extractable phosphorus (P). An increase in diversity from one life form to three led to more SOC and calcium (Ca), whereas potassium (K) decreased due to a species effect: high K uptake by the giant herb. The most notable tree-species effects concerned P: It increased under the species that had the highest litterfall and may facilitate apatite weathering; it decreased under the species of highest tissue-N concentrations. Through its effects on soil exposure and organic matter returns, plant longevity exerted greater influence on more soil properties than either diversity or species identity.","[Ewel, John J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Julia Mazzarino, Maria] CRUB CONICET, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Celis, Gerardo] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ewel, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, POB 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jackewel@ufl.edu,,"Celis, Gerardo/0000-0003-1265-4063",U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1035318]; U.S. Forest Service; Andrew W.

The acquisition of soil resources by plant roots is therefore an important component of plant fitness and agricultural productivity. Plant root systems comprise a set of phenes, or traits, that interact. Phenes are the units of the plant phenotype, and phene states represent the variation in form and function a particular phene may take. Root phenes can be classified as affecting resource acquisition or utilization, influencing acquisition through exploration or exploitation, and in being metabolically influential or neutral. These classifications determine how one phene will interact with another phene, whether through foraging mechanisms or metabolic economics. Phenes that influence one another through foraging mechanisms are likely to operate within a phene module, a group of interacting phenes, that may be co-selected. Examples of root phene interactions discussed are: (1) root hair length x root hair density, (2) lateral branching x root cortical aerenchyma (RCA), (3) adventitious root number x adventitious root respiration and basal root growth angle (BRGA), (4) nodal root number x RCA, and (5) BRGA x root hair length and density. Progress in the study of phenes and phene interactions will be facilitated by employing simulation modeling and near-isophenic lines that allow the study of specific phenes and phene combinations within a common phenotypic background. Developing a robust understanding of the phenome at the organismal level will require new lines of inquiry into how phenotypic integration influences plant function in diverse environments. A better understanding of how root phenes interact to affect soil resource acquisition will be an important tool in the breeding of crops with superior stress tolerance and reduced dependence on intensive use of inputs.","[York, Larry M.; Nord, Eric A.; Lynch, Jonathan P.] Penn State Univ, Intercoll Program Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [York, Larry M.; Nord, Eric A.; Lynch, Jonathan P.] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Lynch, JP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, 109 Tyson Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpl4@psu.edu,"York, Larry/H-8451-2019","York, Larry/0000-0002-1995-9479",US National Science Foundation/Basic Research to Enhance Agricultural Development [4184-UM-NSF-5380]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems [0965380] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation/Basic Research to Enhance Agricultural Development; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation/Basic Research to Enhance Agricultural Development (grant no. 4184-UM-NSF-5380).,NA,131,161,168,1,119,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Connected individuals (ramets) of clonal plants can translocate and share, for example, photosynthates, water and nutrients, and such physiological integration may affect performance of clonal plants both in heterogeneous and homogeneous environments. However, we still lack a general understanding of whether or how physiological integration in clonal plants differs across homogeneous versus heterogeneous environments. We compiled data from 198 peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted in 19 countries with 108 clonal plant species from 35 families, and carried out a meta-analysis of effects of physiological integration on 16 traits related to plant growth, morphology, physiology or allocation. Our analyses evaluated these relationships in (A) heterogeneous environments where at least one resource essential for plant growth (e.g. light, soil water and mineral nutrients) or non-resource factor (e.g. grazing, trampling and burial) is spatially non-uniformly distributed and (B) homogeneous environments where all these factors are spatially uniformly distributed. Physiological integration increased growth of whole clones in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments due to its highly significant contribution to growth of recipient ramets. Integration did not affect growth of donor ramets in heterogeneous environments, but decreased it in homogeneous environments. Integration affected physiological traits of donor ramets in neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous environments. It did not affect any physiological traits of recipient ramets in homogeneous environments, but increased most of them in heterogeneous environments. For donor ramets, integration increased height by 53% and internode length by 37% in heterogeneous environments, but had no effect in homogeneous environments. For recipient ramets, integration increased height by 73% in homogeneous environments and by 115% in heterogeneous environments, and increased internode length by 35% only under heterogeneous environments. In heterogeneous environments, integration increased biomass allocation to roots of donor ramets under high water/nutrient conditions and decreased it under high light. Physiological integration plays a strong role in clonal plant physiology, morphology and growth, especially for recipient ramets in heterogeneous environments. Therefore, physiological integration may have contributed to the widespread of clonal plants in nature and their dominance in many ecosystems. It may also play important roles in invasion success of alien clonal plants and in maintaining functions and stability of ecosystems where clonal plants are abundant.

The bromeliad ecosystem is integrated into the functioning of rainforest environments, but no study has ever estimated the secondary production, nor the biomass turnover rates of bromeliad macroinvertebrates in relation to other functional traits. We estimated secondary production at invertebrate population to metacommunity level in bromeliads of French Guiana. Coleoptera, Diptera and Crustacea with traits that confer resistance to drought had lower biomass turnover, longer generation times, and slower individual growth than species without particular resistance traits, suggesting convergent life history strategies in phylogenetically distant species. Detritivores and predators accounted for 87% and 13% of the overall annual production, respectively, but had similar production to biomass ratios. An average bromeliad sustained a production of 23.93 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1), a value which exceeds the medians of 5.0-14.8 g DM m(-2) year(-1) for lakes and rivers worldwide. Extrapolations to the total water volumes held by bromeliads at our field site yielded secondary production estimates of 226.8 +/- 32.5 g DM ha(-1) year(-1). We conclude that the ecological role of tank bromeliads in neotropical rainforests may be as important as that of other freshwater ecosystems.","[Dezerald, Olivier; Dejean, Alain] Univ Guyane, Univ Antilles, UMR Ecol Forets Guyane, CNRS,AgroParisTech,CIRAD,INRA, Campus Agron, F-97379 Kourou, France; [Dezerald, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, UMR Lab Interdisciplinaire Environm Continentaux, CNRS, Campus Bridoux, F-57070 Metz, France; [Leroy, Celine] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRA, AMAP,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Corbara, Bruno] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, LMGE, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Dejean, Alain; Cereghino, Regis] Univ Toulouse, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, Ecolab, CNRS,UPS,INPT, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Talaga, Stanislas] Univ Antilles, UMR Ecol Forets Guyane, Univ Guyane, AgroParisTech,CIRAD,CNRS,INRA, Campus Agron,BP 316, F-97379 Kourou, France",AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite des Antilles; INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); AgroParisTech; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite des Antilles; INRAE,"Dezerald, O (corresponding author), Univ Guyane, Univ Antilles, UMR Ecol Forets Guyane, CNRS,AgroParisTech,CIRAD,INRA, Campus Agron, F-97379 Kourou, France.;Dezerald, O (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, UMR Lab Interdisciplinaire Environm Continentaux, CNRS, Campus Bridoux, F-57070 Metz, France.",olivier.dezerald@gmail.com,"CEREGHINO, Regis/G-9500-2011; Leroy, Celine/I-4857-2016","Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248; Leroy, Celine/0000-0003-4859-8040; Talaga, Stanislas/0000-0003-1591-4115; CORBARA, Bruno/0000-0003-4232-8234; Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159; DEZERALD, OLIVIER/0000-0002-9987-9865",Agence Nationale de la Recherche throught the Rainwebs project [ANR-12-BSV7-0022-01]; Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; CNRS; FSE; Universite de Guyane,Agence Nationale de la Recherche throught the Rainwebs project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA)(French National Research Agency (ANR)); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); FSE(European Social Fund (ESF)); Universite de Guyane,"Financial support was provided by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche throught the Rainwebs project (grant ANR-12-BSV7-0022-01) and an Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA, ref.

Little is known, however, about the individual and relative importance for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling of non-random changes in plant and soil communities that result from global change phenomena, such as fertilization and agricultural intensification. We set up a field-based mesocosm experiment in which we re-inoculated soil with contrasting microbial communities taken from extensively managed and from intensively managed grasslands. In a full-factorial design, we subsequently established plant communities representative of intensively and extensively managed grasslands and imposed a fertilization treatment. We then measured plant biomass and diversity, and leaching of C and N as key measures of C and N loss. We hypothesized that non-random changes in both microbial and plant communities would impact C and N leaching, but via different mechanisms. We predicted that plant communities representative of extensively managed grassland would reduce C and N leaching directly through increased water or N uptake, or indirectly via promoting microbial communities that immobilize C and N, whereas plant communities of intensively managed grassland would have the opposite effect. We also hypothesized that microbial communities of extensively managed grassland would feed back positively to plant diversity and that matching' plant and microbial communities would reduce C and N leaching. We found that both plant and microbial communities from extensively managed grassland reduced C and N leaching, especially when matched'. Plant community effects on C and N leaching operated directly through root C inputs and N uptake, rather than through changes in soil microbial communities. In contrast, microbial communities modified C and N leaching both directly by immobilization and indirectly through modifying plant community composition. Synthesis. Our results show that changes in plant and microbial communities both individually and interactively modify C and N loss from grasslands. Moreover, our results suggest that soil microbial communities typical of extensively managed grassland might counteract, or delay, the negative consequences of fertilization on plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.","[De Vries, Franciska T.; Bardgett, Richard D.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Jorgensen, Helene Bracht; Hedlund, Katarina] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Lund University,"De Vries, FT (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.",franciska.devries@manchester.ac.uk,"de Vries, Franciska/AAD-5760-2021; Hedlund, Katarina/AAC-3333-2022; de Vries, Franciska T/D-3041-2009","de Vries, Franciska/0000-0002-6822-8883; de Vries, Franciska T/0000-0002-6822-8883",EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE,EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE,"This work was funded by the EU 7th Framework project SOILSERVICE.

However, few studies have modelled the long-term dynamics of dead wood, limiting our ability to predict how the abundance and composition of dead wood may change with climate change or altered fire regimes. Here we analyse DST and CWD data in 884 plots encompassing multiple field campaigns and forest types of varying canopy cover and species composition across the State of Victoria in temperate south-eastern Australia. We use boosted regression tree modelling to examine the relative influence of disturbance history and tree functional traits on dead wood biomass while accounting for the influence of environmental and climatic factors and stand attributes across a broad productivity gradient. We modelled absolute and relative dead wood biomass by size ('small' 100 < 200 mm diameter, 'medium' 200 < 500 mm diameter, 'large' > 500 mm diameter) and decay classes (sound to advanced decay) to evaluate the consistency of predictor effects among different components of dead wood. We found that live tree basal area and mean annual precipitation were influential predictors of both DST and CWD biomass, indicating an over-arching effect of forest productivity on dead wood biomass. Fire history was also an important predictor, with DST biomass decreasing and CWD biomass increasing with time since last wildfire. The proportion of large DST biomass increased with increased tree mortality as a result of fire interval and time in drought. DST biomass also increased and CWD biomass decreased with increasing wood density, and this was relatively more important than the other functional traits we examined (heartwood nitrogen content and bark type). Our study suggests that forest productivity, fire history, drought and wood density are important determinants of dead wood, as they influence dead wood inputs and outputs. Our study reveals the broad-scale drivers of dead wood biomass, and the potential for altered fire regimes and changing climate to influence liveto dead wood dynamics and associated ecosystem functions.","[Burton, Jamie E.; Bennett, Lauren T.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 4 Water St, Creswick, Vic 3353, Australia; [Kasel, Sabine; Nitschke, Craig R.; Fairman, Thomas A.; Parker, Linda; Fedrigo, Melissa; Aponte, Cristina] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia; [Tanase, Mihai A.; Aponte, Cristina] Natl Inst Res & Dev Forestry Marin Dracea, 128 Blvd Eroilor, Voluntari 077190, Ilfov, Romania; [Tanase, Mihai A.] Univ Alcala, Dept Geol Geog & Environm, C Colegios 2, Madrid 28801, Spain; [Fedrigo, Melissa] GeoRubix Solut, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Aponte, Cristina] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, Carretera La Coruna,Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; National Research & Development Institute in Forestry Marin Dracea; Universidad de Alcala; Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA),"Aponte, C (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 500 Yarra Blvd, Richmond, Vic 3121, Australia.;Aponte, C (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res & Dev Forestry Marin Dracea, 128 Blvd Eroilor, Voluntari 077190, Ilfov, Romania.;Aponte, C (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Dept Environm & Agron, Carretera La Coruna,Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jamie.burton@unimelb.edu.au; ltb@unimelb.edu.au; skasel@unimelb.edu.au; craign@unimelb.edu.au; tom.fairman@delwp.vic.gov.au; parker.l@unimelb.edu.au; cristina.aponte@inia.es,"Bennett, Lauren/AGO-0700-2022; Aponte, Cristina/AAV-5567-2020; Parker, Linda Marie/IQT-1622-2023; Tanase, Mihai/AAG-8049-2020; Kasel, Sabine/AFQ-7971-2022","Bennett, Lauren/0000-0003-2472-062X; Aponte, Cristina/0000-0002-8457-7573; Parker, Linda Marie/0000-0001-8952-1571; Burton, Jamie/0000-0001-9013-4616",Victorian DELWP through the Integrated Forest Ecosystem Research Program; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),Victorian DELWP through the Integrated Forest Ecosystem Research Program; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)),"This research was undertaken with approval by the Victorian Department of Environmental, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) under Research Permit Numbers 10006440, 10006488, 10006691, 10007105, and the Forests Act 1958 (FS/14/3694/1/3).

Although direct facilitation has accrued most of the evidence so far, indirect facilitation is ubiquitous in nature and it has an enormous potential to explain community structuring. In this study, we assess the effect of direct and indirect facilitation on community productivity via taxonomic and functional diversity. Methods In an alpine community on the Tibetan Plateau, we manipulated the presence of the shrub Dasiphora fruticosa and graminoids in a fenced meadow and a grazed meadow to quantify the effects of direct and indirect facilitation. We measured four plant traits: height, lateral spread, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of forbs; calculated two metrics of functional diversity [range of trait and community-weighted mean (CWM) of trait]; and assessed the responses of functional diversity to shrub facilitation. We used structural equation modelling to explore how shrubs directly and indirectly drove community productivity via taxonomic diversity and functional diversity. Key Results We found stronger effects from herbivore-mediated indirect facilitation than direct facilitation on productivity and taxonomic diversity, regardless of the presence of graminoids. For functional diversity, the range and CWM of height and SLA, rather than lateral spread and LDMC, generally increased due to direct and indirect facilitation. Moreover, we found that the range of traits played a primary role over taxonomic diversity and CWM of traits in terms of shrub effects on community productivity. Conclusions Our study reveals that the mechanism of shrub direct and indirect facilitation of community productivity in this alpine community is expanding the realized niche (i.e. expanding range of traits). Our findings indicate that facilitators might increase trait dispersion in the local community, which could alleviate the effect of environmental filters on trait values in harsh environments, thereby contributing to ecosystem functioning.","[Wang, Xiangtai; Meng, Lihua; Zhou, Xianhui; Chen, Shuyan; Du, Guozhen; Xiao, Sa] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Michalet, Richard] Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS 5805 EPOC, F-33405 Talence, France",Lanzhou University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux,"Xiao, S (autor correspondente), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, 222 Tianshui Rd, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",xiaos@lzu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830321, 31870412, 32071532, 31670435, 31670437, 41671038, 31770448]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program [2019QZKK0302]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program,"This research was supported by the Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830321, 31870412, 32071532, 31670435, 31670437, 41671038, 31770448) and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) Program (2019QZKK0302).",NA,51,5,6,11,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Most evidence for cross-taxon diversity relations come from above-ground consumers that directly interact with plants. Experimental tests of plant diversity effects on elusive organisms inhabiting the leaf litter layer, which are important for nutrient cycling and decomposition, are rare. Using a large tree diversity experiment, we tested whether tree diversity at the larger plot (i.e. community) or the smaller neighbourhood scale relates to the abundance, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity of leaf litter ants, which are dominant organisms in brown food webs. Contrary to our expectations of scale-independent positive tree diversity effects, ant diversity increased only with plot but not neighbourhood tree diversity. While the exact causal mechanisms are unclear, nest relocation or small-scale competition among ants may explain the stronger tree diversity effects at the plot scale. Our results indicate that even for small and less mobile organisms in the leaf litter, effects of tree diversity are stronger at relatively larger scales. The finding emphasizes the importance of diverse forest stands, in which mixing of tree species is not restricted to small patches, for supporting arthropod diversity in the leaf litter.","[Skarbek, Carl J.; Noack, Merle; Staab, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Germany; [Skarbek, Carl J.] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Biometry & Environm Syst Anal, Freiburg, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot, Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Bot Garden, Halle, Germany; [Bruelheide, Helge; von Oheimb, Goddert] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Haerdtle, Werner] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, Luneburg, Germany; [von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Tharandt, Germany; [Scholten, Thomas; Seitz, Steffen] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Soil Sci & Geomorphol, Tubingen, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Leuphana University Luneburg; Technische Universitat Dresden; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Staab, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, Freiburg, Germany.",michael.staab@nature.uni-freiburg.de,"Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013; von Oheimb, Goddert/O-9483-2015; Seitz, Steffen/B-7627-2016; Scholten, Thomas/E-4024-2012; Staab, Michael/I-6544-2019; Haerdtle, Werner/B-2568-2016","Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356; von Oheimb, Goddert/0000-0001-7408-425X; Seitz, Steffen/0000-0003-4911-3906; Scholten, Thomas/0000-0002-4875-2602; Staab, Michael/0000-0003-0894-7576; Hardtle, Werner/0000-0002-5599-5792; Skarbek, Carl/0000-0002-4100-6762",,,,NA,70,16,17,3,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Here, using the multiple linear regression models (MLMs) and structural equation models (SEMs), we evaluated how abiotic (i.e., soil nutrients and topography) and biotic [i.e., functional trait diversity (FTD) and functional trait identity (FTI)] factors regulate aboveground C (AGC) and topsoil (0-30 cm) organic C (SOC) stocks across 104 plots in temperate forests of Northern Iran. The optimal MLMs showed that the community-weighted mean (CWM) of wood density and functional divergence increased, but functional evenness decreased AGC stock, where FTI values contributed much (i.e., 74.40%) to the explained variance in AGC stock as compared to FTD indices (12.86%) and abiotic factors (12.74%). On contrary, SOC stock was mainly promoted by soil-available phosphorus, where abiotic factors contributed much (92.62%) to the explained variance as compared to FTD indices (6.73%) and FTI values (0.65%). The final best-fitted SEMs showed that AGC stock was strongly controlled (beta = 0.64) by FTI values (i.e., a latent variable of CWM of wood density and plant maximum height), whereas SOC stock was strongly controlled (beta = 0.74) by abiotic factors (i.e., a latent variable of soil-available phosphorus and total nitrogen).

Mixed planting may be an option to mitigate drought stress to plants, however, the extent to which mixed planting mitigates the indirect effect of drought (reduced plant-derived carbon input) on soil microorganisms remains unknown. Using soils from a young experimental plantation in Central Europe, we investigated whether mixed planting (oak monoculture, and oak admixed with 1-3 other tree species) under simulated drought (50% precipitation reduction for 2 years) influenced soil microbial activity, biomass and community composition. To focus on legacy effects - i.e. indirect effects mediated by plant composition and a history of drought, rather than direct effects of reduced water availability - soils were measured at a standardised moisture content (28 +/- 1% water holding capacity). Rates of bacterial growth and respiration were lower in soils with a legacy of drought. In contrast, fungal growth was not affected by a history of drought, suggesting that fungi were less adversely affected by reduced plant-input during drought, compared to bacteria. The effect of drought on the fungal-to-bacterial growth ratio was influenced by mixed planting, leading to a disproportionate decrease in bacterial growth in drought-exposed soils under oak monoculture than when oak was admixed with two or three different tree species. The presence of a particular tree species (with specific functional traits) in the admixture, rather than increased tree richness per se, may explain this response. Microbial biomass parameters, reflecting both the direct and indirect effects of past drought conditions, were consistently lower in drought-exposed soils than controls. While bacteria were more sensitive to the indirect effect of drought than fungi, the biomass concentrations suggested that the direct effect of reduced moisture affected both groups similarly. Overall, our findings demonstrate that drought can have lasting effects on microbial communities, with consequences for microbial function. Results also suggest that admixing oak with other tree species may alleviate the drought-legacy effect on bacteria and increase tolerance to future drought.","[Hicks, Lettice C.; Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Sect Microbial Ecol, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Rahman, Md Masudur; Carnol, Monique] Univ Liege, Lab Plant & Microbial Ecol, InBioS, Bot Bat 22,Chemin Vallee 4, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Verheyen, Kris] Univ Ghent, Forest & Nat Lab, Dept Environm, Geraadsbergseteenweg 267, B-9090 Melle Gontrode, Belgium",Lund University; University of Liege; Ghent University,"Hicks, LC (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sect Microbial Ecol, Dept Biol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",lettice.hicks@biol.lu.se,"Rahman, Masudur/ABC-5282-2020; Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010","Rahman, Masudur/0000-0003-2815-440X; Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262; Carnol, Monique/0000-0002-5814-8978; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Hicks, Lettice/0000-0002-0265-3887",short-term scientific mission (STSM) of the COST Action BioLink- Linking belowground biodiversity and ecosystem function in European forests [FP1305]; COST programme (European Cooperation in Science and Technology); Crafoord Foundation [20150561]; Swedish Research Council Formas [941-2015-270]; Swedish Research Council Vetenskapsradet [2015-04942]; Belgium Science Policy Office (BELSPO),short-term scientific mission (STSM) of the COST Action BioLink- Linking belowground biodiversity and ecosystem function in European forests; COST programme (European Cooperation in Science and Technology); Crafoord Foundation; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Belgium Science Policy Office (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),"We thank A.

We quantified AMF and DSE in roots of 62 plant species from contrasting habitats along an elevational gradient (3400-6150 m) in the Himalayas using a combination of optical microscopy and next generation sequencing. We linked AMF and DSE communities with host plant evolutionary history, ecological preferences (elevation and habitat type) and functional traits. We detected AMF in elevations up to 5800 m, indicating it is more constrained by extreme conditions than the host plants, which ascend up to 6150 m. In contrast, DSE were found across the entire gradient up to 6150 m. AMF diversity was unimodally related to elevation and positively related to the intensity of AMF colonization. Mid-elevation steppe and alpine plants hosted more diverse AMF communities than plants from deserts and the subnival zone. Our results bring novel insights to the abiotic and biotic filters structuring AMF and DSE communities in the Himalayas.","[Kotilinek, Milan; Kosnar, Jiri; Smilauerov, Marie; Smilauer, Petr; Dolezal, Jiri] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Hiiesalu, Inga; Altman, Jan; Dvorsky, Miroslav; Kopecky, Martin; Dolezal, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Kopecky, Martin] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Forestry & Wood Sci, Dept Forest Ecol, Kamycka 129, CZ-16521 Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Jiri] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 19,Nishi 8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Hokkaido University,"Kotilinek, M (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",kobrik@atlas.cz,"Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016; Smilauerova, Marie/D-7428-2016; Hiiesalu, Inga/A-9313-2015; Altman, Jan/B-4305-2015; Šmilauer, Petr/N-8313-2019; Kopecký, Martin/A-1466-2009","Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Smilauerova, Marie/0000-0002-0349-4179; Šmilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Kopecký, Martin/0000-0002-1018-9316; Kosnar, Jiri/0000-0001-5128-593X; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051; Hiiesalu, Inga/0000-0002-5457-2376","Czech Science Foundation [GACR 13-13368S, 17-19376S]; GACR [31-14-21432S]; Estonian Research Council [PUT-1170]; European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence EcolChange); RVO [67985939]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence EcolChange); RVO,We thank our technicians K.

Although this crucial role of nutrient availability in regulating ecosystem structure and functioning has been widely acknowledged, nutrients are still often neglected in observational and experimental synthesis studies due to difficulties in comparing the nutrient status across sites. In the current study, we explain different nutrient-related concepts and discuss the potential of soil-, plant- and remote sensing-based metrics to compare the nutrient status across space. Based on our review and additional analyses on a dataset of European, managed temperate and boreal forests (ICP [International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests] Forests dataset), we conclude that the use of plant- and remote sensing-based metrics that rely on tissue stoichiometry is limited due to their strong dependence on species identity. The potential use of other plant-based metrics such as Ellenberg indicator values and plant-functional traits is also discussed. We conclude from our analyses and review that soil-based metrics have the highest potential for successful intersite comparison of the nutrient status. As an example, we used and adjusted a soil-based metric, previously developed for conifer forests across Sweden, against the same ICP Forests data. We suggest that this adjusted and further adaptable metric, which included the organic carbon concentration in the upper 20 cm of the soil (including the organic fermentation-humus [FH] layer), the C:N ratio and pHCaCl2 of the FH layer, can be used as a complementary tool along with other indicators of nutrient availability, to compare the background nutrient status across temperate and boreal forests dominated by spruce, pine or beech. Future collection and provision of harmonized soil data from observational and experimental sites is crucial for further testing and adjusting the metric.","[Van Sundert, Kevin; Radujkovic, Dajana; Fernandez-Martinez, Marcos; Janssens, Ivan A.; Vicca, Sara] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Ctr Excellence PLECO Plants & Ecosyst, Antwerp, Belgium; [Cools, Nathalie; De Vos, Bruno] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Geraardsbergen, Belgium; [Etzold, Sophia] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Merila, Paivi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Oulu, Finland; [Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, CSIC, Global Ecol Unit, CREAF,CEAB, Catalonia, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep; Sardans, Jordi] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain; [Stendahl, Johan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Environm, Uppsala, Sweden; [Terrer, Cesar] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Terrer, Cesar] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, ICTA, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain","University of Antwerp; Research Institute for Nature & Forest; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Stanford University; Autonomous University of Barcelona","Van Sundert, K (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Ctr Excellence PLECO Plants & Ecosyst, Antwerp, Belgium.",Kevin.VanSundert@uantwerpen.be,"Martínez, Marcos Fernández/I-7240-2012; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Van Sundert, Kevin/M-3889-2018; Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Terrer, Cesar/R-1103-2018; Sardans, Jordi/AEM-0228-2022; Vicca, Sara/I-3637-2012; Stendahl, Johan/AAJ-2154-2021; Etzold, Sophia/AAA-2294-2022; Etzold, Sophia/N-9828-2017","Martínez, Marcos Fernández/0000-0002-5661-3610; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Van Sundert, Kevin/0000-0001-6180-3075; Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Terrer, Cesar/0000-0002-5479-3486; Sardans, Jordi/0000-0003-2478-0219; Vicca, Sara/0000-0001-9812-5837; Etzold, Sophia/0000-0002-5383-2228; Etzold, Sophia/0000-0002-5383-2228; Stendahl, Johan/0000-0002-9944-0297; Radujkovic, Dajana/0000-0003-4981-5879; De Vos, Bruno/0000-0001-9523-3453; Merila, Paivi/0000-0002-1315-6130; Cools, Nathalie/0000-0002-7059-2318","European Commission Funding Source: Medline; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Funding Source: Medline; European Research Council Synergy grant ERC-SyG-2013 IMBALANCE-P [610028] Funding Source: Medline; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [MDM-2015-0552] Funding Source: Medline","European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO); European Research Council Synergy grant ERC-SyG-2013 IMBALANCE-P; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities",,NA,133,24,25,14,135,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

In montane environments, complex topography is known to affect forest structure and composition, yet its role in determining trait composition, indices on community climatic tolerances, and responses to changing environmental conditions has not been fully explored. This study investigates how functional trait composition (characterized as community-weighted moments) and community climatic indices vary for the tree community as a whole and for its separate demographic components (i.e., dying, surviving, recruiting trees) over eight years in a topographically complex tropical Andean forest in southern Ecuador. We identified a strong influence of topography on functional composition and on species' climatic optima, such that communities at lower topographic positions were dominated by acquisitive species adapted to both warmer and wetter conditions compared to communities at upper topographic positions which were dominated by conservative cold adapted species, possibly due to differences in soil conditions and hydrology. Forest functional and climatic composition remained stable through time; and we found limited evidence for trait-based responses to environmental change among demographic groups. Our findings confirm that fine-scale environmental conditions are a critical factor structuring plant communities in tropical forests, and suggest that slow environmental warming and community-based processes may promote short-term community functional stability. This study highlights the need to explore how diverse aspects of community trait composition vary in tropical montane forests, and to further investigate thresholds of forest response to environmental change.","[Baez, Selene] Escuela Politecn Nacl Ecuador, Dept Biol, Quito, Ecuador; [Fadrique, Belen] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Feeley, Kenneth] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Dept Plant Ecol, Gottingen, Germany; [Feeley, Kenneth] Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, Coral Gables, FL USA; [Homeier, Juergen] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Biodivers & Sustainable Land Use CBL, Gottingen, Germany; [Homeier, Juergen] HAWK Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Fac Resource Management, Gottingen, Germany",Escuela Politecnica Nacional Ecuador; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds; University of Miami; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; HAWK University of Applied Sciences & Arts Hildesheim Holzminden Gottingen,"Baez, S (corresponding author), Escuela Politecn Nacl Ecuador, Dept Biol, Quito, Ecuador.",selene.baez@epn.edu.ec,"Homeier, Jürgen/G-1662-2011","Homeier, Jürgen/0000-0001-5676-3267; Baez, Selene/0000-0002-7236-6242","Escuela Politecnica Nacional del Ecuador [PII-ICB-01-2017]; German Science Foundation [Ho3296-2, Ho3296-4]",Escuela Politecnica Nacional del Ecuador; German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"SB, Grant Project PII-ICB-01-2017, Escuela Politecnica Nacional del Ecuador. www.epn.edu.ec JH, Grants Ho3296-2 and Ho3296-4 from The German Science Foundation, https://www.dfg.de The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",NA,85,5,5,3,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,APR 20,2022,17,4,,NA,,NA,,,e0263508,10.1371/journal.pone.0263508,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263508,NA,,20,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,2T6VD,35442987,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000822608900005,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial evidence shows that edge effects cause profound changes in forest biodiversity and productivity. However, the broader impacts of edge effects on ecosystem functioning remain unclear. Assessing the three-dimensional arrangement of forest elements has the potential to unveil structural traits that are scalable and closely linked to important functional characteristics of the forest. Using over 600 high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning measurements, we present a detailed assessment of forest structural metrics linked to ecosystem processes such as energy harvesting and light use efficiency. Our results show a persistent change in forest structural characteristics along the edges of forest fragments, which resulted in a significantly lower structural diversity, in comparison with the interior of the forest fragments. These structural changes could be observed up to 35 m from the forest edges and are likely to reflect even deeper impacts on other ecosystem variables such as microclimate and biodiversity. Traits related to vertical plant material allocation were more affected than traits related to canopy height. We demonstrate a divergent response from the forest understory (higher vegetation density close to the edge) and the upper canopy (lower vegetation density close to the edge), indicating that assessing forest disturbances using vertically integrated metrics, such as total plant area index, can lead to an erroneous interpretation of no change. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of terrestrial laser scanning for benchmarking broader-scale (e.g. airborne and space-borne) remote sensing assessments of forest distur-bances, as well as to provide a more robust interpretation of biophysical changes detected at coarser resolutions.","[Maeda, Eduardo Eiji; Nunes, Matheus Henrique] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, POB 68, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Calders, Kim] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Environm, CAVElab Computat & Appl Vegetat Ecol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [de Moura, Yhasmin Mendes] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [de Moura, Yhasmin Mendes] Univ Leicester, Ctr Landscape & Climate Res, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Raumonen, Pasi] Tampere Univ, Math, Korkeakoulunkatu 7, Tampere 33720, Finland; [Tuomisto, Hanna; Zuquim, Gabriela] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Verley, Philippe; Vincent, Gregoire] Univ Montpellier, INRAE, CNRS, CIRAD,IRD,AMAP, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Zuquim, Gabriela] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Aarhus, Denmark; [Camargo, Jose Luis] Natl Inst Amazonian Res INPA, Biol Dynam Forest Fragment Project BDFFP, 2936 Av Andre Araujo, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Maeda, Eduardo Eiji] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Helsinki; Ghent University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Leicester; Tampere University; University of Turku; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Aarhus University; Institute Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia; University of Hong Kong,"Maeda, EE (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Fac Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",eduardo.maeda@helsinki.fi,"Calders, Kim/O-5369-2017","Calders, Kim/0000-0002-4562-2538; Raumonen, Pasi/0000-0001-5471-0970; Campana Camargo, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0370-9878; Nunes, Matheus Henrique/0000-0001-9979-6456; Zuquim, Gabriela/0000-0003-0932-2308","Academy of Finland [318252, 319905, 340175]; Royal Society through the Newton International Fellowship [NF170036]; European Commission H2020 [HPC17TA3RL]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [835398]; Danish Council for Independent Research-Natural Sciences [9040-00136B]; Investissement d'Avenir grant [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Royal Society through the Newton International Fellowship(Royal Society); European Commission H2020(European Commission); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research CentreMarie Curie Actions); Danish Council for Independent Research-Natural Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Investissement d'Avenir grant(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This study was funded by the Academy of Finland (decision numbers 318252, 319905 and 340175) .

Several of these effects are mediated by the amount and spatial distribution of tree tissues. However, previous studies on tree diversity effects on fine-root biomass (FRB) have returned inconsistent results and did not distinguish between absorptive and transport fine roots. Furthermore, owing to the lack of species-specific data, it is not well understood whether complementarity or selection effects contribute more to these mixing effects. Here, we analysed tree species mixing effects on fine-root traits while considering the respective tree species contributions and root functional types. Specifically, we tested whether tree species mixing increases FRB and root length density (RLD) and results in vertical root stratification. We quantified FRB and RLD in 30-cm deep soil profiles for 13 tree species in mixed and pure stands across four widespread European forest types. The differentiation of different fine-root species in mixtures allowed us to disentangle complementarity and selection effects. Across all sites, mixtures supported on average less FRB than pure stands, which was reflected in negative complementarity and selection effects. RLD of absorptive fine roots did not change across the soil profile and even increased in the topsoil, which was associated with positive complementarity effects. There was no evidence for vertical root stratification. Conifer proportion, which was mainly associated with selection effects, dampened net diversity effects. Root functional type further influenced tree species mixing effects. Synthesis. Despite the underyielding of FRB in mixtures, overall soil occupation by absorptive fine roots (RLD) did not decrease in mixtures, pointing to morphological root trait adaptations associated with higher resource-use efficiency. Increased RLD in the most nutrient-rich layer in mixtures further indicates complementary interactions among species and a greater resource uptake capacity. This work illustrates that considering only one aspect of trait-functioning relationships, for example, root biomass, may not capture the full effect of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning. The integration of a larger range of relevant traits is required. Moreover, traditional classification of fine roots based on the 2-mm diameter cut-off may obscure responses of roots to environmental changes.","[Wambsganss, Janna; Beyer, Friderike; Bauhus, Juergen] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany; [Wambsganss, Janna; Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael] Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany; [Freschet, Gregoire T.] Univ Toulouse III, CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, Moulis, France",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Wambsganss, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Chair Silviculture, Freiburg, Germany.;Wambsganss, J (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Fac Biol, Geobot, Freiburg, Germany.",janna.wambsganss@gmail.com,"Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/AGB-4140-2022; Wambsganss, Janna/AAY-2148-2021; Beyer, Friderike/M-1108-2013; Bauhus, Jürgen/G-4449-2013","Scherer-Lorenzen, Michael/0000-0001-9566-590X; Wambsganss, Janna/0000-0002-2968-558X; Beyer, Friderike/0000-0002-3597-5022; Bauhus, Jürgen/0000-0002-9673-4986",SoilForEUROPE Project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Belgian Science Policy Office; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BA 2821/16-1 SCHE 695/10-1]; Research Foundation Flanders; The Swedish Research Council; Margarete-von-Wrangell Fellowship of the Ministry of Science and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; European Social Fund,SoilForEUROPE Project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); The Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Margarete-von-Wrangell Fellowship of the Ministry of Science and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"SoilForEUROPE Project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche; Belgian Science Policy Office; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: BA 2821/16-1 SCHE 695/10-1; Research Foundation Flanders; The Swedish Research Council; Margarete-von-Wrangell Fellowship of the Ministry of Science; Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg and European Social Fund",NA,89,12,12,6,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

The aim was to assess the extent to which the microbial biomass and activity, and community structure of fertilized upland grasslands are directly related to changes in soil N availability or indirectly related to individual plant species effects caused by changes in plant species composition and dominance. We investigated the short-term interactive effects of dominant plant species (Lolium perenne, Agrostis capillaris, Holcus lanatus and Festuca rubra) and nitrogen (N) amendment using an N-limited upland grassland soil. 2. In soils planted with different grass species, soil microbial biomass, and to some extent microbial activity, were determined by temporal changes in plant productivity. Variations in the way that individual plants influenced soil microbial biomass and activity were highly inconsistent over time, and largely independent of N-additions and differences in plant productivity. At the final sample date, those grass species which co-dominate the total plant biomass of intermediate fertility (H. lanatus) and semi-improved grasslands (A. capillaris and f. rubra) had a beneficial effect on the soil microbial biomass. In contrast, the dominant plant species of improved grasslands, L. perenne, had zero or a negative effect on soil microbial biomass. Two plant species (A. capillaris and H. lanatus) increased the proportion of fungi relative to bacteria in the soil microbial community, relative to the unplanted control soil and the other plant species. Lolium perenne and A. capillaris reduced the evenness of microbial PLFAs, suggesting negative effects of these plant species on the diversity of the soil microbial community. 3, The addition of N had no consistent effect on measures of soil microbial biomass or activity, but significantly altered the structure of the microbial community in favour of fungi. The lack of effects of N-addition on microbial biomass and activity were despite the finding that nitrogen addition reduced root biomass in all plant species and increased rhizosphere acidity. 4. The results suggest that in the short term, the abundance and activity of soil microorganisms in upland grasslands are regulated more by plant species traits than by a direct effect of nitrogen. These effects are likely to be related to variations amongst plant species in root exudation patterns and/or efficiency of nutrient aquisition. 5. Our study provides evidence that the functional characteristics of dominant plant species are important determinants of soil biological properties, and hence ecosystem functioning in temperate upland grasslands.","Univ Manchester, Sch Biol Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; AFRC, Inst Grassland & Environm Res, Aberystwyth SY23 3EB, Dyfed, Wales; Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA6 4YQ, England; Inst Grassland & Environm Res, N Wyke Res Stn, Okehampton EX20 2SB, Devon, England",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Aberystwyth University; N8 Research Partnership; Lancaster University,"Bardgett, RD (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Inst Environm & Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.",,"Rodwell, John J/C-4778-2008",,,,,NA,51,325,345,8,191,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

We examined N canopy budgets of 27 Central European forests of varying dominant tree species, stand density, and tree and shrub species diversity (Shannon index) in three study regions by quantifying bulk and fine particulate dry deposition and dissolved below canopy N fluxes. Average regional canopy N retention ranged from 16% to 51%, because of differences in the N status of the ecosystems. Canopy N budgets of coniferous forests differed from deciduous forest which we attribute to differences in biogeochemical N cycling, tree functional traits and canopy surface area. The canopy budgets of N were related to the Shannon index which explained 14% of the variance of the canopy budgets of N, suggesting complementary aboveground N use of trees and diverse understorey vegetation. The relationship between plant diversity and canopy N retention varied among regional site conditions and forest types. Our results suggest that the traditional view of belowground complementarity of nutrient uptake by roots in diverse plant communities can be transferred to foliar uptake in forest canopies.

This interaction between niche differences and environmental variability may also help explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but few data are available to rigorously evaluate this hypothesis. We assessed how a biologically relevant aspect of environmental heterogeneity interacts with species diversity to determine ecosystem processes in a natural rocky intertidal community. We used field removals to factorially manipulate biogenic habitat heterogeneity (barnacles, bare rock, and plots that were 50/50 mixes of the two habitat types) and gastropod grazer species richness and then tracked algal community succession and recovery over the course of 1 yr. We found that herbivore diversity, substrate heterogeneity, and their interaction played unique roles in the peak abundance and timing of occurrence of different algal functional groups. Early successional microalgae were most heavily grazed in diverse herbivore assemblages and those with barnacles present, which was likely due to complementary feeding strategies among all three grazers. In contrast, late successional macroalgae were strongly influenced by the presence of a habitat generalist limpet. In this herbivore's absence, heterogeneous habitats (i.e., mixtures of bare rock and barnacles) experienced the greatest algal accumulation, which was partly a result of complementary habitat use by the remaining herbivores. The complex way habitat identity and heterogeneity altered grazer-algal interactions in our study suggests species' differences and environmental heterogeneity both separately and interactively contribute to the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions.","[Whalen, Matthew A.; Stachowicz, John J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Whalen, Matthew A.; Aquilino, Kristin M.] Bodega Bay Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Whalen, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Whalen, MA (corresponding author), Bodega Bay Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",mawhal@gmail.com,,"Aquilino, Kristin/0000-0001-7292-4438",US National Science Foundation via a Graduate Research Fellowship; Biological Oceanography Program [OCE 08-50707]; NSF [OCE 03-51778]; UC Davis Chancellor's Fellowship,US National Science Foundation via a Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Biological Oceanography Program; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC Davis Chancellor's Fellowship,Funding for this research was provided by the US National Science Foundation via a Graduate Research Fellowship (KMA) and the Biological Oceanography Program (to JJS; grant number OCE 08-50707).

In these soils, mineralization of organic P can be the major source for orthophosphate. Both plants and microbes encode for phosphatases capable of mineralizing a range of organic P compounds. However, the activity of these enzymes depends on several edaphic factors including P availability, tree species, and microbial communities. Thus, phosphatase activity in both roots and the root microbial community constitute an important role in P mineralization and P nutrient dynamics that are not well studied in tropical forests. To relate phosphatase activity of roots and bacteria in tropical forests, we measured phosphatase activity in roots and bacterial isolates as well as bacterial community composition from the rhizosphere. Three forests in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico were selected to represent a range of soil P availability as measured using the resin P method. Within each site, a minimum of three tree species were chosen to sample. Root and bacterial phosphatase activity were both measured using a colorimetric assay with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate for the phosphomonoesterase enzyme. Both root and bacterial phosphatase were chiefly influenced by tree species. Though tree species was the only significant factor in root phosphatase activity, there was a negative trend between soil P availability and phosphatase activity in linear regressions of average root phosphatase and resin P. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance of bacterial community composition based on 16S amplicon sequencing indicated that bacterial composition was strongly controlled by soil P availability (p-value < 0.05). These results indicate that although root and bacterial phosphatase activity were influenced by tree species; bacterial community composition was chiefly influenced by P availability. Although the sample size is limited given the tremendous diversity of tropical forests, our study indicates the importance of roots and bacterial function to understanding phosphatase activity. Future work will broaden the diversity of tree species and microbial members sampled to provide insight into P mineralization and model representation of tropical forests.","[Cabugao, Kristine G.] Univ Tennessee, Bredesen Ctr Interdisciplinary Res & Grad Educ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Cabugao, Kristine G.; Childs, Joanne; Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Cabugao, Kristine G.; Childs, Joanne; Weston, David J.; Norby, Richard J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Timm, Collin M.; Carrell, Alyssa A.; Lu, Tse-Yuan S.; Pelletier, Dale A.; Weston, David J.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Cabugao, KG (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Bredesen Ctr Interdisciplinary Res & Grad Educ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Cabugao, KG (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.;Cabugao, KG (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",cabugaokm@ornl.gov,"Pelletier, Dale A/F-4154-2011; Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012; Weston, David J/A-9116-2011; Cabugao, Kristine Grace/HZK-6753-2023; Carrell, Alyssa/P-5255-2017","Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Weston, David J/0000-0002-4794-9913; Cabugao, Kristine Grace/0000-0002-1024-192X; Childs, Joanne/0000-0002-2002-7337; Carrell, Alyssa/0000-0003-1142-4709","Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics - United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research; United States Department of Energy [DE-AC05-00OR22725]","Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics - United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); United States Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported as part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics, funded by the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research.

Adaptive compositional change, however, is a foundational idea in evolutionary biology, whereby changes in gene frequencies within species boost population-level fitness, allowing populations to persist as the environment changes. Here, we present an analogous idea for ecological communities based on core concepts of fitness and selection. Changes in community composition (i.e., frequencies of genetic differences among species) in response to environmental change should normally increase the average fitnessof community members. We refer to compositional changes that improve the functional match, or fit, between organisms' traits and their environment as adaptive community dynamics. Environmental change (e.g., land-use change) commonly reduces the fit between antecedent communities and new environments. Subsequent change in community composition in response to environmental changes, however, should normally increase community-level fit, as the success of at least some constituent species increases. We argue that adaptive community dynamics are likely to improve or maintain ecosystem function (e.g., by maintaining productivity). Adaptive community responses may simultaneously produce some changes that are considered societally desirable (e.g., increased carbon storage) and others that are undesirable (e.g., declines of certain species), just as evolutionary responses within species may be deemed desirable (e.g., evolutionary rescue of an endangered species) or undesirable (e.g., enhanced virulence of an agricultural pest). When assessing possible management interventions, it is important to distinguish between drivers of environmental change (e.g., undesired climate warming) and adaptive community responses, which may generate some desirable outcomes. Efforts to facilitate, accept, or resist ecological change require separate consideration of drivers and responses, and may highlight the need to reconsider preferences for historical baseline communities over communities that are better adapted to the new conditions.","[Carroll, Tadhg; Dornelas, Maria; Thomas, Chris D.

However, we know little about how CE and SE are related to root traits and root dissimilarity. A 4-year field experiment was carried out with a split-plot design, where main plot was four nitrogen (N) applications (N0, N1, N2 and N3) and five cropping systems (maize Zea mays L./soybean Glycine max L. Merrill., maize/peanut Arachis hypogaea L. intercropped and the corresponding monocultures) with three replicates. Roots were sampled in the N0 and N2 treatments in 2 years. Intercropping effects were analysed based on grain yield for 4 years and roots were sampled down to 60 cm depth, and analysed with morphological parameters at different crop growth stages in 2 years. Intercropping significantly increased grain yield and above-ground biomass in both intercropping systems under all N treatments. The partitioning of the net intercropping effects showed that yield advantage in intercropping was due to a positive CE under the N0 treatment, and to a positive SE with N application. Maize showed greater root morphological plasticity than the legumes did, with greater changes in root length density (RLD), root weight density (RWD) and total root surface (TS) in intercropping than in monoculture. Intercropped maize occupied a larger soil space, while lateral RLD distribution of legumes was decreased by maize. The RLD, RWD and TS of intercropped maize were constant or increased in later growth stages. SE showed a significantly positive relationship with root dissimilarity. Principal component analysis showed mean root depth and specific root length of legumes drove the positive CE in the absence of N fertilization. Root dissimilarity determined by maize explained the selection effects in overyielding. Complementarity effects under N0 were closely associated with specific root traits such as mean root depth and specific root length. Linking changes of root traits with intercropping effects above-ground helps understand yield advantages in diverse agroecosystem. In general, a cereal species with strong phenotypic plasticity intercropped with a legume species with strong physiological plasticity can maximize the yield advantage of intercropping.

However, we currently understand very little about the interactions between warming, loss of phytoplankton diversity and its impact on the oceans' primary production. We experimentally manipulated the species richness of marine phytoplankton communities under a range of warming scenarios, and found that ecosystem production declined more abruptly with species loss in communities exposed to higher temperatures. Species contributing positively to ecosystem production in the warmed treatments were those that had the highest optimal temperatures for photosynthesis, implying that the synergistic impacts of warming and biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning were mediated by thermal trait variability. As species were lost from the communities, the probability of taxa remaining that could tolerate warming diminished, resulting in abrupt declines in ecosystem production. Our results highlight the potential for synergistic effects of warming and biodiversity loss on marine primary production.","[Bestion, Elvire; Barton, Samuel; Garcia, Francisca C.; Warfield, Ruth; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England; [Bestion, Elvire] Univ Paul Sabatier, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, UMR 5321, F-09200 Moulis, France",University of Exeter; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier,"Bestion, E; Yvon-Durocher, G (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, England.;Bestion, E (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, UMR 5321, F-09200 Moulis, France.",e.bestion@outlook.com; g.yvon-durocher@exeter.ac.uk,"Barton, Samuel/HTR-9080-2023; Garcia, Francisca C./AAH-3828-2019; Bestion, Elvire/D-4281-2015; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/M-4600-2014","Barton, Samuel/0000-0003-2551-4297; Garcia, Francisca C./0000-0001-5363-1015; Bestion, Elvire/0000-0001-5622-7907; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel/0000-0002-1749-3417","NERC standard grant [NE/M003205/1, NE/M004740/1]; European Research Council [677278 TEMPDEP, 726176 FRAGCLIM]; Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2016-335]; Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation; NERC [NE/M003205/1, NE/M004740/1] Funding Source: UKRI",NERC standard grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by a NERC standard grant (NE/M003205/1; NE/M004740/1), a European Research Council Starting Grant (677278 TEMPDEP) and by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2016-335) awarded to GYD.

Increasing intraspecific diversity with cultivar mixtures is one way to increase diversity in agricultural systems. We examined the relationship between intraspecific diversity and yield in cultivar mixtures using a meta-analysis of 91 studies and >3,600 observations. Additionally, we investigated how environmental and management factors might influence this relationship, and if the yield stability of cultivar mixtures differed from that of monocultures. We found that the yield increased by 2.2% overall in cultivar mixtures relative to their monoculture components. Mixtures with more cultivars and those with more functional trait diversity showed higher relative yields. Under biotic stressors, such as disease pressure, and abiotic stressors, such as low levels of soil organic matter and nutrient availability, this diversity effect was stronger, resulting in higher relative yields. Finally, cultivar mixtures generally showed higher yield stability compared to monocultures, especially in response to annual weather variability at a site over time. This practice of mixing cultivars can be integrated into intensified cropping systems where species monocultures dominate, as well as in smallholder cropping systems where low-cost improvements are in demand. Overall, these results suggest that cultivar mixtures are a viable strategy to increase diversity in agroecosystems, promoting increased yield and yield stability, with minimal environmental impact.","[Reiss, Emily R.; Drinkwater, Laurie E.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Reiss, ER (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Hort, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",err76@cornell.edu,"Drinkwater, Laurie/AEG-7189-2022","Drinkwater, Laurie/0000-0002-0746-6765",USDA-NIFA Organic Transitions Program [NYC-145521],USDA-NIFA Organic Transitions Program,"This research was supported by USDA-NIFA Organic Transitions Program (Project number NYC-145521).

Yet, translating this knowledge into practical agricultural technologies is challenged by the intrinsic complexity of agroecosystems. Here, we review current strategies for plant microbiome manipulation, classifying them into three main pillars: (i) introducing and engineering microbiomes, (ii) breeding and engineering the host plant, and (iii) selecting agricultural practices that enhance resident soil and plant-associated microbial communities.

Apart from the search for local and adapted plant species that could complement or replace the widely used Sedum vegetation, practical problems such as weeds and gaps in the vegetation also still occur. Both weeds and gaps have been shown to impact EGR ecosystem service provisioning and preferences but have only received limited scientific attention. We therefore performed an in depth analysis of vegetation and local and regional environmental data gathered on 129 EGRs in Northern Belgium with a focus on understanding weeds and gaps. We found that gaps in the vegetation form a considerable issue on the studied EGRs, while weed cover is often relatively limited. Furthermore, we find that spontaneously colonizing plant cover is heavily impacted by substrate productivity and roof exposition, but is also influenced by planted species cover and the proximity of potential source habitats. For tree species cover, dispersal limitation plays an even more important role, while annual species are found to thrive on exposed roofs with a low planted functional diversity. Gap cover is found to decrease over age, and reduces with increasing substrate productivity. Finally, we provide design, construction and maintenance recommendations to prevent these problems based on our results and also discuss whether these issues should be considered a failure of EGRs as a system or as an opportunity for improved green roof functioning or the development of more 'natural' EGRs.","[Vanstockem, Jan; Somers, Ben; Hermy, Martin] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, BE-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Vanstockem, J (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Div Forest Nat & Landscape, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200E, BE-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",jan.vanstockem@kuleuven.be; ben.somers@kuleuven.be; martin.hermy@kuleuven.be,"Vanstockem, Jan/C-9019-2016; Somers, Ben/ABG-2016-2020","Vanstockem, Jan/0000-0001-9730-2838; Somers, Ben/0000-0002-7875-107X","Flanders Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO), Belgium [141074]","Flanders Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO), Belgium","This study was supported by the Flanders Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO), Belgium, grant 141074.",NA,82,11,11,1,26,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,1610-8167,,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

Understanding how environmental and evolutionary history constrain community resilience is critical to predicting shifts in future ecosystem function. The goal of our study was to understand how communities with different histories respond to environmental change with regard to shifts in elevation (temperature, nutrients) and introduced predators. We hypothesized that community responses to the environment would differ in ways consistent with local adaptation and initial trait structure. We transplanted plankton communities from lakes at different elevations with and without fish in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California to mesocosms at different elevations with and without fish. We examined the relative importance of the historical and experimental environment on functional (size structure, effects on lower trophic levels), community (zooplankton composition, abundance and biomass) and population (individual species abundance and biomass) responses. Communities originating from different elevations produced similar biomass at each elevation despite differences in species composition; that is, the experimental elevation, but not the elevation of origin, had a strong effect on biomass. Conversely, we detected a legacy effect of predators on plankton in the fishless environment. Daphnia pulicaria that historically coexisted with fish reached greater biomass under fishless conditions than those from fishless lakes, resulting in greater zooplankton community biomass and larger average size. Therefore, trait variation among lake populations determined the top-down effects of fish predators. In contrast, phenotypic plasticity and local diversity were sufficient to maintain food web structure in response to changing environmental conditions associated with elevation.","[Symons, Celia C.; Schulhof, Marika A.; Cavalheri, Hamanda B.; Shurin, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Symons, Celia C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Symons, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Biol Sci, Ecol Behav & Evolut Sect, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;Symons, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",csymons@uci.edu,,"Cavalheri, Hamanda/0000-0001-7838-9819; Symons, Celia C./0000-0003-4120-0327",NSF-DEB [1457737]; NSERC PGS-D; White Mountain MiniGrant; Valentine Research Grant; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1457737] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF-DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); NSERC PGS-D(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); White Mountain MiniGrant; Valentine Research Grant; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"NSF-DEB, Grant/Award Number: 1457737; NSERC PGS-D; Valentine Research Grant; White Mountain MiniGrant",NA,63,2,2,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Yet the potential consequences of climate-induced plant species losses for the functioning of these ecosystems are poorly understood. We investigated how climate change might alter the functional composition of grasslands for Konza Prairie, a diverse tallgrass prairie in central North America. With species-specific climate envelopes, we show that a reduction in mean annual precipitation would preferentially remove species that are more abundant in the more productive lowland positions at Konza. As such, decreases in precipitation could reduce productivity not only by reducing water availability but by also removing species that inhabit the most productive areas and respond the most to climate variability. In support of this prediction, data on species abundance at Konza over 16 years show that species that are more abundant in lowlands than uplands are preferentially reduced in years with low precipitation. Climate change is likely to also preferentially remove species from particular functional groups and clades. For example, warming is forecast to preferentially remove perennials over annuals as well as Cyperaceae species. Despite these predictions, climate change is unlikely to unilaterally alter the functional composition of the tallgrass prairie flora, as many functional traits such as physiological drought tolerance and maximum photosynthetic rates showed little relationship with climate envelope parameters. In all, although climatic drying would indirectly alter grassland productivity through species loss patterns, the insurance afforded by biodiversity to ecosystem function is likely to be sustained in the face of climate change.","[Craine, Joseph M.; Nippert, Jesse B.; Towne, E.

Species can have one or both of these mechanisms. They confer resilience, which may determine community composition through differential species persistence after fire. To predict ecosystem level responses to changes in climate and fire conditions, we examined the proportions of these plant fire-adaptive traits among woody growth forms of 2880 taxa, in eight fire-prone ecosystems comprising similar to 87% of Australia's land area. Shrubs comprised 64% of the taxa. More tree (>84%) than shrub (similar to 50%) taxa resprouted. Basal, epicormic and apical resprouting occurred in 71%, 22% and 3% of the taxa, respectively. Most rainforest taxa (91%) were basal resprouters. Many trees (59%) in frequently-burnt eucalypt forest and savanna resprouted epicormically. Although crown fire killed many mallee (62%) and heathland (48%) taxa, fire-cued seeding was common in these systems. Postfire seeding was uncommon in rainforest and in arid Acacia communities that burnt infrequently at low intensity. Resprouting was positively associated with ecosystem productivity, but resprouting type (e.g. basal or epicormic) was associated with local scale fire activity, especially fire frequency. Although rainforest trees can resprout they cannot recruit after intense fires and may decline under future fires. Semi-arid Acacia communities would be susceptible to increasing fire frequencies because they contain few postfire seeders. Ecosystems dominated by obligate seeders (mallee, heath) are also susceptible because predicted shorter inter-fire intervals will prevent seed bank accumulation. Savanna may be resilient to future fires because of the adaptive advantage of epicormic resprouting among the eucalypts. The substantial non-resprouting shrub component of shrublands may decline, but resilient Eucalyptus spp. will continue to dominate under future fire regimes. These patterns of resprouting and postfire seeding provide new insights to ecosystem assembly, resilience and vulnerability to changing fire regimes on this fire-prone continent.

However, past climatic conditions can shape microbial functional responses resulting in a 'legacy effect'. For instance, exposure to drier conditions in the field may shape how soil microbial communities respond to subsequent drought and drying and rewetting (DRW) events. We investigated microbial tolerance to low moisture levels ('resistance') and ability to recover after a DRW perturbation ('resilience') across a steep precipitation gradient in Texas, USA. Although differences in precipitation regime did not result in differences in resistance and resilience of soil microbes, microbial communities appeared to be generally resilient and resistant across the gradient, suggesting that frequent exposure to drought had characterised the trait distributions of microbial communities. Moreover, microbial communities from historically drier sites used carbon more efficiently during a DRW perturbation suggesting that long-term drought history leaves a legacy effect on microbial functions. This may have been due to an indirect effect of drought caused via precipitation-induced differences in primary productivity, influencing the availability of soil organic matter to microbes. Alternatively, different exposures to drought might have shaped the microbial 'readiness' to cope with the DRW disturbance. Microbial community composition was also linked to drought history, but was unrelated to variation in function. Synthesis. Exposure to drought can have both direct and indirect effects on soil microbial communities, which can result in lasting legacy effects on the functions they control.","[Leizeaga, Ainara; Hicks, Lettice C.; Rousk, Johannes] Lund Univ, Microbial Ecol MEMEG, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Manoharan, Lokeshwaran] Lund Univ, Natl Bioinformat Infrastruct Sweden NBIS, Lund, Sweden; [Manoharan, Lokeshwaran] Lund Univ, Div Occupat & Environm Med, Lund, Sweden; [Hawkes, Christine V.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hawkes, Christine V.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; North Carolina State University,"Leizeaga, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Microbial Ecol MEMEG, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden.",ainara.leizeaga@biol.lu.se,"Rousk, Johannes/E-9741-2010","Rousk, Johannes/0000-0002-4985-7262; Hicks, Lettice/0000-0002-0265-3887; Manoharan, Lokeshwaran/0000-0001-9751-5745; Leizeaga, Ainara/0000-0003-4014-7464; Hawkes, Christine/0000-0002-1043-9469","Svenska Forskningsradet Formas [2015-00270, 201801315]; Vetenskapsradet [2015-04942]; Crafoordska Stiftelsen [20150561]; Division of Environmental Biology [DEB 1546740]; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse [KAW 2017.0171]; Texas Ecolab Program",Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Crafoordska Stiftelsen; Division of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Texas Ecolab Program,"Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2015-00270 and 201801315; Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04942; Crafoordska Stiftelsen, Grant/Award Number: 20150561; Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: DEB 1546740; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse, Grant/Award Number: KAW 2017.0171; Texas Ecolab Program",NA,110,29,29,10,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Changes in key traits and functional diversity in Scottish grasslands were analysed for a resurvey of 561 grasslands sampled an average of 40 years apart and these changes correlated with changes in environmental drivers. There were clear differences between the responses of different grassland habitats; more productive habitats showed evidence of increased agricultural utilisation, whereas more unproductive habitats showed evidence of reduced exploitation. This was echoed in an increase in Functional Richness in unproductive habitats and a decrease in productive ones; the latter indicating increased habitat filtering in the heavily utilised, productive habitats. There were also overall shifts to later-flowering species and less availability of resources for pollinators in less productive habitats. Models relating changes in traits to the environment had little power, but did indicate the importance of pollution and that recovery from the peak in livestock numbers between the surveys had not fully worked through. Similarly, changes in functional diversity were poorly explained by changes in environmental drivers, though increased rainfall had positive impacts on Functional Evenness and Richness. Functional Divergence (measured by Rao's Q) was, however, strongly linked to changes in species traits over time. Scottish grasslands have diverged in how they have been utilised; more productive grasslands have been exploited more, resulting in shifts towards species with more exploitative growth strategies, a narrower range of growth and investment strategies, but a reduction in competitive dominance. The less productive grasslands appear to be utilised less, with shifts towards more conservative growth strategies and reduced habitat filtering, and the potential to deliver greater ecosystem multifunctionality. Resource declines for pollinators appeared to be universal across all grassland habitats.","[Pakeman, Robin J.; Hewison, Richard L.; Riach, David; Fisher, Julia M.; Fielding, Debbie A.; Mitchell, Ruth J.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Hurskainen, Sonja] Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol, Pentti Kaiteran Katu 1, Oulu 90014, Finland",James Hutton Institute; University of Oulu,"Pakeman, RJ (autor correspondente), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",robin.pakeman@hutton.ac.uk,"Mitchell, Ruth/F-4159-2010","Mitchell, Ruth/0000-0001-8151-2769; Hurskainen, Sonja/0000-0002-2721-4338",Strategic Research Programme of the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division [WP3.4],Strategic Research Programme of the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division,"This work would not have been possible without the many long hours spent in the field by E.L.

Making predictions across nested levels of biodiversity is therefore a major challenge for the development of intercropping practices. New prediction tools and concepts are required to design breeding strategies with desirable outcomes at the crop community level. We reviewed theoretical advances in the field of evolutionary ecology to identify potentially operational ways of predicting the effects of artificial selection on community-level performances. We identified three main types of approaches differing in the way they model interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) at the community level: (1) The community heritability approach estimates the variance for IIGE induced by a focal species at the community level; (2) the joint phenotype approach quantifies genetic constraints between direct genetic effects and IIGE for a set of interacting species; (3) the community-trait genetic gradient approach decomposes the IIGE for a focal species across a multivariate set of its functional traits. We discuss the potential operational capacities of these approaches and stress that each is a special case of a general multitrait and multispecies selection index. Choosing one therefore involves assumptions and goals regarding the breeding target and strategy. Obtaining reliable quantitative, community-level predictions at the genetic level is constrained by the size and complexity of the experimental designs usually required. Breeding strategies should instead be compared using theoretically informed qualitative predictions. The need to estimate genetic covariances between traits measured both within and among species (for IIGE) is another obstacle, as the two are not determined by the exact same biological processes. We suggest future research directions and strategies to overcome these limits. Our synthesis offers an integrative theoretical framework for breeders interested in the genetic improvement of crop communities but also for scientists interested in the genetic bases of plant community functioning.","[Firmat, Cyril] Univ Toulouse, AGIR, INRAE, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Firmat, Cyril; Litrico, Isabelle] INRAE, P3F UR 004, Le Chene RD150, Lusignan, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Firmat, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, AGIR, INRAE, Castanet Tolosan, France.;Firmat, C (corresponding author), INRAE, P3F UR 004, Le Chene RD150, Lusignan, France.",cyril.firmat@inrae.fr,,,,,,NA,92,0,0,2,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

As obligate plant symbionts, AMF harbor their own microbiota, both inside and outside the plant root system. AMF-associated bacteria (AAB) possess various functional traits, including nitrogen fixation, organic and inorganic phosphate mobilization, growth hormone production, biofilm production, enzymatic capabilities, and biocontrol against pathogen attacks, which not only contribute to the health of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis but also promote plant growth. Because of this, there is increasing interest in the diversity, functioning, and mechanisms that underlie the complex interactions between AMF, AAB, and plant hosts. This review critically examines AMF-associated bacteria, focusing on AAB diversity, the factors driving richness and community composition of these bacteria across various ecosystems, along with the physical, chemical, and biological connections that enable AMF to select and recruit beneficial bacterial symbionts on and within their structures and hyphospheres. Additionally, potential applications of these bacteria in agriculture are discussed, emphasizing the potential importance of AMF fungal highways in engineering plant rhizosphere and endophyte bacteria communities, and the importance of a functional core of AAB taxa as a promising tool to improve plant and soil productivity. Thus, AMF and their highly diverse bacterial taxa represent important tools that could be efficiently explored in sustainable agriculture, carbon sequestration, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to nitrogen fertilizer applications. Nevertheless, future studies adopting integrated multidisciplinary approaches are crucial to better understand AAB functional diversity and the mechanisms that govern these tripartite relationships.","[Basiru, Sulaimon; Mhand, Khadija Ait Si; Hijri, Mohamed] Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, African Genome Ctr, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco; [Hijri, Mohamed] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale IRBV, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Mohammed VI Polytechnic University; Universite de Montreal,"Hijri, M (corresponding author), Mohammed VI Polytech Univ UM6P, African Genome Ctr, Lot 660, Ben Guerir 43150, Morocco.;Hijri, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale IRBV, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",Mohamed.Hijri@umontreal.ca,,,,,,NA,140,0,0,24,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0940-6360,1432-1890,,MYCORRHIZA,Mycorrhiza,2023 MAR 24,2023,NA,,,NA,,NA,,,,10.1007/s00572-023-01107-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-023-01107-7,NA,mar.-23,19,Plant Sciences; Mycology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Plant Sciences; Mycology,A0DD2,36961605,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000951909000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evidence suggests there will be considerable inertia between climate change and shifts in plant species distributions, for example due to resident communities resisting changes, the redistribution of resident species' abundances, and dispersal limitation of species attempting to track preferred climates. Objectives To test how inertia in community responses to climate change may affect future primary productivity, and the capacity for communities to respond through local redistribution of abundances. Methods We assessed relationships between community functional trait distributions, climate and environment with a remote-sensed measure of gross primary productivity (GPP) across 1032 woody plant communities and projected these spatially under current and future climates. Using a simulation approach, we also tested the capacity for communities to achieve future trait distributions by shifting the relative abundances of resident species. Results We found that climate change is likely to reduce GPP in southeast Queensland, and, contrary to expectations, there is little evidence to suggest distributional inertia will contribute substantially to this loss. We show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well-placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through redistribution of resident species abundances. Conclusions Our results show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through abundance redistribution of resident species, but it is unlikely this will mitigate strong climate change-driven losses of productivity.","[McCarthy, James K.; Dwyer, John M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [McCarthy, James K.; Mokany, Karel] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT 2061, Australia; [McCarthy, James K.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Dwyer, John M.] CSIRO, EcoSci Precinct, Dutton Pk, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Landcare Research - New Zealand; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"McCarthy, JK (autor correspondente), Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand.",mccarthyj@landcareresearch.co.nz,"Mokany, Karel/C-1464-2009; Dwyer, John M./O-5579-2017; McCarthy, James K./E-9801-2010","Dwyer, John M./0000-0001-7389-5528; McCarthy, James K./0000-0003-3060-1678",,,,NA,74,1,1,6,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,1572-9761,,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

However, in naturally assembled communities where colonization occurs, resource competition may favor dominant traits, which eventually have the greatest influence on productivity. Here, in naturally developed long-term subalpine meadows (from 4-year to at least 40 years meadows) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we investigated the relationships between species richness and productivity to testify whether positive diversity-productivity relationships can still exist in naturally developed long-term communities. We also measured five functional traits (specific leaf area, photosynthesis rate, leaf proline content, seed mass and seed germination rate) to calculate two functional diversity indices: community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) which are highly correlated to functional traits of dominating species and variety of functional trait among all species. Finally, we quantified the relative contribution of species diversity, functional traits of dominating species and functional diversity among all species to productivity along the succession. We demonstrated strong positively diversity-productivity relationships in the natural sub-alpine meadow communities across time. The five traits of dominating species explained a large proportion (54-80%) of the variation in productivity during succession, whereas species diversity and functional diversity (FD) for each of the five traits explained much less (24-48% for species richness and 0-40% for FD for each of the five traits respectively). We found unequivocal evidence that significantly positive diversity-productivity relationships in the natural sub-alpine meadow communities across time are up to superior performers (dominant traits) in naturally developed communities where colonization occurs. As a result, understanding diversity-productivity relationships under the full range of community assembly processes therefore merits further investigation.","[Jiang, Kai; Tan, Zhaoyuan; He, Qifang; Wang, Lu; Zhao, Yang; Sun, Xinhang; Hou, Weichen; Long, Wenxing; Zhang, Hui] Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Eco, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Kai; Tan, Zhaoyuan; He, Qifang; Wang, Lu; Zhao, Yang; Sun, Xinhang; Hou, Weichen; Long, Wenxing; Zhang, Hui] Hainan Univ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Coll Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China",Hainan University; Hainan University,"Zhang, H (autor correspondente), Hainan Univ, Coll Forestry Wuzhishan Natl Long Term Forest Eco, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.;Zhang, H (autor correspondente), Hainan Univ, Key Lab Genet & Germplasm Innovat Trop Special Fo, Minist Educ, Coll Forestry, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.",993781@hainu.edu.cn,,,Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project [RH2000008233]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770469]; Hainan University [KYQD (ZR) 1876],Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hainan University,"This work was funded by Sanya Baopoling Mountain Scientific Research Project (RH2000008233), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31770469) and the start-up fund from Hainan University (KYQD (ZR) 1876).",NA,39,4,4,11,30,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 7,2020,10,1,,,,NA,,,13353,10.1038/s41598-020-70402-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70402-6,NA,,10,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,NC7XQ,32770030,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,4/5/2023,WOS:000561428300008,View Full Record in Web of Science,Rayana,sim,,sim,sim,não,grassland,temperate,positive,SLA;photosynthesis_rate;leaf proline content;SM(seed_mass);seed_germination(SG),NA,NA,ns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research revealed that not only species richness per se but also other facets of tree diversity, such as tree identity, have to be considered to understand the underlying mechanisms. One important ecosystem function in forests is the decomposition of deadwood that plays a vital role in carbon and nutrient cycling and is assumed to be determined by above- and belowground interactions. However, the actual influence of tree diversity on wood decay in forests remains inconclusive. Recent studies suggest an important role of microclimate and advocate a systematical consideration of small-scale environmental conditions. We studied the influence of tree species richness, tree species identity, and microclimatic conditions on wood decomposition in a 12-year-old tree diversity experiment in Germany, containing six native species within a tree species richness gradient. We assessed wood mass loss, soil microbial properties, and soil surface temperature in high temporal resolution. Our study shows a significant influence of tree species identity on all three variables. The presence of Scots pine strongly increased wood mass loss, while the presence of Norway spruce decreased it. This could be attributed to structural differences in the litter layer that were modifying the capability of plots to hold the soil surface temperature at night, consequently leading to enhanced decomposition rates in plots with higher nighttime surface temperatures. Therefore, our study confirmed the critical role of microclimate for wood decomposition in forests and showed that soil microbial properties alone were not sufficient to predict wood decay. We conclude that tree diversity effects on ecosystem functions may include different biodiversity facets, such as tree identity, tree traits, and functional and structural diversity, in influencing the abiotic and biotic soil properties.","[Gottschall, Felix; Davids, Sophie; Newiger-Dous, Till E.; Auge, Harald; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Gottschall, Felix; Davids, Sophie; Newiger-Dous, Till E.; Cesarz, Simone; Eisenhauer, Nico] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Auge, Harald] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany",Leipzig University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Gottschall, F (corresponding author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",felix.gottschall@idiv.de,"Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012; Auge, Harald/D-4802-2015; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Cesarz, Simone/AAA-8702-2020","Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Auge, Harald/0000-0001-7432-8453; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; Cesarz, Simone/0000-0003-2334-5119; Gottschall, Felix/0000-0002-1247-8728",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FZT 118],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FZT 118",NA,75,21,21,4,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality. Our sequence-based data showed differences in environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacteria at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, which led to different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. Studying the diversity of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized soils is critical for guiding soil restoration.","[Wan, Wenjie; Liu, Song; Li, Xiang; Xing, Yonghui; Chen, Wenli; Huang, Qiaoyun] Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiaoyun] Huazhong Agr Univ, Key Lab Arable Land Conservat Middle & Lower Reac, Minist Agr, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wan, Wenjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Huazhong Agricultural University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Botanical Garden, CAS","Chen, WL; Huang, QY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Huang, QY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Key Lab Arable Land Conservat Middle & Lower Reac, Minist Agr, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",wlchen@mail.hzau.edu.cn; qyhuang@mail.hzau.edu.cn,"Wan, Wenjie/AAT-7226-2021; Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012","Wan, Wenjie/0000-0001-7150-6138; Huang, Qiaoyun/0000-0002-2733-8066","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41830756, 42020104003]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFE0105600]; Technical Innovation Major Projects of Hubei Province [2018ABA092]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Technical Innovation Major Projects of Hubei Province,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41830756 and 42020104003) , the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFE0105600) , and Technical Innovation Major Projects of Hubei Province (2018ABA092) .",NA,70,24,24,36,142,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2379-5077,,,MSYSTEMS,mSystems,MAR,2021,6,2,,NA,,NA,,,e01221-20,10.1128/mSystems.01221-20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01221-20,NA,,15,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,SY4AC,33785569,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000665831100002,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,não,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change. 2. We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity hypotheses. 3. Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in 200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness, functional diversity and initial stand biomass. 4. Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during drought stress. 5. Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance. 6. In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured by low-rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density. 7. Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity, and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet forests, as stands with 'slow' trait values are 'fast' in terms of productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected; high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.","[Prado-Junior, Jamir A.; Schiavini, Ivan; Arantes, Carolina S.] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Ceara St, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Prado-Junior, Jamir A.; van der Sande, Masha T.; Lohbeck, Madelon; Poorter, Lourens] Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vale, Vagner S.] State Univ Goias, Forestry Dept, Ipameri Campus,Rd GO 330 Km 241, BR-75780000 Ipameri, Brazil; [van der Sande, Masha T.] Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Alterra, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lohbeck, Madelon] ICRAF, World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave, Nairobi, Kenya",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia; Wageningen University & Research; Universidade Estadual de Goias; Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF),"Prado, JA (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Ceara St, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.;Prado, JA (autor correspondente), Wageningen Univ, Forest Ecol & Forest Management Grp, POB 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",jamirjunior@yahoo.com.br,"Poorter, Lourens/AAL-1709-2021; Junior, Jamir Prado/O-5943-2014; Vale, Vagner/AAB-5950-2021; Vale, Vagner/F-3675-2017; Lohbeck, Madelon/M-6390-2014","Junior, Jamir Prado/0000-0003-1917-1283; Vale, Vagner/0000-0003-2155-9156; Vale, Vagner/0000-0003-2155-9156; Lohbeck, Madelon/0000-0002-3959-1800; van der Sande, Masha/0000-0002-6845-2308; Poorter, Lourens/0000-0003-1391-4875",Fundacao de Amparoa Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [283093]; Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs [KB-14]; Wageningen University;  [KB-14-003-030],"Fundacao de Amparoa Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); Role Of Biodiversity In climate change mitigatioN (ROBIN); Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands); Wageningen University; ","We are thankful for the forest owners for providing permission to work on their areas, our field assistants that help us carrying the data collection and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments on the manuscript.

They are the most important pathway of plant-derived C into the soil and facilitate most of the N and P uptake. In boreal and temperate forest ecosystems, the subgroup of ectomy-corrhizas is of special significance, and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is obligatory for a number of tree species. These fungal assemblages can be highly diverse, which is often contrasting with the relatively low number of tree species. This is also true for small monoculture stands, where several studies showed dozens of different ectomycorrhizal species. The elemental mechanisms that drive ectomycorrhizal community composition and structure, especially on larger scales, are still subject of debate. In particular, the role and function of most of the rare species remain largely unknown. In this chapter, we investigate the structural traits of ectomycorrhizal communities of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), one of the most important tree species in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. We therefore compiled data from ten different beech dominated sites across a European gradient to seek for ubiquitously valid statements regarding the species composition and community structure of ectomycorrhizae. A total of 205 ectomycorrhizal species were detected, of which 45% and 35% could be identified to the species and genus level, respectively. The majority of them are site-specific and found in very low abundances. A few species with narrow host range such as Lactarius subdulcis, Laccaria amethystina or Lactarius pallidus show low abundances on many sites. Three species, namely Hebeloma sinapizans, Lactarius salmonicolor and Elaphomyces aculeatus, appeared to be very dominant on one respective site. Cenococcum geophilum and Russula ochroleuca, both considered multi-host species, occur at all or rather several sites with relatively high abundances. Species ranking-abundance curves revealed a universal distribution pattern, with few dominant ectomycorrhizal species and a long tail of rare species. This shape is regardless of stand age and management practice, though no statistically significant correlations with species richness and the latter mentioned parameters could be found. By looking at several community structures, we were able to add another dimension of rarity and found most of the species not only being rare at a particular site, but also rare in terms of single appearance across several analysed stands. However, a vast part of ectomycorrhizal fungal species still remains unidentified. This circumstance further impedes our understanding concerning the occurrence of rare species. Yet, understanding their functional behaviour is of particular significance, as they could pose a key factor in ecosystem functioning, especially under changing climatic conditions.","[Rosinger, Christoph; Sanden, Hans; Godbold, Douglas L.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Rosinger, C (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Ecol, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",christoph.rosinger@boku.ac.at,,,"Marie Curie grant [GPF333996 LINKTOFUN]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I [LO1415]","Marie Curie grant(European Commission); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I","This work was supported by a Marie Curie grant GPF333996 LINKTOFUN to DG, and by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR within the National Sustainability Program NPU I, grant No. LO1415.",NA,65,1,1,3,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-63336-7; 978-3-319-63335-0,SUST PLANT CROP PRO,,,2017,NA,,,NA,,NA,143,156,,10.1007/978-3-319-63336-7_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63336-7_9,NA,,14,Agronomy; Ecology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2XZ,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000434216400009,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that the structural complexity of macrophytes positively modifies epiphytes and macroinvertebrates and that the interspecific interactions of epiphytes and macrophytes positively influence macroinvertebrates by synergism of epiphyte availability and increased habitat complexity. The macrophytes presented different structural complexities, ranging from low (Cyperus articulatus), medium (Nymphaea pulchella) to high complexity (Eichhornia crassipes and Ludwigia helminthorrhiza). The richness, diversity, and biomass of epiphytes presented a significant difference and positive relationship with the increase of the structural complexity of the macrophytes. The synergism between the structural complexity of the macrophytes and the epiphytic biomass (r(2) = 0.37; p = 0.0002), increased the biomass of macroinvertebrates (r(2) = 0.47; p = 0.003). The functional traits of the epiphytes were directly related to the morphology of the macrophytes with the unicellular, pedunculated, and firmly adhered dominating. The dominance of these traits indicates the absence or low disturbance (e.g., rain) in the studied site. The responses of the functional characteristics of the epiphytes are important to understand ecosystem functioning and dynamics. Therefore, we conclude that epiphytes showed a positive relationship with the structural complexity of the macrophytes. Moreover, macroinvertebrates showed a positive relationship with the increased macrophyte morphological complexity and increased biomass of epiphytes. The management of macrophytes with different structural complexities can be a strategy to recover the biodiversity in tropical aquatic ecosystems.","[do Nascimento Filho, Silvano Lima; Gama, Watson Arantes; Moura, Ariadne do Nascimento] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Bot, Rua D Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil",Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE),"Moura, AD (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Programa Posgrad Bot, Rua D Manoel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171030 Recife, PE, Brazil.",silvano.biouast@gmail.com; watsonarantes@gmail.com; ariadne_moura@hotmail.com,"Arantes Gama Jr, Watson/HLH-6351-2023; Gama, Watson Arantes W A/C-4911-2012","Gama, Watson Arantes W A/0000-0002-0458-5005",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) [304237/2015-9]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES) [001],Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"We thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) for a productivity Grant to ANM (Process 304237/2015-9), and the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brazil (CAPES)-Finance Code 001.

Increasing temperature, drought and greenhouse gases affect directly or indirectly the productivity of agricultural and natural ecosystems as well as human health. The nutrient supply capacity of the soil is diminishing, while food requirements for the growing population are increasing. The ongoing application of agrochemicals results in adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and food chain. Now, more than ever, there is a need to mitigate the effects of agricultural activities on climate change using environmentally friendly techniques. The role of plant beneficial microorganisms on this global challenge is increasingly being explored, and there is strong evidence that could be important. The use of functional microbial guilds forms an alternative or even a supplementary approach to common agricultural practices, due to their ability to act as biofertilizers and promote plant growth. Application of microbial inocula has a significantly lower impact on the environment compared to chemical inputs, while the agricultural sector will financially benefit, and consumers will have access to quality products. Microbial inoculants could play an important role in agricultural stress management and ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change. This short review highlights the role of microbes in benefiting agricultural practices against climate-changing conditions. In particular, the main microbial plant growth-promoting functional traits that are related to climate change are presented and discussed. The importance of microbial inoculants' multifunctionality is debated, while future needs and challenges are also highlighted.","[Kavadia, Athanasia; Omirou, Michalis; Ioannides, Ioannis M.] Agr Res Inst, Dept Agrobiotechnol, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Fasoula, Dionysia] Agr Res Inst, Dept Plant Breeding, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Kavadia, A (corresponding author), Agr Res Inst, Dept Agrobiotechnol, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus.",akavadia@ari.gov.cy; michalis.omirou@ari.gov.cy; dfasoula@ari.gov.cy; ioannide@ari.gov.cy,"Omirou, Michalis/V-8495-2019",,Research Promotion Foundation [ERANET-MED/0316/02],Research Promotion Foundation(Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF)),"This research was funded by Research Promotion Foundation, grant number ERANET-MED/0316/02.",NA,166,10,10,3,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,OCT,2020,11,10,,NA,,NA,,,1136,10.3390/atmos11101136,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101136,NA,,18,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OJ8DR,NA,gold,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000584185200001,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within grassland ecosystems, C and N cycles are strongly coupled by elemental stoichiometry of plant autotrophy and of soil microbial heterotrophy. Plasticity in plant form and function, plant species diversity and regulation of biological N fixation all contribute to stabilize the C:N ratio of organic matter inputs to soil. Soil processes such as the priming effect and nitrate leaching tend to restore stoichiometry by releasing elements in excess. Nevertheless, domestic herbivores tend to uncouple the C and N cycles, by releasing digestible C as CO2 and CH4, and by returning digestible N at high concentrations in urine patches. At low stocking density, herbivores enhance soil N cycling and net primary productivity, leading to an increased soil C sequestration, which however declines at high stocking density. Assuming no overgrazing, the environmental impacts of grassland intensification are therefore controlled by a trade-off between increased C N coupling by vegetation and increased C N decoupling by animals. Stimulation of vegetation by adequate N and P fertilizer applications increases the C flows from the atmosphere to the soil, while increasing stocking density reduces mean C residence time within the system. Intensification of grassland productivity by manipulation of both primary production and stocking density leads to complex responses in terms of environmental impacts: as intensification increases, positive impacts, such as C sequestration are progressively impaired by negative impacts linked to excessive active N forms. Hence, in each unique environmental setting, a threshold level of grassland intensification can be determined above which any additional animal production would be associated with unacceptable environmental risks. Improved grassland management and integration with crop systems may help minimize the harmful environmental effects of C-N decoupling by domestic herbivores, thereby enhancing synergies among food production, biodiversity and various other ecosystem services.

Our study provides one of the most comprehensive tests of how niche attributes, soil fertility and canopy attributes shape understory biomass in a forest restoration context. We investigated the relative effects on understory biomass of five categories of ecological variables related to five hypotheses - i) niche complementarity: functional diversity indices of understory plants, ii) mass ratio: community weighted mean (CWM) traits of understory plants, iii) overstory attributes: planted tree diameter, basal area, height, canopy cover and stem density, iv) soil nutrients: soil pH and soil C, N, P, and v) plantation type (an exotic broad-leaved monoculture, a native broad-leaved monoculture and a native conifer mix). Here, understory biomass was studied at two understory layers: high (2 to 7 m above ground) and low (less than 2 m above ground) in the plantations of subtropical area of Southern China. We surveyed vegetation, measured soil nutrients and determined five important leaf functional traits for each species. Multiple linear regression models were performed to select the best models and to assess the statistical significance of the effects of each variable. Our results showed that the best models for predicting biomass in the high (mean = 603.29 g m(-2)) and low (mean = 596.81 g m(-2)) layers were, respectively, the models for canopy cover and functional richness (FRic) interacting with plantation type. Model analyses showed a positive relationship between canopy cover and high-layer biomass (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively in native mixed-conifer and broad-leaved plantations) and between FRic and low-layer biomass (P < 0.001 in both native mixed-conifer and broad-leaved plantations) in the two native plantations. A positive relationship was also found between the CWM of leaf dry matter content and biomass in the high understory layer in the native mixed-conifer plantation (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, soil N was negatively correlated with low layer biomass (P < 0.01). Our study highlighted the dominant role of overstory attributes and niche complementarity in explaining forest understory productivity compared to other hypotheses. The effects of ecological factors on understory biomass varied in direction and magnitude, depending on understory stratum and plantation type. Indeed, the mechanisms behind biomass production in the high and low understory layers appeared to be decoupled. The typical biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship only drove low-layer biomass, while high-layer biomass was influenced by canopy cover.","[Wei, Liping; Rao, Xingquan; Lin, Yongbiao; Wang, Jun; Jian, Shuguang; Ren, Hai] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Engn Lab Vegetat Ecosyst Restorat Islands & C, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Gosselin, Frederic] INRAE, UR EFNO, F-45290 Domaine Des Barres, Nogent Sur Vern, France","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; INRAE","Jian, SG (autor correspondente), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Engn Lab Vegetat Ecosyst Restorat Islands & C, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China.",jiansg@scbg.ac.cn,,"Gosselin, Frederic/0000-0003-3737-106X; Wei, Liping/0000-0002-4296-9851",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31800455],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No.31800455).

Both species richness and identity significantly affected fungal biomass and conidial production (number and biomass of released spores), whereas only species identity had a significant effect on leaf mass loss. In mixed cultures, all measures of fungal functions were greater than expected from the weighted performances of participating species in monoculture. Mixed cultures outperformed the most active monoculture for biomass accumulation but not for leaf mass loss and conidial production. The three examined aspects of aquatic hyphomycete activity tended to increase with species richness, and a complementary effect was unequivocally demonstrated for fungal biomass.

Bamboos growth fast and display plastic functional traits, which favor the occupation of environments under different conditions, making them efficient C stockers in addition to providing raw material for local human populations. Asian bamboos are known to sequester considerable amounts of C in a short time, and although is likely that New World bamboo species have the same capacity, this perspective is rarely addressed. To evaluate the impact of a native bamboo on biomass and carbon stocks of an Atlantic Forest Protected Area, we first developed an allometric equation to estimate its live aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the destructive sampling method. We then compare our results to the AGB of forest components previously estimated for the same area, as well as to Asian and other Neotropical bamboo species to place our case study in a global scenario. In four 1-ha permanent plots in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, we made a census of all live culms and collected 20 healthy ones for equations purposes. The Merostachys neesii Rupr. (Poaceae) studied species has 343 clumps ha(-1), 3663 culms ha(-1), and 12.1 Mg ha(-1) of biomass (5.2 Mg C ha(-1)) or 4% of total AGB and C stocks of the studied area. M. neesii's contributes as much as palms solely, but more than lianas and tree ferns together for the total AGB in the old-growth Montane Atlantic Forest we studied. These results show that the non-inclusion of bamboos may underestimate the role of terrestrial ecosystems in buffering anthropogenic CO2. The comprehension of bamboo ecology is crucial for conservation and management purposes, and it is relevant since, with global warming, the C stored may be released turning these ecosystems into source instead of a sink of C.","[Gorgulho Padgurschi, Maira de Campos; Reis, Talita Soares; Joly, Carlos Alfredo] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Biol Inst, Plant Biol Dept, 255 Monteiro Lobato St, BR-13083862 Campinas, Brazil; [Alves, Luciana Ferreira] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Trop Res, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Vieira, Simone Aparecida] State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Ctr Environm Studies & Res, 155 Flamboyants St, BR-13083867 Campinas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Padgurschi, MDG (corresponding author), State Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Biol Inst, Plant Biol Dept, 255 Monteiro Lobato St, BR-13083862 Campinas, Brazil.",mairapad@gmail.com,"Vieira, Simone/H-1225-2011; Alves, Luciana/E-1141-2012; Joly, Carlos Alfredo/C-4523-2012","Vieira, Simone/0000-0002-0129-4181; Alves, Luciana/0000-0002-8944-1851; Joly, Carlos Alfredo/0000-0002-7945-2805","Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp) [07/57285-6, 2003/12595-7, 2008/50824-1, 2012/51509-8, 2012/51872-5, 2012/10851-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq/PELD 403710/2012-0]",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This work was supported by the S ~ao Paulo Research Foundation (Fapesp) via Master scholarship to MCGP (07/57285-6); via Biota/Fapesp Program grants (2003/12595-7, 2008/50824-1, 2012/51509-8, 2012/51872-5, 2012/10851-5); and by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnol ' ogico via Pesquisas Ecol ' ogicas de Longa Durac ~ao (CNPq/PELD 403710/2012-0).",NA,78,2,2,0,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1146-609X,1873-6238,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

Axonopus affinis Chase, the carpet grass, is a dominant creeping grass species in overgrazed grasslands. The species readily spreads, is highly tolerant of frequent defoliation and to trampling. In any natural environment, different light intensity regimes vary considerably along the day. Such phenomenon requires a high level of plasticity, resistance, and resilience from plants. Within this context, the aim of this study was to describe the mechanisms of photochemical activity in Axonopus affinis (Poaceae) in response to natural variations in daylight. Here we report hysteresis related functional behavior in overgrazed grasslands. This study was conducted in grassland vegetation within an experimental overgrazed area from the Embrapa Pecuaria Sul, Bage/Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (austral spring 2014). By means of preferential sampling, homogeneous areas with a 90% dominance of Axonopus affinis Chase were selected. In the present study 60 sample units were analyzed (young leaves, non-damaged and fully expanded). Photochemical variables and OJIP curves were sampled in two distinct conditions along one day, under light intensities labeled as: 1 - high photosynthetic photon flux density (HI), when under full sunlight; and 2 low photosynthetic photon flux density (LI), when under cloudy days. It was possible to quantify and identify the alternative stable states of A. affinis in response to light resource availability, expanding the interpretation of the multivariate analysis (triangular trajectory) and therefore, contributing to univariate metrics (bimodal trajectory). In this study, HI produced hysteretic behavior while LI of dynamic photoinhibition in A. affinis. The Delta F/F-m' variable was the most important mechanism to explain the plasticity of A. affinis in HI and LI (R-2 > 0.98 in function of the PCoA coordinates). However, the non-photochemical quenching activity was responsible for the stability in the OJIP curve. Therefore, A. affinis presented photochemical mechanisms that contribute to the occupation and dominance of overgrazed grasslands with different light regimes.","[Pinheiro, C.

Here we focus on the most burning issue: how to keep soils as carbon sinks while maintaining their productivity. Evidence shows that life in soils plays a crucial role in improving soil health yet soil ecological processes are often ignored in soil sciences. In this review, we highlight the potential of fungi to increase soil carbon sequestration while maintaining crop yield, functions needed to sustain human population on Earth and at same time keep the Earth livable. We propose management strategies that steer towards more fungal activity but also high functional diversity of fungi which will lead to more stable carbon sources in soil but also affects the structure of the soil food web up to ecosystem level. We list knowledge gaps that limit our ability to steer soil fungal communities such that stabilising carbon in top soils becomes more effective. Using the natural capacity of a biodiverse soil community to sequester carbon delivers double benefit: reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by storing photosynthesized carbon in soil and increasing agricultural yields by restoring organic matter content of degraded soils.","[Hannula, S.

However, despite global increases in the inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to ecosystems due to human activities, we lack a predictive understanding of how microbial communities respond to elevated nutrient inputs across environmental gradients. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of marker genes to elucidate the responses of soil fungal, archaeal, and bacterial communities using an N and P addition experiment replicated at 25 globally distributed grassland sites. We also sequenced metagenomes from a subset of the sites to determine how the functional attributes of bacterial communities change in response to elevated nutrients. Despite strong compositional differences across sites, microbial communities shifted in a consistent manner with N or P additions, and the magnitude of these shifts was related to the magnitude of plant community responses to nutrient inputs. Mycorrhizal fungi and methanogenic archaea decreased in relative abundance with nutrient additions, as did the relative abundances of oligotrophic bacterial taxa. The metagenomic data provided additional evidence for this shift in bacterial life history strategies because nutrient additions decreased the average genome sizes of the bacterial community members and elicited changes in the relative abundances of representative functional genes. Our results suggest that elevated N and P inputs lead to predictable shifts in the taxonomic and functional traits of soil microbial communities, including increases in the relative abundances of faster-growing, copiotrophic bacterial taxa, with these shifts likely to impact belowground ecosystems worldwide.","[Leff, Jonathan W.; Barberan, Albert; Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Leff, Jonathan W.; Steenbock, Christopher; Fierer, Noah] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Jones, Stuart E.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Prober, Suzanne M.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org Land & Water Flags, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Borer, Elizabeth T.; Hobbie, Sarah E.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Firn, Jennifer L.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Harpole, W.

However, whether positive canopy packing-diversity relationships are a general feature of forests remains unclear. Using crown allometric data collected for 12939 trees from permanent forest plots across Europe, we test (i) whether diversity promotes canopy packing across forest types and (ii) whether increased canopy packing occurs primarily through vertical stratification of tree crowns or as a result of intraspecific plasticity in crown morphology. We found that canopy packing efficiency increased markedly in response to species richness across a range of forest types and species combinations. Positive canopy packing-diversity relationships were primarily driven by the fact that trees growing in mixture had sizably larger crowns (38% on average) than those in monoculture. The ability of trees to plastically adapt the shape and size of their crowns in response to changes in local competitive environment is critical in allowing mixed-species forests to optimize the use of canopy space. By promoting the development of denser and more structurally complex canopies, species mixing can strongly impact nutrient cycling and storage in forest ecosystems.","[Jucker, Tommaso; Coomes, David A.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge, England; [Bouriaud, Olivier] Univ Stefan Cel Mare Suceava, Forestry Fac, Suceava, Romania",University of Cambridge; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Jucker, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Forest Ecol & Conservat Grp, Cambridge, England.",tj272@cam.ac.uk; dac18@cam.ac.uk,"Bouriaud, Olivier/GQI-3650-2022; Coomes, David A/H-5630-2011; Jucker, Tommaso/S-4724-2017; Bouriaud, Olivier/C-4700-2011","Jucker, Tommaso/0000-0002-0751-6312; Bouriaud, Olivier/0000-0002-8046-466X; Coomes, David/0000-0002-8261-2582",European Union [265171],European Union(European Commission),"We thank FunDivEUROPE site managers and field technicians for establishing the permanent plots and are grateful to D.

Here we compare patterns of leaf phenology, stem radial growth and branch growth of co-occurring savanna and forest trees in the Cerrado region of central Brazil to gain insight into the influence of these parameters in forest-savanna boundary dynamics. We hypothesized that forest species would have higher radial growth rates but later leaf flush than savanna species. We studied 12 congeneric species pairs, each containing one savanna species and one forest species. All individuals were growing in savanna conditions under full sun. We measured specific leaf area (SLA), light-saturated photosynthesis and monthly increments in stem circumference, branch length, leaf flush and leaf fall. Relative to savanna species, forest species had 68% higher diameter growth rates, 38% higher SLA, and displayed a greater crown area for a given basal area. Across species, radial growth was positively correlated with SLA (r(2) = 0 center dot 31), but not with CO2 assimilation. Peak leaf production of savanna species was in the late dry season, 1 month earlier than for forest species, which suggests a strategy to avoid nutrient losses during leaf expansion due to herbivory or leaching. However, savanna and forest species did not differ in annual branch growth, number of leaves produced per branch, or in timing of leaf fall. Radial growth was tightly coupled to monthly rainfall in forest species whereas the growth of savanna species ceased before the end of the wet season. The cessation of above-ground growth at a time of active photosynthesis may reflect a shift in allocation to roots and reserves. These results contribute to recent studies showing that savanna and forest species represent different functional types and that despite the limiting resources in savanna environments, forest trees that invade the savanna tend to present higher growth rates and larger and denser crowns, which enhance shading and could promote changes in equilibrium of forest-savanna boundaries.","[Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo; Franco, Augusto Cesar] Univ Brasilia, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Bot, Inst Ciencias Biol, BR-70904970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Hoffmann, William Arthur] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Universidade de Brasilia; North Carolina State University,"Franco, AC (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Lab Fisiol Vegetal, Dept Bot, Inst Ciencias Biol, Caixa Postal 04457, BR-70904970 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",acfranco@unb.br,"Franco, Augusto C/B-1615-2008; Hoffmann, William A./E-8894-2010; Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo/A-3521-2011","Franco, Augusto C/0000-0003-0869-5989; Hoffmann, William A./0000-0002-1926-823X; Rossatto, Davi Rodrigo/0000-0001-9510-8345",National Science Foundation [DEB-0542912]; AW Mellon Foundation; CNPq; CAPES,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); AW Mellon Foundation; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank Mundayatan Harisadan and Sybil Gotsch for critical review of this manuscript, Lucas C.R Silva for soil analysis, Lourens Poorter, Elmar Veenedaal and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions.

Additionally, trees act as vectors spreading bacterial cells in the air in urban environments due to the density of microbial cells on aerial plant surfaces. Characterizing tree leaf bacterial communities along an urban gradient is thus key to understand the impact of anthropogenic pressures on urban tree-bacterium interactions and on the overall urban microbiome. In this study, we aimed (i) to characterize phyllosphere bacterial communities of seven tree species in urban environments and (ii) to describe the changes in tree phyllosphere bacterial community structure and diversity along a gradient of increasing urban intensity and at two degrees of tree isolation. Our results indicate that, as anthropogenic pressures increase, urban leaf bacterial communities show a reduction in the abundance of the dominant class in the natural plant microbiome, the Alphaproteobacteria. Our work in the urban environment here reveals that the structures of leaf bacterial communities differ along the gradient of urban intensity. The diversity of phyllosphere microbial communities increases at higher urban intensity, also displaying a greater number and variety of associated indicator taxa than the low and medium urban gradient sites. In conclusion, we find that urban environments influence tree bacterial community composition, and our results suggest that feedback between human activity and plant microbiomes could shape urban microbiomes. IMPORTANCE In natural forests, tree leaf surfaces host diverse bacterial communities whose structure and composition are primarily driven by host species identity. Tree leaf bacterial diversity has also been shown to influence tree community productivity, a key function of terrestrial ecosystems. However, most urban microbiome studies have focused on the built environment, improving our understanding of indoor microbial communities but leaving much to be understood, especially in the nonbuilt microbiome. Here, we provide the first multiple-species comparison of tree phyllosphere bacterial structures and diversity along a gradient of urban intensity. We demonstrate that urban trees possess characteristic bacterial communities that differ from those seen with trees in nonurban environments, with microbial community structure on trees influenced by host species identity but also by the gradient of urban intensity and by the degree of isolation from other trees. Our results suggest that feedback between human activity and plant microbiomes could shape urban microbiomes.","[Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle; Messier, Christian; Kembel, Steven W.] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle; Messier, Christian; Kembel, Steven W.] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Foret, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; University of Calgary,"Laforest-Lapointe, I (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Laforest-Lapointe, I (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Calgary, AB, Canada.",isabelle.laforest.lapointe@gmail.com,,"Kembel, Steven/0000-0001-5224-0952; Laforest-Lapointe, Isabelle/0000-0003-3630-9475",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Canada Research Chairs Program,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),"Financial support was obtained from grants contributed by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), by the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies (FRQNT), and by the Canada Research Chairs Program.",NA,92,35,37,12,80,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",2379-5077,,,MSYSTEMS,mSystems,NOV-DEC,2017,2,6,,NA,,NA,,,e00087-17,10.1128/mSystems.00087-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00087-17,NA,,16,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Microbiology,FQ9VF,29238751,"Green Published, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000418709100003,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,não,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complementarity among tree species in resource acquisition strategy may reduce interspecific competition and increase the occurrence of facilitative interactions, resulting in an improved tree growth and resilience to extreme climatic events. However, the response of individual trees growing in more functionally diverse stands to extreme events is still under debate. We investigate the growth response of silver fir (Abies alba) to an extreme drought event which occurred in 1985-1986 in the Central Spanish Pyrenees and how the growth and resilience of trees relate to their neighbourhood functional diversity, stand heterogeneity and intraspecific and interspecific competition. Dendroecological methods were used to reconstruct radial growth. We recorded all tree species living around each sampled tree and calculated indices of intra- and interspecific competition among coexisting trees. Functional diversity around each focal tree was calculated by using the Rao's quadratic entropy. Silver fir growth decreased significantly in response to the drought in the vast majority of trees, but most of them showed a growth recovery 3years later. Despite most trees showed negative growth trends following the drought event (70%), those trees growing in more functionally diverse stands were more resilient, recovered more quickly and displayed greater growth and growth trends. Synthesis. The presented findings support the growing body of evidence that shows a positive impact of diversity on forest function. In addition, we provide a direct linkage between tree growth response to climate at the individual tree scale and a direct quantification of neighbourhood functional diversity and competition. An enhanced functional diversity facilitating a more efficient use of resources at the interspecific level and potentially increasing facilitative interactions contributes to lessening the negative impacts of extreme events as droughts on forest growth.","[Gazol, Antonio; Julio Camarero, J.] CSIC, IPE, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE),"Camarero, JJ (corresponding author), CSIC, IPE, Avda Montanana 1005, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",jjcamarero@ipe.csic.es,"Camarero, J.

Although effects on biodiversity have intensively been studied, little is known about the response of important ecosystem functions, in particular, water and nutrient cycling, to management intensification. We conducted a two-factorial grassland management experiment (GRASSMAN) with two cutting frequencies (one/three cuttings per year) and two fertilization levels (non-fertilized/N-fertilized) in a moderately species-rich temperate grassland to analyse the effects of management regimes on evapotranspiration (ET) and infiltration (I). Both were measured in the growing season 2009 with small, weighable lysimeters that contained undisturbed soil monoliths and vegetation. Aboveground biomass production (ANPP), belowground biomass, root length density, plant diversity, water use efficiency (WUE), and climatic factors were also measured. Fertilization with 180 kg N ha-1yr-1 increased aboveground biomass production by 50-70% and stand ET by 10-15% (or 20-40 mm), whereas I and ground water recharge decreased by about 50%. Consequently, fertilization increased the WUE of the grassland plants by 20-30%. However, increasing the mowing frequency from 1 to 3 had no significant effect. We found close relations between ANPP, ET and I and conclude that grassland management intensification influences the water balance primarily through fertilization effects on productivity. In areas of Central Europe with abundant grassland, ground water recharge must have significantly decreased with management intensification in the past 50 years.

Utilization of green manures can stimulate microbial activity and affect microbial composition and diversity. However, few studies focus on the microbial interactions or detect the key functional members in communities. With the advances of metagenomic technologies, network analysis has been used as a powerful tool to detect robust interactions between microbial members. Here, random matrix theory-based network analysis was used to investigate the microbial networks in response to four different green manure fertilization regimes (Vicia villosa, common vetch, milk vetch, and radish) over two growth cycles from October 2012 to September 2014. The results showed that the topological properties of microbial networks were dramatically altered by green manure fertilization. Microbial network under milk vetch amendment showed substantially more intense complexity and interactions than other fertilization systems, indicating that milk vetch provided a favorable condition for microbial interactions and niche sharing. The shift of microbial interactions could be attributed to the changes in some major soil traits and the interactions might be correlated to plant growth and production. With the stimuli of green manures, positive interactions predominated the network eventually and the network complexity was in consistency with maize productivity, which suggested that the complex soil microbial networks might benefit to plants rather than simple ones, because complex networks would hold strong the ability to cope with environment changes or suppress soil-borne pathogen infection on plants. In addition, network analyses discerned some putative keystone taxa and seven of them had directly positive interactions with maize yield, which suggested their important roles in maintaining environmental functions and in improving plant growth.","[Tao, Jiemeng; Meng, Delong; Qin, Chong; Liu, Xueduan; Liang, Yili; Liu, Zhenghua; Gu, Yabing; Yin, Huaqun] Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Meng, Delong; Qin, Chong; Liu, Xueduan; Liang, Yili; Liu, Zhenghua; Gu, Yabing; Yin, Huaqun] Cent South Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomet, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Tao, Jiemeng; Xiao, Yunhua; Li, Juan] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Hunan Agricultural University,"Yin, HQ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Yin, HQ (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomet, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Li, J (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",adalee619@163.com; yinhuaqun_cs@sina.com,"Meng, Delong/S-2665-2016; Meng, Delong/GRJ-8949-2022","Tao, Jiemeng/0000-0003-4998-1279; Meng, delong/0000-0003-0047-4196","National Nature Science Foundation of China [31570113, 41573072]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (nos. 31570113 and 41573072).

Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects-in particular, ocean warming and acidification. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photosymbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolution, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the -omics complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016-2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east-west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south-north transect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local replicates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high-throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a massive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.","[Planes, Serge; Banaigs, Bernard; Boissin, Emilie; Planes, S.; Banaig, B.; Boissin, E.; Iwankow, G.] PSL Res Univ, Univ Perpignan, Lab Excellence CORAIL, EPHE UPVD CNRS,USR 3278 CRIOBE, Perpignan, France; [Planes, Serge; Bowler, Chris; Galand, Pierre E.; Ghiglione, Jean-Francois; Romac, Sarah; Trouble, Romain; de Vargas, Colomban; Wincker, Patrick] Tara Oceans GOSEE, FR2022, Res Federat Study Global Ocean Syst Ecol & Evolut, Paris, France; [Allemand, Denis; Moulin, Clementine; Reynaud, Stephanie; Zoccola, Didier; Allemand, D.; Beraud, E.; Reynaud, S.; Zoccola, D.] Ctr Sci Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco; [Agostini, Sylvain] Shimoda Marine Res Ctr, Shimoda, Japan; [Boss, Emmanuel; Bourdin, Guillaume; Boss, E.; Bourdin, G.; Haentjens, N.; Karp-Boss, L.] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Bourdin, Guillaume; Lombard, Fabien; da Silva, O.; Dolan, J.

In this study, we use a large tree-ring database from thirty case studies across nine European countries and eleven species, covering from Mediterranean to hemiboreal forests, to test if the growth response to site specific drought events that occurred between 1975 and 2015 varied between mixed and monospecific stands. In particular, we quantify how stands resist those specific drought events and recover after them, thus analyzing their resilience. For each drought event and forest stand we calculated resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience and we related the variation in these indices between monospecific and mixed stands with type of admixture, tree species identity, site aridity gradient, stand basal area and stand age. We found a large variability among case studies, even for those that share similar species composition and have similar climates. On average, mixed stands showed higher resistance, resilience and relative resilience to drought events than monospecific stands. However, the beneficial effect of mixtures could not be generalized, being greatly modulated by the type of admixture and tree species identity, and depending on site water supply and stand characteristics, such as basal area and age. The increase in resilience in mixtures compared with monocultures was greater on the conifer-broadleaved admixtures, and to a lesser extent in the broadleaved-broadleaved combinations. The observed response patterns to drought largely varied among the eleven studied species, thus revealing the importance of functional traits for understanding a species' response to drought across its distribution range. Along the site aridity gradient, resilience and relative resilience to drought increased in drier sites for both monospecific and mixed stands, with an observed trend towards higher resilience in mixed stands in the drier and hotter sites. Our results confirm the complexity of the relationships found of resistance, recovery, resilience and relative resilience with drought when comparing pure vs mixed stands.","[Pardos, M.; del Rio, M.; Ruiz-Peinado, R.; Calama, R.] CIFOR, INIA, Forest Dynam & Management, Crtra Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pardos, M.; del Rio, M.; Bravo, F.; Riofrio, J.; Ruiz-Peinado, R.; Calama, R.] Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Av Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Pardos, M.; del Rio, M.; Bravo, F.; Riofrio, J.; Ruiz-Peinado, R.; Calama, R.] INIA, Av Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain; [Pretzsch, H.] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Chair Forest Growth & Yield Sci, Hans Carl V Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Jactel, H.] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO, INRAE, F-33610 Cestas, France; [Bielak, K.] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Silviculture, SGGW, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland; [Bravo, F.; Riofrio, J.] Univ Valladolid, Higher Tech Sch Agr Engn Palencia, Dept Plant Prod & Forest Resources, Valladolid, Spain; [Brazaitis, G.; Godvod, K.] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Inst Forest Biol & Silviculture, Studentu 11, LT-53361 Kaunas Distr, Lithuania; [Defossez, E.] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Lab Funct Ecol, Rue Emile Argand 11, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Engel, M.; Nothdurft, A.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Forest Growth, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Jacobs, K.; Ponette, Q.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2,Box L7-05-09, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Jansone, L.; Jansons, A.] Latvian State Forest Res Inst Silava, Rigas 111, LV-2169 Salaspils, Latvia; [Morin, X.] Univ Montpellier, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE,EPHE,UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Oreti, L.; Tomao, A.] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Agrofood & Forestry Syst DIBAF, SNC, Via San Camillo Lellis, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Pach, M.] Agr Univ Krakow, Dept Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Fac Forestry, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Uhl, E.] Bavarian State Inst Forestry LWF, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 1, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany","Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA); Universidad de Valladolid; Technical University of Munich; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Universidad de Valladolid; Vytautas Magnus University; University of Neuchatel; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Universite Catholique Louvain; Latvian State Forest Research Institute Silava; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Tuscia University; Agricultural University Krakow","Pardos, M (corresponding author), CIFOR, INIA, Forest Dynam & Management, Crtra Coruna Km 7-5, Madrid 28040, Spain.;Pardos, M (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, Av Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain.;Pardos, M (corresponding author), INIA, Av Madrid 44, Palencia 34004, Spain.",pardos@inia.es; delrio@inia.es; hans.pretzsch@tum.de; herve.jactel@inra.fr; kamil.bielak@wl.sggw.pl; fbravo@pvs.uva.es; gediminas.brazaitis@vdu.lt; emmanuel.defossez@unine.ch; markus_engel@gmx.de; Ksistof.godvod@vdu.lt; kristoffel.jacobs@uclouvain.be; liga.jansone@silava.lv; aris.jansons@silava.lv; Xavier.MORIN@cefe.cnrs.fr; arne.nothdurft@boku.ac.at; loredanaoreti@unitus.it; quentin.ponette@uclouvain.be; rlpach@cyf-kr.edu.pl; ruizpein@inia.es; antonio.tomao@unitus.it; enno.uhl@tum.de; rcalama@inia.es,"Jansons, Aris/AAX-1315-2021; Uhl, Enno/AEG-5231-2022; Nothdurft, Arne/C-9789-2019; Riofrío, José/F-1168-2016; Tomao, Antonio/ABG-3180-2021; del Río, Miren/F-2196-2013; Morin, Xavier/B-2790-2015; Pach, Maciej/R-5286-2016; Bravo, Felipe/C-5073-2009; Pretzsch, Hans/K-3716-2014; Pardos, Marta/A-4797-2015; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo/G-6751-2012","Jansons, Aris/0000-0001-7981-4346; Uhl, Enno/0000-0002-7847-923X; Nothdurft, Arne/0000-0002-7065-7601; Riofrío, José/0000-0003-2278-2851; Tomao, Antonio/0000-0001-6656-400X; del Río, Miren/0000-0001-7496-3713; Morin, Xavier/0000-0003-1961-8700; Pach, Maciej/0000-0002-9833-867X; Bravo, Felipe/0000-0001-7348-6695; Pretzsch, Hans/0000-0002-4958-1868; Pardos, Marta/0000-0002-5567-5406; Ruiz-Peinado, Ricardo/0000-0003-0126-1651; defossez, emmanuel/0000-0002-3279-9190; Brazaitis, Gediminas/0000-0003-0234-9292","ERA-Net SUMFOREST project RE-FORM Mixed species forest management.

We conducted a two-year experiment to assess the effects of two diversification practices-vetch-oat cover cropping and cucumber-snow pea intercropping-on nitrogen (N) cycling and productivity across a farm management gradient. The field experiment spanned 14 farms in southern Brazil with different long-term management histories, ranging from conventional tobacco to agroecological mixed crop-livestock systems. Along this gradient, farm soils with longer histories of agroecological management had higher soil organic carbon, potentially mineralizable carbon, and extractable phosphorus, captured by a principal component reflecting biological soil fertility.  We found that benefits of diversification practices for soil N cycling and productivity were ecologically relevant across the farm gradient within the two-year span of our experiment, with the greatest overall performance on agroecological farms. First, vetch-oat cover crops doubled mean N inputs to soil compared to fallows across all farms. Following cover crop incorporation, N mineralization was twice as high on agroecological farms as on transitioning or conventional farms. At vegetable planting, use of cover crop mixtures explained 67% of the variation in soil N availability, after accounting for the effects of background fertility. Finally, vegetable intercrops had higher productivity than monocrops across farms and years (mean LER=1.19), with stronger overyielding in the second year (mean LER=1.27). On a subset of farms, low soil pH constrained the performance of both diversification practices, reducing vetch N-2 fixation and vegetable intercrop yield (Land Equivalent Ratio, LER). While prior research has emphasized facilitation between diversified crops in lower fertility soils, our results suggest that diversification's advantages for nutrient cycling and productivity are robust to varied soil conditions and accrue over the course of transitions to agroecological management.","[Stratton, Anne Elise; Zak, Donald R.; Blesh, Jennifer] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Comin, Jucinei Jose; Siddique, Ilyas] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Agr Sci, Rod Admar Gonzaga 1346, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Filipini, Leticia Dambroz; Lucas, Renata Rodrigues] Ctr Study & Promot Grp Agr CEPAGRO, Rod Admar Gonzaga 1346, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Stratton, Anne Elise] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog Dept, De Bolelaan 1111, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Stratton, AE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Stratton, AE (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Environm Geog Dept, De Bolelaan 1111, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",a.stratton@vu.nl,"Zak, Donald R/C-6004-2012",,"US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) [P015B140095]; Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (NSF GROW) [GROW-88887.197505/2018-00]; US Department of Education Foreign Language and Area Studies Program; Brazilian Ministry of Education, Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES); Conservation, Food and Health Foundation; UM Library, International Institute, Department of Latin American and Caribbean Studies; ADVANCE Pro-gram; Rackham Graduate School","US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP); Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (NSF GROW); US Department of Education Foreign Language and Area Studies Program; Brazilian Ministry of Education, Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES); Conservation, Food and Health Foundation; UM Library, International Institute, Department of Latin American and Caribbean Studies; ADVANCE Pro-gram(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rackham Graduate School","Funding This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) and Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (NSF GROW) ; US Department of Education Foreign Language and Area Studies Program [FLAS grant number P015B140095] ; Brazilian Ministry of Education, Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES) [grant number GROW-88887.197505/2018-00] ; the Conservation, Food and Health Foundation; and multiple institutions at the University of Michigan (UM) , including the UM Library, International Institute, Department of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, School for Envi-ronment and Sustainability, UM-Brazil Initiative and ADVANCE Pro-gram, the Botanical Gardens and Campus Farm, and Rackham Graduate School.",NA,120,0,0,11,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-8809,1873-2305,,AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON,Agric.

Leaf production in the tropics is mainly constrained by water and light availability. Identifying the factors regulating leaf phenology patterns allows efficiently forecasting of climate change impacts. We conducted a novel phenological monitoring study across four Neotropical vegetation sites using leaf phenology time series obtained from digital repeated photographs (phenocameras). Seasonality differed among sites, from very seasonally dry climate in the caatinga dry scrubland with an eight-month long dry season to the less restrictive Cerrado vegetation with a six-month dry season. To unravel the main drivers of leaf phenology and understand how they influence seasonal dynamics (represented by the green color channel (Gcc) vegetation index), we applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to estimate the growing seasons, using water deficit and day length as covariates. Our results indicated that plant-water relationships are more important in the caatinga, while light (measured as day-length) was more relevant in explaining leafing patterns in Cerrado communities. Leafing behaviors and predictor-response relationships (distinct smooth functions) were more variable at the less seasonal Cerrado sites, suggesting that different life-forms (grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees) are capable of overcoming drought through specific phenological strategies and associated functional traits, such as deep root systems in trees.","[Alberton, Bruna; Morellato, Leonor Patricia Cerdeira] Univ Estadual Paulista Unesp, Inst Biociencias, Lab Fenol, BR-13506900 Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Torres, Ricardo da Silva] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Comp, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Sanna Freire Silva, Thiago] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [da Rocha, Humberto R.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Astron Geofis & Ciencias Atmosfer, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Moura, Magna S.

However, monoculture successional patterns lead to multiple ecological problems, such as soil nutrient deple-tion, biodiversity loss, and forest productivity decline. The introduction of broadleaf species into monospecific C. lanceolata plantations is an effective silvicultural practice driven by the demands to restore soil fertility and produce timber. A comprehensive understanding of how mixed afforestation patterns drive soil microbial community compositions and diversity can aid in the evaluation of the effects of broadleaf trees (Phoebe bournei) on forest soil-plant-microbe ecosystem functions. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of conversion from C. lanceolata monoculture plantations to mixed plantations (C. lanceolata-Phoebe bournei) on the soil mi-crobial community by measuring soil physicochemical properties and sequencing the 16S and ITS rRNA genes. The results showed that (1) the effect of forest conversion on bacterial alpha diversity was larger than that on fungal diversity, and the soil microbial community structure of both bacteria and fungi significantly differed between the two interplanting practices; (2) the co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and fungi displayed more connected and complex networks in mixed plantation networks, in which keystone taxa (i.e., Burkholderia and Steroidobacter) might play critical roles in the construction of the microbiome network; and (3) the results from VPA showed that the structure of the soil microbial community was strongly affected by soil environmental factors (e.g., pH). These findings suggest that the introduction of broadleaf species has significant impacts on the soil microbial community, increases the relative abundance of keystone taxa with important functional traits, and drives a more diverse microbial community network in mixed plantations.","[Ding, Kai; Zhang, Yuting; Yrjala, Kim; Tong, Zaikang; Zhang, Junhong] Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Sch Forestry & Biotechnol, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yrjala, Kim] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland",Zhejiang A&F University; University of Helsinki,"Tong, ZK; Zhang, JH (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, State Key Lab Subtrop Silviculture, Sch Forestry & Biotechnol, Hangzhou 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zktong@zafu.edu.cn; zhangjunhong@zafu.edu.cn,"ZHANG, YUTING/HOH-4131-2023",,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFD2201304]; Zhejiang Science and Technology Major Program on Agricultural New Variety Breeding [2021C02070-10],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Zhejiang Science and Technology Major Program on Agricultural New Variety Breeding,We would like to thank Liyao Chen and Shixiong Lin for their assistance in soil sampling and Huimin Zhang for her assistance in 16S and ITS data processing.

Although positive relationships between biodiversity and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage have been found in experimental grasslands, biodiversity effects on SOC storage in natural forests remain debated. Based on a large dataset from 523 forest inventory plots across subtropical forests in China, we tested the relationship between biodiversity and SOC storage and examined whether environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, soil properties) and litter quantity (leaf litter and root biomass) and quality (leaf litter carbon to nitrogen ratio [leaf litter C/N]) had effects on SOC storage. Furthermore, we used linear mixed-effects models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, environmental conditions, and litter quantity and quality on SOC storage. We used structural equation models to test how these variables directly or indirectly affected SOC storage. We found that species diversity, together with climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation), leaf litter C/N and root biomass determined SOC storage in subtropical forests at a large spatial scale. SOC storage was most strongly affected by climatic factors, followed by leaf litter C/N. Species diversity had both direct and indirect (through root biomass and leaf litter C/N) effects on SOC storage after accounting for environmental conditions. We also found that the positive diversity-SOC storage relationships were stronger in low and medium mean annual precipitation. Our findings highlight that higher species diversity can lead to higher SOC storage and therefore the conservation of biodiversity could play an important role in climate change mitigation.","[Li, Yin] Sanming Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Resources & Environm Monitori, Sanming 365004, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Yin; Liu, Xiaojuan; Xu, Wubing; Bongers, Franca J.; Chen, Guoke; Guo, Ke; Lai, Jiangshan; Mi, Xiangcheng; Zheng, Yuanrun; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wubing] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Xu, Wubing] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Bao, Weikai] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utilizat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Bao, Weikai] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat & Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichu, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin] Shanghai Chenshan Bot Garden, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Lin, Dunmei] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China; [Tian, Xingjun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xihua] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Zhejiang Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Yan, Junhua] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bo] Jingdezhen Univ, Key Lab Plant Resources & Biodivers Jiangxi Prov, 838 Cidu Ave, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Sanming University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chongqing University; Nanjing University; East China Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS","Ma, KP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, 20 Nanxincun, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",kpma@ibcas.ac.cn,"Bao, Weikai/H-1938-2012; Lin, Dunmei/I-6779-2012; Lai, Jiangshan/HMP-3513-2023; Bongers, Franca J./AAO-6769-2021","Bongers, Franca J./0000-0001-9517-4932; Xu, Wubing/0000-0002-6566-4452; Yang, Bo/0000-0002-6288-445X","Start-up Foundation for Advanced Talents in Sanming University [19YG18]; Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technologe in Fujian Province University [KC190002]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050404, XDA05050204]",Start-up Foundation for Advanced Talents in Sanming University; Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technologe in Fujian Province University; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"We are grateful to all the field investigators.

To understand the impacts of climate change on the function of Arctic tundra ecosystems within the global carbon cycle, it is crucial to improve the understanding of vegetation distribution and heterogeneity at multiple scales. Information detailing the fine-scale spatial distribution of tundra communities provided by high resolution vegetation mapping, is needed to understand the relative contributions of and relationships between single vegetation community measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes (e.g., similar to 1 m chamber flux) and those encompassing multiple vegetation communities (e.g., similar to 300 m eddy covariance measurements). The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine whether dominant Arctic tundra vegetation communities found in different locations are spectrally distinct and distinguishable using field spectroscopy methods; and (2) to test which combination of raw reflectance and vegetation indices retrieved from field and satellite data resulted in accurate vegetation maps and whether these were transferable across locations to develop a systematic method to map dominant vegetation communities within larger eddy covariance tower footprints distributed along a 300 km transect in northern Alaska. We showed vegetation community separability primarily in the 450-510 nm, 630-690 nm and 705-745 nm regions of the spectrum with the field spectroscopy data. This is line with the different traits of these arctic tundra communities, with the drier, often non-vascular plant dominated communities having much higher reflectance in the 450-510 nm and 630-690 nm regions due to the lack of photosynthetic material, whereas the low reflectance values of the vascular plant dominated communities highlight the strong light absorption found here. High classification accuracies of 92% to 96% were achieved using linear discriminant analysis with raw and rescaled spectroscopy reflectance data and derived vegetation indices. However, lower classification accuracies (similar to 70%) resulted when using the coarser 2.0 m WorldView-2 data inputs. The results from this study suggest that tundra vegetation communities are separable using plot-level spectroscopy with hand-held sensors. These results also show that tundra vegetation mapping can be scaled from the plot level (<1 m) to patch level (<500 m) using spectroscopy data rescaled to match the wavebands of the multispectral satellite remote sensing. We find that developing a consistent method for classification of vegetation communities across the flux tower sites is a challenging process, given the spatial variability in vegetation communities and the need for detailed vegetation survey data for training and validating classification algorithms. This study highlights the benefits of using fine-scale field spectroscopy measurements to obtain tundra vegetation classifications for landscape analyses and use in carbon flux scaling studies. Improved understanding of tundra vegetation distributions will also provide necessary insight into the ecological processes driving plant community assemblages in Arctic environments.","[Davidson, Scott J.; Phoenix, Gareth K.; Zona, Donatella] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Davidson, Scott J.; Sloan, Victoria L.; Oechel, Walter C.; Zona, Donatella] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Santos, Maria J.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Innovat Environm & Energy Sci, NL-3512 JE Utrecht, Netherlands; [Watts, Jennifer D.] Univ Montana, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, ISB 428,32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Oechel, Walter C.] Open Univ, Dept Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Sheffield; California State University System; San Diego State University; Utrecht University; University of Montana System; University of Montana; Open University - UK,"Davidson, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.;Davidson, SJ (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",sjdavidson1@sheffield.ac.uk; M.J.FerreiraDosSantos@uu.nl; cevls@bristol.ac.uk; jennifer.watts@ntsg.umt.edu; g.phoenix@sheffield.ac.uk; woechel@mail.sdsu.edu; d.zona@sheffield.ac.uk,"Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010; Oechel, Walter C/F-9361-2010; Davidson, Scott J./X-7650-2019; Zona, Donatella/S-5546-2019; Santos, Maria Joao/M-5034-2013","Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839; Oechel, Walter C/0000-0002-3504-026X; Davidson, Scott J./0000-0001-8327-2121; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839; Phoenix, Gareth/0000-0002-0911-8107; Santos, Maria Joao/0000-0002-6558-7477","Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF) [1204263]; NSF Office of Polar Programs; Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), an Earth Ventures (EV-1) investigation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Royal Society International Exchange [2013/R1]; NERC Arctic Research Programme, CYCLOPS Grant [NE/K00025X/1]; NERC PhD studentship; Directorate For Geosciences; Office of Polar Programs (OPP) [1204263] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/P002552/1, 1389341] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/P002552/1, NE/K00025X/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Office of Polar Programs(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), an Earth Ventures (EV-1) investigation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Royal Society International Exchange(Royal Society); NERC Arctic Research Programme, CYCLOPS Grant; NERC PhD studentship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Directorate For Geosciences; Office of Polar Programs (OPP)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was funded by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded to DZ (award number 1204263) with additional logistical support funded by the NSF Office of Polar Programs, and Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), an Earth Ventures (EV-1) investigation, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

A promising option is eco-functional intensification through organic farming, an approach based on using and enhancing internal natural resources and processes to secure and improve agricultural productivity, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. In this concept an active soil microbiota plays an important role for various soil based ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, erosion control and pest and disease regulation. Several studies have reported a positive effect of organic farming on soil health and quality including microbial community traits. However, so far no systematic quantification of whether organic farming systems comprise larger and more active soil microbial communities compared to conventional farming systems was performed on a global scale. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on current literature to quantify possible differences in key indicators for soil microbial abundance and activity in organic and conventional cropping systems. All together we integrated data from 56 mainly peer-reviewed papers into our analysis, including 149 pairwise comparisons originating from different climatic zones and experimental duration ranging from 3 to more than 100 years. Overall, we found that organic systems had 32% to 84% greater microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, total phospholipid fatty-acids, and dehydrogenase, urease and protease activities than conventional systems. Exclusively the metabolic quotient as an indicator for stresses on microbial communities remained unaffected by the farming systems. Categorical subgroup analysis revealed that crop rotation, the inclusion of legumes in the crop rotation and organic inputs are important farming practices affecting soil microbial community size and activity. Furthermore, we show that differences in microbial size and activity between organic and conventional farming systems vary as a function of land use (arable, orchards, and grassland), plant life cycle (annual and perennial) and climatic zone. In summary, this study shows that overall organic farming enhances total microbial abundance and activity in agricultural soils on a global scale.","[Lori, Martina; Symnaczik, Sarah; Maeder, Paul; Gattinger, Andreas] Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Dept Soil Sci, Frick, Switzerland; [Lori, Martina; Gattinger, Andreas] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Karl Glockner Str 21 C, Giessen, Germany; [De Deyn, Gerlinde] Wageningen Univ, Dept Soil Qual, Wageningen, Netherlands",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Wageningen University & Research,"Lori, M (corresponding author), Res Inst Organ Agr FiBL, Dept Soil Sci, Frick, Switzerland.;Lori, M (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Karl Glockner Str 21 C, Giessen, Germany.",martina.lori@fibl.org,"De Deyn, Gerlinde B/C-1593-2009; De Deyn, Gerlinde/AFI-8702-2022","De Deyn, Gerlinde B/0000-0003-4823-6912; De Deyn, Gerlinde/0000-0003-4823-6912",,,,NA,106,200,204,26,261,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,jul.-12,2017,12,7,,NA,,NA,,,e0180442,10.1371/journal.pone.0180442,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180442,NA,,25,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,FA7TK,28700609,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000405649600030,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying microbiomes indicative for soil fertility and crop production is important for the development of the next generation of sustainable agriculture. Earlier researches based on one-time sampling have revealed various indicator microbiomes for distinct agroecosystems and agricultural practices as well as their importance in supporting sustainable productivity. However, these microbiomes were based on a mere snapshot of a dynamic microbial community which is subject to significant changes over time. Currently true indicator microbiomes based on long-term, multi-annual monitoring are not available. Results Here, using samples from a continuous 20-year field study encompassing seven fertilization strategies, we identified the indicator microbiomes ecophysiologically informing on soil fertility and crop production in the main agricultural production base in China. Among a total of 29,184 phylotypes in 588 samples, we retrieved a streamlined consortium including 2% of phylotypes that were ubiquitously present in alkaline soils while contributing up to half of the whole community; many of them were associated with carbon and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, these phylotypes formed two opposite microbiomes. One indicator microbiome dominated by Bacillus asahii, characterized by specific functional traits related to organic matter decomposition, was mainly observed in organic farming and closely associated with higher soil fertility and crop production. The counter microbiome, characterized by known nitrifiers (e.g., Nitrosospira multiformis) as well as plant pathogens (e.g., Bacillus anthracis) was observed in nutrient-deficit chemical fertilizations. Both microbiomes are expected to be valuable indictors in informing crop yield and soil fertility, regulated by agricultural management. Conclusions Our findings based on this more than 2-decade long field study demonstrate the exciting potential of employing microorganisms and maximizing their functions in future agroecosystems. Our results report a most-wanted or most-unwanted list of microbial phylotypes that are ready candidates to guide the development of sustainable agriculture in alkaline soils.","[Zhang, Jianwei; Liu, Wenjing; Chen, Ruirui; Zhang, Jiabao; Lin, Xiangui; Feng, Youzhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianwei; Liu, Wenjing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dolfing, Jan] Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn & Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil Science, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Northumbria University","Feng, YZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",yzfeng@issas.ac.cn,"Dolfing, Jan/B-8641-2015","Dolfing, Jan/0000-0002-7220-530X; Zhang, Jianwei/0000-0002-6390-335X; Feng, Youzhi/0000-0002-8519-841X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771294]; National Key RD Program [2019YFC1520700]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS [2014271]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key RD Program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 41771294), National Key R&D Program (2019YFC1520700) and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS (Member No. 2014271).",NA,62,1,1,20,43,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2524-6372,,ENVIRON MICROBIOME,Environ.

The RGR, a measure of fitness, drives population dynamics and shapes lichens' large-scale distributions. In a climate change scenario, we need to know how external (macro- and microclimate, and nitrogen deposition) and internal factors (cortical pigments, chlorophyll and specimen size) affect RGR in these ecologically important canopy organisms. We used dominant pendulous hair lichens widely distributed across the boreal biome to test the hypothesis that precipitation drives RGR of pale (Alectoria sarmentosa, Usnea dasopoga) and dark species Bryoria fuscescensdifferently across a large-scale gradient from continental to oceanic climates (precipitation: 450-2,600 mm) in Scandinavia (60-64 degrees N, 5-19 degrees E). After transplanting lichens to lower branches of Picea abies in nine boreal forest sites for 1 year, we used linear mixed effects models to analyse how total precipitation, rainfall, number of days with rain, temperature sum, nitrogen deposition, light, chlorophyll a (an indicator of photosynthetic capacity) and size influenced their RGR. RGR was highest in the pale species (Alectoria and Usnea) and increased with amount and frequency of precipitation, with >3 times higher RGR in the wettest compared to the driest site. The number of days with rain was a better predictor of RGR than total precipitation or rain. By contrast, RGR of the dark Bryoria weakly increased with precipitation. RGR in all species increased with light and decreased with size. Chlorophyll a concentration, boosted by moderate nitrogen deposition, increased RGR of all species. In conclusion, rainfall likely drives the distribution of the pale species due to their higher RGR and abundance in wet climates but cannot explain why Bryoria dominates drier inland forests. Our results highlight that the functional links between rainfall and RGR depends on both colour of the lichens (pale vs. dark pigments) and water storage traits. Synthesis. Our findings may explain the global, regional and local distribution patterns of hair lichens and help us to predict how environmental hazards such as climate change and forestry influence these important boreal canopy components.","[Phinney, Nathan H.; Gauslaa, Yngvar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway; [Palmqvist, Kristin; Esseen, Per-Anders] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Umea University,"Esseen, PA (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",per-anders.esseen@umu.se,,"Esseen, Per-Anders/0000-0002-3128-5024",Svenska Forskningsradet Formas [2016-00553],Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2016-00553",NA,87,11,11,5,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem process regulating nutrient mineralization, microbial community composition and structure, carbon sequestration in the soil. Therefore it is important to find out the link between biodiversity and decomposition dynamic which is of key interest recently among ecologists, hence we took up eleven combinations of leaf litter mixtures of four multipurpose tree species commonly occurring together in western Himalayas to find out the direction, magnitude and drivers of litter mixing effect. We found positive non significant effect of litter diversity for all mixtures except two which showed antagonistic effects after three months of decomposition. But we found positive non additive effects (NAE)/interaction effects for all litter mixtures at later stage of decomposition i.e. after nine months. The strength of litter mixing effect varied from 5.45% to 14.75% among litter mixtures. The interaction effects are observed to be greater for those litter mixtures which are more heterogeneous with respect to initial nitrogen, and phosphorus content. However the effect of chemical diversity is more marked on interaction effect/ NAE than variation in single trait(N or P content) as revealed by R-2 value (coefficient of determination). Interaction effect values increased with increase in percent of fast decomposing species in the litter mixture but rate of increase decreased when the mixtures move towards homogeneity. Interaction effect also increased with increase in species richness significantly up to three species, thereafter the increase is non significant. Our results indicate that tree diversity alters decomposition dynamics of component species in the mixture. Chemical diversity is more important factor in determining non additive effect rather than taxonomic diversity of a mixture.","[Singhal, Vibha; Roy, Trisha; Singh, Charan] Indian Council Agr Res, Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Ghosh, Jyotirmoy] Indian Council Agr Res, Indian Inst Nat Resins & Gums, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India",Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Soil & Water Conservation; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Natural Resins & Gums,"Singhal, V (corresponding author), Indian Council Agr Res, Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",singhalvibha76@gmail.com,"Singh, Dr. Charan/ISB-0145-2023",,"ICAR-IISWC, Dehradun, India","ICAR-IISWC, Dehradun, India","Authors acknowledge the funding received from ICAR-IISWC, Dehradun, India for conducting this research studies.",NA,76,2,3,18,56,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,AUG,2021,203,,,NA,,NA,,,105281,10.1016/j.catena.2021.105281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105281,NA,mar.-21,9,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,SH8AF,NA,,NA,NA,6/5/2023,WOS:000654354000005,View Full Record in Web of Science,,não,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowing so is important for predicting the functioning of long-lived organisms, such as trees, in a rapidly changing climate. We investigated the leaf morphological warming responses of 18 tropical tree species with early (ES) abd late (LS) successional strategies, planted at three sites along an elevation gradient from 2400 m a.s.l. (15.2 degrees C mean temperature) to 1300 m a.s.l. (20.6 degrees C mean temperature) in Rwanda. Leaf size expressed as leaf area (LA) and leaf mass per area (LMA) decreased, while leaf width-to-length ratio (W/L) increased with warming, but only for one third to half of the species. While LA decreased in ES species, but mostly not in LS species, changes in LMA and leaf W/L were common in both successional groups. ES species had lower LMA and higher LA and leaf W/L compared to LS species. Values of LMA and LA of juvenile trees in this study were mostly similar to corresponding data on four mature tree species in another elevation-gradient study in Rwanda, indicating that our results are applicable also to mature forest trees. We conclude that leaf morphological responses to warming differ greatly between both successional groups and individual species, with potential consequences for species competitiveness and community composition in a warmer climate.","[Manishimwe, Aloysie; Ntirugulirwa, Bonaventure; Nyirambangutse, Brigitte; Mujawamariya, Myriam; Bizuru, Elias] Univ Rwanda, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ave Armee,POB 3900, Kigali, Rwanda; [Manishimwe, Aloysie; Ntirugulirwa, Bonaventure; Mujawamariya, Myriam; Dusenge, Mirindi E.; Uddling, Johan; Wallin, Goran] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ntirugulirwa, Bonaventure] Rwanda Agr & Anim Resources Dev Board, POB 5016, Kigali, Rwanda; [Ntirugulirwa, Bonaventure] Rwanda Forestry Author, POB 46, Muhanga, Rwanda; [Zibera, Etienne; Nsabimana, Donat] Univ Rwanda, Sch Forestry & Biodivers & Biol Sci, Coll Agr Anim Sci & Vet Med, POB 210, Musanze, Rwanda; [Nyirambangutse, Brigitte] Global Green Growth Inst, 19F Jeongdong Bldg,21-15 Jeongdon Gil, Seoul 04518, South Korea; [Dusenge, Mirindi E.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Rwanda; University of Gothenburg; University of Rwanda; University of Exeter,"Manishimwe, A (corresponding author), Univ Rwanda, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ave Armee,POB 3900, Kigali, Rwanda.;Manishimwe, A; Wallin, G (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 461, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",aloysie.manishimwe@gmail.com; ntirugulirwabonaventure@gmail.com; zietienn@yahoo.fr; brigittenyiridandi@gmail.com; mmujawamariya@gmail.com; ericmirindi.dusenge@gmail.com; ebizuru@gmail.com; donatus_1999@yahoo.fr; johan.uddling@bioenv.gu.se; goran.wallin@bioenv.gu.se,"; Bizuru, Elias/O-4263-2014","Uddling, Johan/0000-0003-4893-1915; Dusenge, Mirindi Eric/0000-0003-4218-0911; Bizuru, Elias/0000-0002-9556-8082; Manishimwe, Aloysie/0000-0003-3947-7650; Wallin, Goran/0000-0002-5359-1102","Swedish Research Council (VR) [2015-03338]; Swedish Research Council for Environmental, Agricultural Science and Spatial Planning (Formas) [2015-1458]; University of Rwanda-Sweden","Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council for Environmental, Agricultural Science and Spatial Planning (Formas)(Swedish Research Council Formas); University of Rwanda-Sweden","We acknowledge funding from the Swedish Research Council (VR; grant 2015-03338) and the Swedish Research Council for Environmental, Agricultural Science and Spatial Planning (Formas; grant 2015-1458).

We used airborne remote sensing and partial least squares regression to quantify canopy foliar nitrogen (foliar N) across similar to 164 km(2) of wet lowland tropical forest in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. We determined the relative influence of climate and topography on the observed patterns of foliar N using a gradient boosting model technique. At a local scale, where climate and substrate were constant, we explored the influence of slope position on foliar N by quantifying foliar N on remnant terraces, their adjacent slopes, and knife-edged ridges. In addition, we climbed and sampled 540 trees and analyzed foliar N in order to quantify the role of species identity (phylogeny) and environmental factors in predicting foliar N. Observed foliar N heterogeneity reflected environmental factors working at multiple spatial scales. Across the larger landscape, elevation and precipitation had the highest relative influence on predicting foliar N (30% and 24%), followed by soils (15%), site exposure (9%), compound topographic index (8%), substrate (6%), and landscape dissection (6%). Phylogeny explained similar to 75% of the variation in the field collected foliar N data, suggesting that phylogeny largely underpins the response to the environmental factors. Taken together, these data suggest that a large fraction of the variance in foliar N across the landscape is proximately driven by species composition, though ultimately this is likely a response to abiotic factors such as climate and topography. Future work should focus on the mechanisms and feedbacks involved, and how shifts in climate may translate to changes in forest function.","[Balzotti, Christopher S.; Asner, Gregory P.; Martin, Roberta E.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Taylor, Philip G.; Townsend, Alan R.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Cleveland, Cory C.; Nasto, Megan] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Cole, Rebecca] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Osborne, Brooke B.; Porder, Stephen] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Carnegie Institution for Science; Duke University; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Brown University,"Balzotti, CS (corresponding author), Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cbalzotti@carnegiescience.edu,"Townsend, Alan/AAE-9602-2019; Porder, Stephen/ACT-2074-2022; Asner, Gregory/G-9268-2013; Martin, Roberta/A-5073-2015","Asner, Gregory/0000-0001-7893-6421; Martin, Roberta/0000-0003-3509-8530; Cleveland, Cory/0000-0002-8804-4248","Blue Moon Foundation; National Science Foundation [0918835, DEB 1263651]; John D. and Catherine T.

Methods We used man-made dendrometer bands to record radial increments of all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm and height >= 3 m within 25 comparative study plots (30 x 30 m for each) of the `Biodiversity- Ecosystem Functioning Experiment China' (BEF-China) in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, China. We measured stem circumferences twice a year from 2011 to 2014 to calculate absolute diameter growth rate of a warm and wet season (WWS, April to September) and a dry and cold season (DCS, October to the next March) for each individual tree: annual growth (GR(year)), growth during the WWS (GR(WWS)) and growth during the DCS (GR(DCS)). We firstly tested the differences in growth rates between different seasons using paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Then we applied linear mixed models to explore the effects of leaf habit, species identity, initial diameter, neighborhood interaction (indicated by richness, density and total basal area of all neighboring trees within a radius of 5 m around target trees), stand age and topography (elevation, slope and aspect) on tree growth rates of the two different seasons in three deciduous and 14 evergreen species. Important Findings GR(year), GR(WWS) and GR(DCS) varied between 0.04-0.50 cm year(-1) (mean = 0.21), 0.03 0.46cm season-(1) (mean = 0.18) and 0.01 0.05 cm season(-1) (mean = 0.03) across the 17 species, respectively. GR(WWS) was significantly higher than GR(DCS) for all species. Growth rates of faster growing species tended to have larger absolute differences between the WWS and DCS. Tree growth rates of both seasons and of the year (GR(year), GR(WWS) and GR(DCS)) varied significantly among leaf habit and species, and increased allometrically with initial diameter, decreased with stand age, but were not significantly related to topography and neighborhood richness or density. GRWWS decreased with neighborhood total basal area, while GRDCS did not. In conclusion, species might the temporally complementary, contributing to plot growth at different times of the year.","[Chi, Xiulian; Guo, Qiang; Fang, Jingyun; Tang, Zhiyao] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chi, Xiulian] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Natl Resource Ctr Chinese Mat Med, 16 Nanxiaojie,Dongzhimennei Ave, Beijing 100700, Peoples R China; [Schmid, Bernhard] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Peking University; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, CACMS; University of Zurich","Tang, ZY (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",zytang@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Tang, Zhiyao/B-8795-2008; Chi, Xiulian/A-8898-2015; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009","Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214","National Program on Key Basic Research Project [2014CB954004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31470486, 31321061]; 'Strategic Priority Research Program' of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05050301]; Sino Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation Program [IZL CZ 123883]",National Program on Key Basic Research Project(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 'Strategic Priority Research Program' of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Sino Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation Program,"National Program on Key Basic Research Project (#2014CB954004), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#31470486, 31321061), the 'Strategic Priority Research Program' of Chinese Academy of Sciences (#XDA05050301) and the Sino Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation Program (IZL CZ 123883).",NA,51,20,21,5,94,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.
