This repository contains the data and codes from the following book chapter:

**The use of functional traits in assessing productivity in natural ecosystems** by Bordin et al. (2024).

In this book chapter, we assessed the state of the art on the knowledge regarding the relationship between plant functional traits (in terms of functional diversity and dominance) and productivity, as a proxy for ecosystem processes. We conducted this evaluation on forest and grassland ecosystems, across tropical and temperate regions.

Repository content:

The `R` folder contains:

1.  Scripts to hamonise the dataset
2.  functional diversity analysis
3.  functional dominance analysis\

The `processed_data` folder contains:

-   dataset to conduct the analysis

-   dataset containg the trait categorisation

The `results` folder contains:

plots from functional diversity and functional dominance analysis

The code was developed and tested using the R statistical software, R version 4.2.2 (R Development Core Team, 2022).
